This article begins with an account of four phases of policy development, with the transition from one to the next marked by changes in thinking about dementia care being incorporated into policy and then expressed in programmes and in care practices. In the second part of the article, the goals and structure of the National Action Plan are outlined and its implementation and outcomes discussed.

Results indicate that a leftward shift in the climate of opinion, such as occurred in Germany, will have a serious impact on the value system of a society. The fundamental contrast between the values of freedom and equality is identified as being at the root of the left-right division and its corresponding value systems.","Inst Demoskopie Allensbach, D-78472 Allensbach, Germany; Univ Mainz, D-6500 Mainz, Germany","Noelle-Neumann, E (corresponding author), Inst Demoskopie Allensbach, D-78472 Allensbach, Germany.",,,,,,,17,12,12,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0954-2892,,,INT J PUBLIC OPIN R,Int.

First, that social justice constitutes an inherent part of the conception of sustainable development that the World Commission on Environment and Development outlined in Our Common Future (1987). The primary goal of the Commission was to reconcile physical sustainability, need satisfaction and equal opportunities, within and between generations. Sustainable development is what defines this reconciliation. Second, it is argued that this conception of sustainable development is broadly compatible with liberal theories of justice. Sustainable development, however, goes beyond liberal theories of justice in many respects. It is based on three assumptions, which are for the most part ignored in liberal theories: an accelerating ecological interdependence, historical inequality in past resource use, and the 'growth of limits'. These assumptions create a conflict between intra- and intergenerational justice, which is ignored in liberal theories, but which sustainable development tries to solve. It does so by imposing duties on developed countries that goes beyond liberal demands, and by abandoning the focus 'solely on protection' that dominates non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental sustainability.","RF Rogaland Res, N-4091 Stavanger, Norway","Langhelle, O (corresponding author), RF Rogaland Res, POB 2503 Ullandhaug, N-4091 Stavanger, Norway.",,,"Langhelle, Oluf/0000-0002-5583-8359",,,,81,56,58,0,29,WHITE HORSE PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"10 HIGH ST, KNAPWELL, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND CB3 8NR",0963-2719,,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Beck's risk society thesis, offers a conceptual starting point from which to address questions concerning the nature of contemporary risk politics, and the paper examines its relevance and applicability in this case. While Beck's theory provides insight into the nature of risk and directs attention to the ways in which notions of obligation and responsibility structure risk politics, it fails to engage with why, and how, particular definitions of risk and responsibility come to dominate the political arena. It is argued that in Australia the novel challenges climate change poses to the institutions of modernity have been negated through ensuing policy responses which have reinforced links between industry and government, and have defined climate responsibilities within existing relations of production and the spatio-temporal frameworks of modernity.","Univ Cambridge, St Catharines Coll, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England","Bulkeley, H (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, St Catharines Coll, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",,"Bulkeley, Harriet/Y-3348-2019",,,,,95,76,77,0,34,INST BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS,LONDON,"1 KENSINGTON GORE, LONDON SW7 2AR, ENGLAND",0020-2754,,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

Dilemmas in the care of the uninsured and underinsured,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,access to care; indigent; clinical decision making; underinsured; uninsured,PATIENTS PREFERENCES; JUSTICE,"When patients lack sufficient health care insurance, financial matters become integrally intertwined with biomedical considerations in the process of clinical decision making. With a growing medically indigent population, clinicians may be compelled to bend billing or reimbursement rules, lower standards, or turn patients away when they cannot afford the costs of care. This article focuses on 3 types of dilemmas that clinicians face when patients cannot pay for needed medical services: (1) whether to refer the individual to a safety net provider, such as a public clinic; (2) whether to forgo indicated tests and therapies because of cost; and (3) whether to reduce fees by fee waivers or other adjustments in billing. Clinicians' responses to these dilemmas impact on quality of care, continuity, safety net providers, and the liability risk of committing billing violations or offering nonstandard care. Caring for the underinsured in the current health care climate requires an understanding of billing regulations, a commitment to informed consent, and a beneficent approach to finding individualized solutions to each patient care/financial dilemma. To effect change, however, physicians must address issues of social justice outside of the office through political and social activism.","Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Med, Gen Internal Med Sect, Chicago, IL 60612 USA","Weiner, S (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Med, Gen Internal Med Sect, M-C 787,840 S Wood St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",,,,,,,29,25,25,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0884-8734,1525-1497,,J GEN INTERN MED,J.

Specifically, the concepts of equity and environmental justice have often been conflated into one even though they rest on different philosophical foundations and have different denotations, connotations and implications. The inconsistent use of these constructs is perverse in both scholarly discussions and global environmental policy formulation and detracts from conceptual clarity and their analytical usefulness. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to provide a mapping of the different takes to the moral aspects of global environmental decisions. Attempt is made to clarify the conceptual and philosophical denotations of environmental justice and equity from the point of view of philosophy, law and moral ethics. Our analysis leads to the construing of environmental justice as a broad overarching concept encompassing all justice issues in environmental decision-making, including both procedural and distributive justice, which is what is usually meant by equity. The resulting framework allows us to grasp the competing, conflicting and incomplete approaches to environmental justice as captured in the North-South conceptions of the construct more effectively. It is our hope that our conclusions would be valuable to researchers of global environmental change and politics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, social justice in the workplace is at least as much about the quality of social relationships as it is about statistical effects. Reaching workplace equity also involves the creation of a workplace climate where people with disabilities experience supportive and responsive supervision, along with a sense of being respected and valued.

In filling this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political sociology. We make the case and provide evidence that the US. military pursues a pattern of environmental bads that cannot be reduced to capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope conditions under which a treadmill of production and a treadmill of destruction are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a treadmill of destruction is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the treadmill of destruction by examining the environmental inequality endured by Native Americans at the hands of the US. military. We have collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War The geopolitical demands of remaining the world leading military power pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the dangers of this toxic legacy.","SW Texas State Univ, Dept Sociol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Smith, CL (corresponding author), SW Texas State Univ, Dept Sociol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",clsmith@txstate.edu,"Hooks, Gregory/R-7515-2019","Hooks, Gregory/0000-0002-8895-0312",,,,82,113,113,0,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

We argue that the key justice dilemmas of adaptation include responsibility for climate change impacts, the level and burden sharing of assistance to vulnerable countries for adaptation, distribution of assistance between recipient countries and adaptation measures, and fair participation in planning and making decisions on adaptation. We demonstrate how the climate change regime largely omits responsibility but makes a general commitment to assistance. However, the regime has so far failed to operationalise assistance and has made only minor progress towards eliminating obstacles for fair participation. We propose the adoption of four principles for fair adaptation in the climate change regime. These include avoiding dangerous climate change, forward-looking responsibility, putting the most vulnerable first and equal participation of all. We argue that a safe maximum standard of 400-500 ppm Of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and a carbon tax of $20-50 per carbon equivalent ton could provide the initial instruments for operationalising the principles.

In each case these nations are suffering not only because of bad geography or management. Rather, because of their colonial past and current positions in the world economy, they are brutally vulnerable to forces outside their control. We conclude by offering an explanation for generalized mistrust among Southern nations vis-a-vis Northern nations and the Kyoto treaty.","Millennium Challenge Corp, Washington, DC 20005 USA; Coll William & Mary, Dept Sociol, Williamsburg, VA USA","Parks, BC (corresponding author), Millennium Challenge Corp, 875 15th St, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",parksbc@mcc.gov,,,,,,63,50,50,1,69,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

It is argued that while these aspirations have produced important normative shifts in the rule-structure of global environmental management, they have not proved momentous enough to generate policies outside of what the prevailing neoliberal socio-economic regime might permit. Hence, although the texts of global environmental agreements accommodate concepts that express egalitarian notions of justice, core policies remain firmly rooted in market-based neoliberal interpretations of justice, which mainly serve to sustain the status quo.

This explanation cannot account for the significant population who know about and express concern for global warming. Ethnographic and interview data from a rural Norwegian community indicate that nonresponse is at least partially a matter of socially organized denial. Because Norwegian economic prosperity is tied to oil production, collectively ignoring climate change maintains Norwegian economic interests.

Operation Cremate Monsanto combined nationalist appeals, opposition to multinational capital, and rejection of genetic engineering in one integrated critique. The movement failed; Monsanto's technology spread rapidly and widely in India. The movement illustrated a larger problematic of understanding interests under conditions of rapid and complex technological change. Science continually presents new challenges to the way interests are understood by citizens and political classes that control states; the sea change in redefinitions of interests-of both individuals and states-introduced by, for example, the atmospheric science of ozone holes and climate change is archetypal, as are the internationally contentious battles in trade and property of genetically modified organisms. Interests in biotechnology are screened by science, understandings of which are unevenly distributed. Asymmetries of knowledge and skill repertory necessary for participation in global networks of contestation create new class positions within India, and corresponding contradictions in social movements. Cultural capital matters fundamentally in differentiating classes and class interests; authenticity rents become available to some class positions but not others.

Climate change, for example, will alter the nature of many protection forests in mountainous areas, exposing the inhabitants to increased risk from natural hazards. It will also affect the viability of plantation forests established in drier areas to combat desertification. Many forests are showing increased productivity, although the causes remain unclear. Sea-level change will destabilize coastal forests, particularly mangroves, reducing their effectiveness in coastal protection. Air pollution has already destabilized many forests, and is likely to be an increasing problem in the forests surrounding urban areas in developing countries.

In this context, it critiques UK policies to deliver social equity through transport programmes in light of its Climate Change Agenda and the identified need to significantly reduce traffic levels on UK roads. It identifies the potential synergy between these two policy ambitions, but argues that currently there is a serious policy conflict between these agendas within the UK policy framework. In the light of this conclusion, it offers some key recommendations on the best way forward, which it recommends must be based on the synergistic and integrated delivery of policies for social and environmental equity within the transport sector.

Whether one's concern about environmental epidemiology stems from the perspectives of environmental health, climate change, ecological collapse, or growing inequity, clear problems exist. Natural capital resources are being depleted; disregard for the integrity of ecosystems is entrenched in current business practices. Indeed, despite increasing rhetoric to the contrary, the disregard displayed by those who hold power globally toward long-term sustainability and, thus, the health and well-being of future generations, could be described as wanton. Six years ago, the Millennium Development Goals were announced by the United Nations as a rallying point for action to achieve a sustainable future, particularly by reducing the gap between the have mores and have nots. The attainment of these Goals is now endangered, as is, apparently, the spirit of optimism and idealism that inspired them at the Millennium Summit. We call for a reinvigoration of both concern about-and action on-sustainability. In particular, we appeal to those engaged in the field of environmental epidemiology (and other specialties with whom they engage) to consider how they might help by incorporating sustainability issues (including global ecological integrity and global environmental justice) into their own research programs. This incorporation would make a vital contribution to protect both present and future generations and to reduce resource and health gaps between North and South. Simply put, we propose that sustainability becomes integral to advancing the science of environmental epidemiology and related environmental disciplines.","Univ Alberta, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada; Deakin Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; Council Hlth Res Dev, Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; WHO, New York, NY USA","Soskolne, CL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 13-103 Clin Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada.",colin.soskolne@ualberta.ca,"London, Leslie/G-6061-2011; Butler, Colin D./H-2267-2019","Butler, Colin D./0000-0002-2942-5294",,,,24,18,20,0,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1044-3983,1531-5487,,EPIDEMIOLOGY,Epidemiology,JAN,2007,18,1,,,,,162,166,,10.1097/01.ede.0000248480.19983.ba,,,5,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",116XI,WOS:000242836700023,17179761,,,,2021-08-07,

We support recent calls for environmental epidemiologists to play a more active role in furthering the global agenda for sustainability, environmental health and equity. We further suggest that the discipline of environmental epidemiology, as well as relevant funding agencies, broaden their focus to include rigorous research on the upstream, larger-scale societal factors that contribute to inequitable patterns of exposure and health outcomes. By widening the scope of our vision and increasing the strength and breadth of the evidence base about how poverty and environment together affect health, we can better participate in efforts to promote social justice and responsible use and protection of the environment, and thus reduce health inequities.

The article concludes that the outcome of the Bali meeting is insufficient when compared to the nature of the challenge posed by climate change. However, it can nevertheless be considered a success in terms of 'Realpolitik' in paving the way for the negotiations ahead, because some real changes have been discerned in the political landscape. The challenges for the road towards Copenhagen are manifold: the sheer volume and complexity of the issues and the far-reaching nature of decisions such as differentiation between non-Annex I countries pose significant challenges in themselves, while the dependency on the electoral process in the USA introduces a high element of risk into the whole process. The emergence of social justice as an issue turns climate policy into an endeavour to improve the world at large - thereby adding to the complexity. And, finally, the biggest challenge is the recognition that the climate problem requires a global solution, that Annex I and non-Annex I countries are mutually dependent on each other and that only cooperation regarding technology in combination with significant financial support will provide the chance to successfully tackle climate change.","[Ott, Hermann E.; Sterk, Wolfgang; Watanabe, Rie] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, D-42004 Wuppertal, Germany","Ott, HE (corresponding author), Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, POB 10 04 80, D-42004 Wuppertal, Germany.",hermann.ott@wupperinst.org,,,,,,4,52,53,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

This coalitional politics articulates environmental and feminist concerns and rejects the limitations of a narrow-focused politics in favour of a more strategic, relational vision of social and environmental change. Framed by the Marxist-feminist concept of 'social reproduction', the analysis addresses the complex ways that globalised capitalism has transformed state and corporate responsibilities for social reproduction. The neoliberal policies of privatisation and deregulation have eroded the assurance of a liveable wage, affordable healthcare, decent education, breathable air, and clean water. Drawing on several examples from grassroots movements and community-based organisations, the essay discusses how diverse women activists conceptually link environmental justice and reproductive rights issues in their communities' struggles to sustain everyday life (or, to accomplish 'social reproduction'). The innovative coalition politics of organisations such as Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice and the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Coalition are generating dynamic 'living environmentalisms' with enough political vision and community 'groundedness' to build broadly-based social-environmental collaborations that stand a chance at compelling people to take stronger action to curb problems as big as global warming.","Mt Holyoke Coll, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA","Di Chiro, G (corresponding author), Mt Holyoke Coll, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA.",gdichiro@mtholyoke.edu,,,,,,81,99,99,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

The moral-philosophical task of developing principles of climate justice, or the issue of how the burdens (and benefits) of global climate change should be distributed between and within generations, is essential to climate ethics, but it is also insufficient. Climate ethics should avoid focusing too exclusively on '(technical-)ethical' discourse, but also incorporate insights from 'narrative', 'policy', and 'prophetic' discourses about or relevant to climate change politics. Climate ethics is to be conceived as pluralist: broad and interdisciplinary, but presumably conflictual and tragic as well.","Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands","Kamminga, MR (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",m.r.kamminga@rug.nl,,,,,,55,10,10,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

From the perspective of social justice (as a particular expression of the wider concept of human rights), however, several arguments can be advanced regarding public intervention in coastal defence management when private property is threatened by coastal erosion. In this paper we examine these arguments at both the short-term local scale and the long-term large spatial scale and consider the merits of inclusion of a social justice dimension in coastal erosion management. The coast provides a range of resources that benefit society as a whole. Coastal residents and property owners face a direct financial loss from coastal erosion but the general public also stands to incur losses other than purely financial if it there is public intervention for the benefit of these property owners. The arguments for public intervention are strongest at the local and short-term scales but they weaken (and even reverse) at geographically larger and longer time scales. At larger scales, the costs to society increase as intergenerational equity, non-coastal residents, climate and sea level change, and the environment are considered. Because of the intensity of interest involved at the local level, we argue that the necessary hard decisions must be made nationally if a sustainable policy is to be adopted. Social justice considerations provide a potential improvement on the traditional economic cost/benefit-based decision-making process of coastal erosion management but they only contribute to sustainability if viewed at the national level.

This paper explores how two elements of adaptive capacity-building that capacity and delivering adaptation actions-are likely to be constrained by wider social and economic factors affecting urban societies. Public open space in urban areas, although having a vital role to play under conditions of climate change, is already a contested policy area. Using the field of outdoor thermal comfort as an example of current adaptive behaviour, the paper reports on a study that examined the perceptions of thermal comfort of different users of public spaces in Manchester. It considers the implications of climate change scenarios for the ability to maintain thermal comfort in open spaces and examines the scope for physical intervention, such as through urban and built form design, to build adaptive capacity. However, it also explores possible scenarios of urban life under conditions of climate change and concludes that socio-economic determinants of access to and management of open space are likely to be of critical significance in delivering adaptation options, which are accessible to all and meet objectives of social justice.","[Wilson, Elizabeth; Nicol, Fergus; Nanayakkara, Leyon] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England","Wilson, E (corresponding author), Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Gipsy Lane, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",ebwilson@brookes.ac.uk,,,,,,47,21,22,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1523-908X,,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

Policy-makers and resource managers must now prepare for the impacts from climate change and support implementing such plans on the ground. In this paper we argue that climate change challenges the region to maintain its economic viability, but also holds some opportunities that may enhance economic development, human well-being, and social justice. To face these challenges and seize these opportunities effectively we must better understand adaptation capacities, opportunities and constraints, the social processes of adaptation, approaches for engaging critical players and the broader public in informed debate, decision-making, and conscious interventions in the adaptation process. This paper offers a preliminary qualitative assessment, in which we emphasize the need for (1) assessing the feasibility and side effects of technological adaptation options, (2) increasing available resources and improving equitable access to them, (3) increasing institutional flexibility, fit, cooperation and decision-making authority, (4) using and enhancing human and social capital, (5) improving access to insurance and other risk-spreading mechanisms, and (6) linking scientific information more effectively to decision-makers while engaging the public. Throughout, we explore these issues through illustrative sectoral examples. We conclude with a number of principles that may guide the preparation of future adaptation plans for the Northeast.","[Moser, Susanne C.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Inst Study Soc & Environm, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Kasperson, Roger E.] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Kasperson, Roger E.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Yohe, Gary] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT USA; [Agyeman, Julian] Tufts Univ, Dept Urban & Environm Policy & Planning, Medford, MA 02155 USA","Moser, SC (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Inst Study Soc & Environm, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",smoser@ucar.edu; rkasperson@clarku.edu; gyohe@wesleyan.edu; julian.agyeman@tufts.edu,,,,,,69,36,36,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Nonetheless, studies of media representations of climate change in the UK to date have focused on broadsheet newspapers. Moreover, readership patterns correlate with socio-economic status; the majority of readers of tabloids are in 'working class' demographics. With a growing need to engage wider constituencies in awareness and potential behavioral change, it is important to examine how these influential sources represent climate change for a heretofore understudied segment of citizenry. This paper links political geographies with cultural issues of identity and discourse, through claims and frames on climate change in four daily 'working class' tabloid newspapers in UK - The Sun (and News of the World), Daily Mail (and Mail on Sunday), the Daily Express (and Sunday Express), and the Mirror (and Sunday Mirror). Through triangulated Critical Discourse Analysis, investigations of framing and semi-structured interviews, this project examines representations of climate change in these newspapers from 2000 through 2006. Data show that news articles on climate change were predominantly framed through weather events, charismatic megafauna and the movements of political actors and rhetoric, while few stories focused on climate justice and risk. In addition, headlines with tones of fear, misery and doom were most prevalent. These analyses then enable discussions of how these representations may influence ongoing climate science and governance interactions as well as political geographies, and (re)shape the contemporary cultural politics of climate change discourse.

Like many liberal theories of justice, Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach does not adequately address this question. The author argues that the capabilities approach should be extended to account for the environment's instrumental value to human capabilities. Given this instrumental value, protecting capabilities requires establishing certain environmental conditions as an independent meta-capability. When combined with Nussbaum's nonprocedural method of political justification, this extension provides the basis for adjudicating environmental justice claims.

With reference to the case study of Waihi, the author argues that community resistance to managed retreat is an indicator of the complexity of the political challenges that underpin climate change problems.

More recently age and gender differences in cardiac mortality and to a lesser extent morbidity have been presented. To date spatial differences between the seasonal patterns of cardiac disease has not been presented. Literature relating to seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the southern hemisphere and in Australia in particular is scarce. The aim of this paper is to describe the seasonal, age, gender, and spatial patterns of cardiac disease in Melbourne Australia by using acute myocardial infarction admissions to hospital as a marker of cardiac disease. Results: There were 33,165 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) admissions over 2186 consecutive days. There is a seasonal pattern in AMI admissions with increased rates during the colder months. The peak month is July. The admissions rate is greater for males than for females, although this difference decreases with advancing age. The maximal AMI season for males extends from April to November. The difference between months of peak and minimum admissions was 33.7%. Increased female AMI admissions occur from May to November, with a variation between peak and minimum of 23.1%. Maps of seasonal AMI admissions demonstrate spatial differences. Analysis using Global and Local Moran's I showed increased spatial clustering during the warmer months. The Bivariate Moran's I statistic indicated a weaker relationship between AMI and age during the warmer months. Conclusion: There are two distinct seasons with increased admissions during the colder part of the year. Males present a stronger seasonal pattern than females. There are spatial differences in AMI admissions throughout the year that cannot be explained by the age structure of the population. The seasonal difference in AMI admissions warrants further investigation. This includes detailing the prevalence of cardiac disease in the community and examining issues of social and environmental justice.","[Loughnan, Margaret E.; Nicholls, Neville; Tapper, Nigel J.] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Loughnan, ME (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",margaret.loughnan@arts.monash.edu.au; neville.nicholls@arts.monash.edu.au; nigel.tapper@arts.monash.edu.au,"Nicholls, Neville/A-1240-2008","Tapper, Nigel/0000-0002-3207-9978; Nicholls, Neville/0000-0002-1298-4356",,,,54,55,56,0,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1476-072X,,,INT J HEALTH GEOGR,Int.

Rejecting the prophetic method of Romero, be pursued a low-key, pragmatic path in his attempt to end the Salvadoran civil war and bring justice to the poor masses. Throughout the 1980s, Rivera labored to create peace negotiations between the Salvadoran power structure and the FMLN-TDR opposition. Previously, as an auxiliary he was the driving force behind the efforts of Archbishop Luis Chavez to incorporate the social justice concepts of Vatican II and the Latin American Bishops' Conference at Medellin into Salvadoran society.

Using an experimental design embedded in two parallel survey questionnaires, one mailed to residents of Washington State, the other to German-speaking residents of Switzerland, we either manipulated or constructed three factors, issue importance (high/low), procedural fairness (fair/unfair), and policy outcome (risk averse/risk accepting). This design enabled us to compare the predictions of the standard account of procedural fairness, that trust and cooperation are determined by judgments of fairness, with the predictions of an alternative account, that trust and cooperation will be determined by judgments of procedural fairness only when the issue involved is not morally important. Results for the American case showed that under conditions of high issue importance, policy outcome affected judged fairness, trust, and cooperation. Under conditions of low issue importance, policy outcome had no effect on judged fairness or trust but did have a moderate impact on cooperation. Analyses also showed that when issue importance was high, procedural fairness had no effects. When issue importance was low, procedural fairness had moderate effects on judged fairness and trust. Results for the Swiss case replicated the main findings for the American case. Together, these results support the alternative model of the relation between trust and fairness, suggesting that the efficacy of fair procedures is strictly limited.","[Earle, Timothy C.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Siegrist, Michael] ETH, IED, Zurich, Switzerland","Earle, TC (corresponding author), Western Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",timearle@cc.wwu.edu,"Siegrist, Michael/A-1032-2008","Siegrist, Michael/0000-0002-6139-7190",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0323451],This study was supported by National Science Foundation Grant SES-0323451.,,94,49,51,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,OCT,2008,28,5,,,,,1395,1413,,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01091.x,,,19,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",350OT,WOS:000259363300017,18631299,,,,2021-08-07,

These gaps are rooted as much in limited conceptual development as they are in a lack of empirical research. Methods: In this conceptual article, the authors compare and contrast the evolution of climate change and AIDS research. They demonstrate how scholarship and response in these two seemingly disparate areas share certain important similarities, such as the globalization of discourses and associated masking of uneven vulnerabilities, the tendency toward techno-fixes, and the polarization of debates within these fields. They also examine key divergences, noting in particular that climate change research has tended to be more forward-looking and longer-term in focus than AIDS scholarship. Conclusion: Suggesting that AIDS scholars can learn from these key parallels and divergences, the paper offers four directions for advancing AIDS research: (1) focusing more on the differentiation of risk and responsibility within and among AIDS epidemics; (2) taking (back) on board social justice approaches; (3) moving beyond polarized debates; and (4) shifting focus from reactive to forward-looking and proactive approaches.","[Chazan, May; Brklacich, Michael] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Chazan, May; Whiteside, Alan] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Hlth Econ & HIV AIDS Res Div, Durban, South Africa","Chazan, M (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Loeb B 349,Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",mchazan@hotmail.com; michael_brklacich@carleton.ca; whitesid@ukzn.ac.za,,"Brklacich, Mike/0000-0003-4416-4472",Carleton University; University of KwaZulu-Natal; DFID Addressing the Balance of Burden of AIDS Research Partners Consortium,"MC wishes to acknowledge the PE Trudeau Foundation and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, MB acknowledges the support of Carleton University, and AW acknowledges the support of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and the DFID Addressing the Balance of Burden of AIDS Research Partners Consortium for support during the preparation of this manuscript.

Two questions are addressed in this paper: (1) which actors (human), actants (non-human) and networks have been and are shaping the CC narrative? (2) Who could be the appropriate leaders and leadership models to address the challenges associated with CC in our times? Powerful scientific, political and economic groupings spearheading the CC agenda have emerged. To this end, co-leadership might be an appropriate model for addressing CC in this century. A co-leadership model recognizes the existence and interface of leaders and co-leaders. In CC co-leadership places this narrative at the centre, driving various kinds of leaders and co-leaders as well as leadership and co-leadership tied to numerous CC leadership zones. Among some of the leadership zones are mitigation, adaptation, financing, technology, social dynamics, and policy framework. The entire work is informed by an analytical framework that permits documentation, understanding and tracing of actors, actants and networks, thus, the Actor/Actant Network Theory.","Univ S Africa, Exxaro Chair Business & Climate Change, Ctr Corp Citizenship, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa","Nhamo, G (corresponding author), Univ S Africa, Exxaro Chair Business & Climate Change, Ctr Corp Citizenship, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",nhamog@unisa.ac.za,"Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015","Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168",,,,41,8,8,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0258-9346,1470-1014,,POLITIKON-UK,Politikon,,2009,36,3,,,,,463,480,,10.1080/02589341003600247,,,18,Political Science,Government & Law,698PF,WOS:000285605000007,,Green Submitted,,,2021-08-07,

However, attempts to transfer the resulting proposals into an environmentally sensitive reality with a human face have not borne the fruit expected of them. The scenes one sees in today's globalised world only highlight the vast differences between north and south, which speak of the failure of policies to wipe out hunger and build a lasting peace. The countries and groups which control economy have imposed upon us all an asymmetrical, tremendously unfair type of globalisation that has thrust the world deep into crisis. While it is dangerous for a system based on equality to forget freedom, it is no less dangerous for a system based on freedom to forget equality and justice. Development is a human right and an ethical imperative. However, population should participate in the social processes involved as well as in the handling of environmental problems. Our models' lack of sustainability leaps to the eye once we realize that, together with the inconvenient truth about climate change presented by Al Gore, we also have among us another and even more inconvenient truth, that of the way people live, the truth that a large part of the world's population has to strive to survive under truly adverse conditions. It was a mistake to have swapped democratic values like social justice, equality and solidarity for the laws of the market, Mending that mistake will require a course change and an urgent decision to fly to the rescue. The time has come for citizen participation, which could change the crisis into a great opportunity. Education undoubtedly plays an important part in this process by contributing to the essential transition of people from their implicit or explicit role as subjects to that of participative citizens.","Fdn Cultura Paz, Madrid 28001, Spain","Zaragoza, FM (corresponding author), Fdn Cultura Paz, C Velazquez 14,3 Dcha, Madrid 28001, Spain.",fmayor@fund-culturadepaz.org,,,,,,13,16,16,0,8,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

It argues that environmental justice approaches can incorporate values into law-policy processes based upon vital aspects of the integrity and functioning of communities, distributional fairness, and capacities for wider engagement and participation in the search for necessary behavioural change. The conclusion is that the ultimate success of the urgent process of addressing climate-related threats, through a meaningful degree of mitigation and adaptation, and multiple levels of decision-making and response, must be informed by the precepts of environmental justice.","Swansea Univ, Sch Law, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales","Stallworthy, M (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Sch Law, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",m.stallworthy@swansea.ac.uk,,,,,,37,13,13,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0263-323X,1467-6478,,J LAW SOC,J.

If biofuels want to be part of the solution they must accept a degree of scrutiny unprecedented in the development of a new industry. That is because sustainability deals explicitly with the role of biofuels in ensuring the well-being of our planet, our economy, and our society both today and in the future. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been the standard framework for assessing sustainability of biofuels. These assessments show that corn ethanol has a marginally lower fossil energy and greenhouse gas footprint compared to petroleum fuel. Sugarcane ethanol and some forms of biodiesel offer substantially lower footprints. New biofuels may offer low footprints. The science of LCA is being stretched to its limits as policy makers consider direct and indirect effects of biofuels on global land and water resources, global ecosystems, air quality, public health, and social justice.","Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Sheehan, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, 325 Votech Bldg,1945 Buford St, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",sheeh179@umn.edu,"Sheehan, John/O-7042-2014",,,,,78,52,52,1,75,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0958-1669,1879-0429,,CURR OPIN BIOTECH,Curr.

These findings have begun to influence efforts to negotiate a 'post-Kyoto' global climate regime. Since the extraction of resources and energy is one of the most damaging stages of the chain of commodity production, a logical next step is the mounting cry from developing countries that they are owed an 'ecological debt' by the North. The G-77 and China have seized on these ideas and a movement for 'climate justice' is now gaining strength in and exerting influence in international negotiations, including the UNFCCC meetings in Delhi, Bali, and PoznaA. This article reviews the history of these related three ideas and examines their potential to reshape the discussion of 'burden sharing' in the post-Kyoto world where development is constrained by climate change.","[Roberts, J.

In response a re-positioning of the critical tradition in the scholarship and practice of social work has been proffered by several authors (for example, Allan et al., 2003; Dominelli, 2002) as a means of addressing and counteracting the more negative challenges facing social work emanating from these changes. We argue that this critical re-positioning can also be applied to similar challenges facing practice supervision. Findings: As the social work landscape has to contend with a more conservative and fiscally restrictive environment, so too has practice supervision become more focused on efficiency, accountability and worker performance often at the expense of professional and practice development. In addition, current research has identified a crisis in the probity of practice supervision where many practitioners cite disillusionment and despair, as well as lack of opportunity to stop and critically reflect on practice situations as another challenge in this changed climate. Application: As a significant site of practice, a critically informed supervision praxis has the potential to emerge as a site for modelling social change strategies associated with the critical social work tradition.","[Noble, Carolyn] Victoria Univ, Sch Social Sci STA, Social Work Unit, Melbourne, Vic 3006, Australia; [Irwin, Jude] Univ Sydney, Social Work Program, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Irwin, Jude] Univ Sydney, Policy Studies Program, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Noble, C (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Sch Social Sci STA, Social Work Unit, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 3006, Australia.",carolyn.noble@vu.edu.au,,,,,,40,91,91,4,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1468-0173,,,J SOC WORK,J.

An internationally administrated fund with UN participation will be created and invested exclusively in conservation, renewable energy and social development. The proposal has already received significant support from international institutions, European governments, NGOs and personalities worldwide. Ecuador, a less developed country in South America, remains dependent of petroleum exports, which have not led to economic growth and diversification, did not reduce poverty and inequality, and had strong environmental impacts. Given the limits of petroleum reserves, the Yasuni-ITT initiative opens alternatives towards sustainable development in the country, allowing a transition towards a post-petroleum society, and promoting ways towards human development within the limits of biodiversity conservation. This proposal, which can be replicated by other developing countries with fossil fuel reserves in biodiverse areas, opens new alternatives for post-Kyoto negotiations with binding commitments for several developing countries, and simultaneously addresses global warming, biodiversity loss, and poverty. In addition, it addresses national and international environmental justice. The article summarizes the proposal within the post-Kyoto context, and discusses relevant topics, such as its significance for Ecuador's development performance and future, as well as national and international environmental justice.

It argues that we need responsible global leaders who are aware of the pressing problems in the world, care for the needs of others, aspire to make this world a better place, and act in word and deed as global and responsible citizens. The argument is structured as follows: first, in highlighting some leadership challenges we discuss why it takes a responsible, global, and ultimately cosmopolitan mindset to enhance human values on a global scale. Second, we define more specifically responsible global leadership and the (potential) role of business leaders acting as agents of world benefit. Third, drawing on latest research on cosmopolitanism, we discuss the hallmarks of contemporary cosmopolitanism.

Particularly in the United States, the public discussion of these dimensions is strongly influenced by religious groups and leaders. Over the past few years, many religious groups have taken positions on climate change, highlighting its ethical dimensions. This paper aims to explore these ethical dimensions in the US public debate in relation to public support for climate policies. It analyzes in particular the Christian voices in the US public debate on climate change by typifying the various discourses. Three narratives emerge from this analysis: 'conservational stewardship' (conserving the 'garden of God' as it was created), 'developmental stewardship' (turning the wilderness into a garden as it should become) and 'developmental preservation' (God's creation is good and changing; progress and preservation should be combined). The different narratives address fundamental ethical questions, dealing with stewardship and social justice, and they provide proxies for public perception of climate change in the US. Policy strategies that pay careful attention to the effects of climate change and climate policy on the poor - in developing nations and the US itself - may find support among the US population. Religious framings of climate change resonate with the electorates of both progressive and conservative politicians and could serve as bridging devices for bipartisan climate-policy initiatives.

What has to be done and what has to change to avoid the worst-case consequences of global warming? These questions are debated in the six contributions which follow. This introduction to the debate sets the stage and puts the often widely diverging views in context, distinguishing two axes of debate. The first axis ('market vs. regulation') measures faith in the invisible hand to adjust the natural thermostat. The second axis expresses differences in views on the efficiency and equity implications of climate action. While the contributions do differ along these axes, most authors agree that capitalism's institutions need to be drastically reformed and made fundamentally more equitable. This means a much broader agenda for the climate movement (going beyond carbon trading and technocratic discussion of mitigation options). What is needed for climate stability is a systemic transformation based on growth scepticism, a planned transition to a non-fossil fuel economy, democratic reform, climate justice, and changed global knowledge and corporate and financial power structures.","Delft Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Fac TBM, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands","Storm, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Fac TBM, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",S.T.H.Storm@tudelft.nl,,,,,,93,41,41,0,33,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-155X,,,DEV CHANGE,Dev.

Following an overview of key issues and concerns within recent urban research relevant to human security, we draw attention to appropriate conceptual frameworks and methodological tools for understanding risk and vulnerability in the context of acute inequalities, poverty and the unsustainability of contemporary urbanism. This requires a combination of political, ecological and sustainable livelihoods analysis, linked to agendas of social and environmental justice. Key urban challenges for human security in the context of GEC relate to overall ecological footprints, maintaining institutional and infrastructural integrity, and safeguarding shelter, utilities, economic activities and livelihoods. These take on somewhat different complexions in coastal and inland urban areas. Although in wealthier parts of the world urbanization has generally stabilized or declined, it continues to increase in many poorer regions as a result of complex forces and processes. These increasingly include mobility to escape rural impoverishment and hunger through the adverse effects of GEC on rural livelihoods. The challenge of providing for large in-migrant populations in expanding cities with inadequate resourcing, while at the same time seeking to mitigate and adapt to the effects of GEC, is likely to create threats to political stability and human security in many contexts.","[Simon, David; Leck, Hayley] Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Simon, D (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",d.simon@rhul.ac.uk,,"Simon, David/0000-0002-3164-4138",,,,59,16,16,1,28,EARTHSCAN,LONDON,"14A ST CROSS STREET, LONDON, EC1N 8XA, ENGLAND",1756-5529,,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

J,"Outka, U",,,,"Outka, Uma",,,Siting Renewable Energy: Land Use and Regulatory Context,ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,"This Article takes up the increasingly important land use question of siting for renewable energy. As concern over climate change grows, new policies are being crafted at all levels of government to support renewable energy as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These policies are driving the need to site and construct new power plants that will utilize renewable resources. Historically, power plant siting has been the province of state and local governments, so the regulatory context into which renewables are being integrated varies, sometimes significantly, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. To examine this regulatory context, this Article focuses on Florida, a state which consumes the third-most electricity in the United States but Which generates less than 2 percent of that electricity from renewable resources. The Article first provides an overview of Florida's power supply sector and sets out the existing regulatory context for terrestrial siting of energy facilities. It then situates Florida's most promising renewable resources within that context, identifies regulatory barriers that implicate siting, and considers the siting issues unique to each resource. As the article explains, we now have a window of opportunity in which state and local governments can plan for and guide renewable energy siting an approach that contrasts with utility-driven planning and siting that has long been standard practice.","[Outka, Uma] Florida State Univ, IESES, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Outka, U (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coll Law, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",uoutka@law.fsu.edu,,"Outka, Uma/0000-0002-5270-6473",,,,184,10,10,0,6,UNIV CALIFORNIA  BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0046-1121,,,ECOL LAW QUART,Ecol.

Elaborating on one possible element of a successful human response, this paper looks at how participatory governance is treated in the literatures on social justice and climate change. This paper applies the works of Habermas and Foucault, as well as recent work from the fields of urban and environmental planning, to clarify how the balance between structure, power, and agency influences attempts to address social inequality and climate change. Applying this general framework to a case study of Durban, South Africa, the paper then discusses the effectiveness of participatory structures in practice. This case study provides a productive space to study the intersection of social and environmental concerns. It also allows us to explore how interactions between formal and informal participation expose the limits both of confrontational (Foucauldian) and of consensus-based (Habermassian) approaches to governance.

The specific dynamics of alliance building, political strategies and impacts of palm oil activism are shaped by the key role of the Indonesian environmental and agrarian justice movement, the broadening and radicalisation of groups in Europe and the ways in which these are interconnected by transnational activists. Campaigning has been successful in creating a transnational political debate around palm oil and biofuels and in influencing public opinion in Europe. Peasant activists have played an important role by combining issues of biodiversity and climate change with food sovereignty and by embedding the critique of biofuels within the global movement for climate justice. However, discontented palm oil smallholders and plantation workers are conspicuously absent at the transnational level. Building alliances between agrarian movements and plantation workers could strengthen the movement against biofuels by tapping into the potential offered by the transnational social and economic spaces which characterise the palm oil industry.","Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany","Pye, O (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,82,53,54,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-6150,1743-9361,,J PEASANT STUD,J.

Despite efforts by many industry leaders to frame climate change in jobs versus environment terms, the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP) has supported ambitious greenhouse gas reduction policies. Using interviews with union members and staff, this study examines CEP's climate change framing. It finds that CEP extended the environmental justice master frame to define its response to climate change, neutralize anti-Kyoto rhetoric, and work with the environmental movement. CEP's framing was accomplished through negotiation processes that continue to unfold as members work out the union's positions relative to their own values, experiences, and interpretations of what is possible. These findings suggest sustainability can be understood as an emergent, localized, and contested social order, and point to self-negotiation in longer-term social change struggles as a potential area of further study.","Canadian Ctr Policy Alternat, Vancouver, BC V6B 1H7, Canada","Daub, SJ (corresponding author), Canadian Ctr Policy Alternat, 1400-207 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1H7, Canada.",shannon@policyalternatives.ca,,,,,,56,7,8,1,16,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0195-6086,,,SYMB INTERACT,Symb.

A reoccurring theme from these schools and from the literature on school change is that exemplary leadership helps create the necessity for change and helps make the realities of change happen. More specifically, leaders at these schools where students traditionally marginalized are thriving come to administration with a commitment, or larger call, to focus their leadership on issues of equity and justice. Purpose: Scholars and administrators alike have called for constructive models of this kind of leadership. This article provides examples of these accomplishments in practice. It also provides insight into the realities of leading for social justice by revealing what principals sought to accomplish and how they approached that work. Participants: This article focuses on 6 principals-2 elementary, 2 middle, and 2 high school-who (1) led a public school, (2) possessed a belief that promoting social justice is a driving force behind what brought them to their leadership position, (3) advocated, led, and kept at the center of their practice/vision issues of race, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, and/or other historically marginalizing conditions, and (4) had evidence to show that their work has produced a more just school. Research Design: The qualitative study in which these analyses are grounded used a positioned subject approach. The method of data collection took place over one school year and included in-depth interviews with the principals, a review of documents and materials, site visits, discussions/interviews with school staff, a detailed field log, and a group meeting of the principal participants. This article is a focused discussion of aspects of a larger study, using the principals' voices to illustrate key themes. Findings: These leaders narrate the strategies they used to disrupt four kinds of school injustice: (1) school structures that marginalize, segregate, and impede achievement, such as pullout programs; (2) a deprofessionalized teaching staff who could benefit from focused staff development; (3) a school climate that needed to be more welcoming to marginalized families and the community; and (4) disparate student achievement levels. Recommendations: A series of lessons emerged from this research: that social justice in schools is more than rhetoric-indeed, it can be achieved; that inclusive schooling is a necessary and enriching component to enacting justice; that increasing staff capacity is essential to carry out a comprehensive agenda focused on equity; and that creating a climate that deeply values racial, cultural, and economic diversity is a key strategy to enacting justice.","Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Theoharis, G (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",,,,,,,59,45,48,0,12,TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV,NEW YORK,"525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

This concurs with recent themes in complexity studies. Data from ice cores indicates that major shifts in global climate regimes have occurred in as little as a decade, and that for most of the span of human existence the climate has oscillated much more violently than it has over the last 10,000 years. This evidence presents enormous challenges for international climate change negotiation and regulation, which has thus far focused on gradual change. It is argued that existing social theoretic engagements with physical agency are insufficiently geared towards dissonant or disastrous physical events. Wagering on the past and future importance of abrupt climate change, the article explores a way of engaging with catastrophic climatic change that stresses the inherent volatility and unpredictability of earth process, and the no-less-inherent vulnerability of the human body. Drawing on Bataille and Derrida, it proposes a way of nestling the issue of environmental justice within a broader sense of immeasurable indebtedness to those humans who endured previous episodes of abrupt climate change, and considers the idea of experimentation and generosity without reserve.","Open Univ, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland","Clark, N (corresponding author), Open Univ, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",n.h.clark@open.ac.uk,,"Clark, Nigel/0000-0002-6666-1739",,,,77,36,36,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-2764,1460-3616,,THEOR CULT SOC,Theory Cult.

To address this question, we revisit and seek to integrate insights from several disparate theories, including structuralism ( new and old), world systems theory, rational choice institutionalism, and social constructivism. We argue that the lack of convergence on climate grew almost inevitably from our starkly unequal world, which has created and perpetuated highly divergent ways of thinking (worldviews and causal beliefs) and promoted particularistic notions of fairness ( principled beliefs). We attempt to integrate structural insights about global inequality with the micro-motives of rational choice institutionalism. The structuralist insight that 'unchecked inequality undermines cooperation' suggests climate negotiations must be broadened to include a range of seemingly unrelated development issues such as trade, investment, debt, and intellectual property rights agreements. We conclude by reviewing the work of some 'norm entrepreneurs' bringing justice issues into climate negotiations and explore how these insights might influence 'burden sharing' discussions in the post-Kyoto world, where development is constrained by climate change.","[Parks, Bradley C.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Parks, Bradley C.] Coll William & Mary, Inst Theory & Practice Int Relat, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Roberts, J.

Its regulation certainly is no ordinary policy initiative. No one should be surprised, therefore, that reaching principled choices about its substantive scope requires more than routine policy analysis. A purely political calculus will likely result in legislation that ignores urgent human needs while providing environmentally counterproductive subsidies to current polluters. Pending legislation to address carbon-emissions includes large subsidies for existing emitters. These subsidies make little sense economically or politically. Worse, they divert resources needed to address two crucial issues that the proposed legislation largely ignores: the impact of raising carbon costs on low-income people and the effects of the pending legislation on the massive structural federal deficit. A carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would substantially increase costs not only for transportation but also for food and housing. With poverty levels rising even before the current economic downturn, the consequences of these price increases could be dire. Even without the pending legislation, the structural deficit will require deflationary tax increases or spending cuts. Combining carbon regulation with these measures could do severe damage. Although few challenge their merits, these proposals may nonetheless fail if a consensus emerges that they are extraneous to climate change legislation. Overly complex legislation often bogs down, and we lack coherent normative principles for issue joinder in public policy debates. Such principles can be derived and can counsel how we address both low-income subsidies and deficit reduction as part of climate change legislation. Another challenge is finding efficient means to deliver subsidies without disrupting incentives to conserve. Energy companies are likely to divert proposed allocations for this purpose to writing off bad debt. Funding energy-assistance programs will similarly crowd out existing resources.

In this article, the author argues that the right to water should he recognized as a basic right in and of itself, not merely as a component of the right to development or to a healthy life. The right to water, described both substantively and procedurally, is an emergent right that uniquely connects present and future generations into a relationship of justice involving reciprocity. As such, the human right to water needs to be not only a part of international politics and law, but must also percolate down to the local level in specific policy decisions regarding land use, zoning, and development. It is time for human rights to return to those small places, close to home where Eleanor Roosevelt famously claimed that they invariably originate. A primary example is the local regulation of golf courses, especially in light of their profligate water usage. A golf course's impact on neighboring communities and, by implication, on a global water system is, therefore, a legitimate focus of human rights litigation and advocacy.","Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Hiskes, RP (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",,,,,,,19,9,9,0,14,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0275-0392,1085-794X,,HUM RIGHTS QUART,Hum.

Public nuisance litigation for climate change impacts is a new and growing field that could provide the legal and policy underpinnings to help secure a viable foundation for climate justice in the United States and internationally. By securing victories in the court system, these suits may succeed where the domestic environmental justice movement failed in seeking to merge environmental protection and human rights concerns into an actionable legal theory. This Article first examines the nature and scope of the climate change impacts that are affecting vulnerable populations throughout the world. It then traces the evolution of public nuisance claims for climate change impacts, discusses the Native Village of Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil Corp. case as a turning point in the evolution of these claims, and considers what obstacles remain on the path toward success for Kivalina and similar suits in the United States and abroad. The Kivalina case involves the right set of facts and legal theories to afford a remedy to victims who are disproportionately affected by climate change. Ultimately, the Kivalina litigation could help to institutionalize climate justice claims as part of the post-Kyoto Protocol framework by recognizing a private right to be free from climate change impacts that threaten the sustainability of vulnerable communities.","Florida A&M Univ, Coll Law, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA","Abate, RS (corresponding author), Florida A&M Univ, Coll Law, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.",,,,,,,59,23,23,0,12,UNIV WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF LAW,SEATTLE,"WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW 1100 NE CAMPUS PARKWAY 410 CONDON HALL, SEATTLE, WA 98105 USA",0043-0617,,,WASH LAW REV,Wash.

This review article examines recent policy debates and literature on distributive justice and the climate regime and highlights some areas of key research. The review indicates that while discussions on climate justice have gained ascendency within the international regime circle with noticeable impacts, a lot remains to be clarified about the status of justice concepts and how to best design polices that reconcile moral ideals and power politics. Hence, although the current regime performs well in terms of recognizing the need for and incorporating concepts of distributive justice between the rich and poor countries; it has not provided a basis to sufficiently upset the underlying forces and abiding structures of global inequality.

After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomorphology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical innovations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the landscape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing development of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomorphological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of climate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science - a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada","Church, M (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",mchurch@geog.ubc.ca,,,,,,114,70,75,1,86,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

This paper explores the politics of sustainability through the prism of three major issues. First, the carbon-labelling controversy is used to highlight the potential conflict between green campaigners (who extol the benefits of local food) and social justice campaigners (who support fairly traded food from afar). Second, school-food reform is used to demonstrate that local and global food, far from being mutually exclusive options, can both be part of the constitution of a sustainable food system if global food is framed in cosmopolitan terms. Third, the paper engages with the politics of care literature to explore a question that underlies the above issues, namely, how and why we care for others. It is argued that ethical consumerism, a key part of a progressive narrative of care, is not sufficient to counter the challenge of climate change-the greatest threat to ecological integrity and social justice.","Cardiff Univ, Sch City & Reg Planning, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales","Morgan, K (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch City & Reg Planning, Room 2-66,Glamorgan Bldg, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",,,,Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [not_applicable] Funding Source: researchfish,,,52,85,85,2,51,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

In the last three decades, neo-liberal and managerial ideologies have consistently favoured social policies that generate high levels of poverty, an anti-welfare political climate, punitive welfare reforms, periodic budgetary cutbacks and the subsequent decay of the social service sector. These processes impaired the capacity of many social services to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable constituencies. They also undermined the social workers' ability to fulfil some of their main social missions: promoting social change and pursuing social justice. The present article calls for social services for the poor to restore this fundamental social mission by adopting an anti-oppressive approach. The article is organised around three sections: first, it examines the relationship between poverty and oppression; second, it reviews the relevant literature on anti-oppressive organisations; and third, it lays down the theoretical and organisational principles of the development of anti-oppressive social services for the poor.","[Strier, Roni] Univ Haifa, Sch Social Work, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Binyamin, Sharon] Jerusalem Municipal, Welf Dept, Jerusalem, Israel","Strier, R (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Sch Social Work, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",rstrier@univ.haifa.ac.il,"Strier, Roni/ABG-3745-2020",,,,,101,37,37,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0045-3102,1468-263X,,BRIT J SOC WORK,Br.

First, in the introduction, the author discusses how early traditional urban sociologists and human ecologists variably expressed the human exemptionalism paradigm when examining urbanization. Then, in the body of the article, the author provides an overview of the struggle in environmental sociology to find connections between urbanization and the natural environment. The main focus is on how environmental sociologists have theorized the environmental impact of urbanization, although other relevant topics (e.g., environmental justice in the city) are briefly addressed. Through the course of the article, several principles are developed to help guide a future environmental sociology of urbanization. In the conclusion, the author cites research done by other social and natural scientists to further elaborate on these principles.","Univ Oregon, Dept Sociol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Clement, MT (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Sociol, 1291 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",mclemen2@uoregon.edu,,,,,,170,23,23,3,66,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1086-0266,1552-7417,,ORGAN ENVIRON,Organ.

To meet the expected demand for food without significant increases in prices, it has been estimated that we need to produce 70-100 per cent more food, in light of the growing impacts of climate change, concerns over energy security, regional dietary shifts and the Millennium Development target of halving world poverty and hunger by 2015. The goal for the agricultural sector is no longer simply to maximize productivity, but to optimize across a far more complex landscape of production, rural development, environmental, social justice and food consumption outcomes. However, there remain significant challenges to developing national and international policies that support the wide emergence of more sustainable forms of land use and efficient agricultural production. The lack of information flow between scientists, practitioners and policy makers is known to exacerbate the difficulties, despite increased emphasis upon evidence-based policy. In this paper, we seek to improve dialogue and understanding between agricultural research and policy by identifying the 100 most important questions for global agriculture. These have been compiled using a horizon-scanning approach with leading experts and representatives of major agricultural organizations worldwide. The aim is to use sound scientific evidence to inform decision making and guide policy makers in the future direction of agricultural research priorities and policy support. If addressed, we anticipate that these questions will have a significant impact on global agricultural practices worldwide, while improving the synergy between agricultural policy, practice and research.

This article reviews relevant studies and theories of social movements with special attention to the role of knowledge-making in social movements, before tracing the relations between social movements and climate change knowledge from the 1970s to the present. Climate change first emerged as an issue of public concern within the context of the environmental movements of the 1970s and 1980s, while skepticism was shaped, in significant ways, by the neo-conservative and neo-nationalist movements that grew to political significance in the 1980s and 1990s. The neo-liberal movements of the 1990s and 2000s have helped shape the recent rise to public attention of climate change as an overarching political problem. Finally, this article discusses how concerns with 'climate justice' have emerged as part of a social movement for global justice, and concludes by contrasting the different social movements that have affected and influenced the making of climate change knowledge.

There is a continuous struggle to allocate the earth's resources among users and uses. This article argues that distributional problems have two faces: access to basic resources or ecospace; and, the allocation of environmental resources, risks, burdens, and responsibilities for causing problems. Furthermore, addressing problems of access and allocation often requires access to social processes (science, movements and law). Analysts, however, have tended to take a narrow, disciplinary approach although an integrated conceptual approach may yield better answers. This article proposes a multi-disciplinary perspective to the problem of access and allocation and illustrates its application to water management and climate change.","[Gupta, Joyeeta] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand","Gupta, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",joyeeta.gupta@ivm.vu.nl,"Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013; Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418; Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660",,,,89,43,44,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It involves the participation of local communities in various forestry activities to achieve sustainable forestry, advance social justice and improve socioeconomic welfare, and promote a stable and healthy environment. This paper analyses the potential benefits of agroforestry farms in CBFM sites to mitigate climate change. The incorporation of trees in farms and landscapes has led to enhanced carbon storage and sequestration. Half a million hectares of agroforestry farms in CBFM sites in the Philippines are estimated to store 25 MtC while sequestering 2.7 MtC annually. Lessons are drawn from three carbon sequestration projects under development using CBFM as the main approach. Income from carbon credits is not sufficient to recover the cost of tree planting. The transaction costs of forestry CDM projects are substantial and could prove to be the greatest barrier to project fruition. Government institutions must find ways to encourage project developers by simplifying rules and regulations for forestry carbon projects. Forest definition must be assessed. Project developers and the government could also explore the voluntary carbon market which is more flexible than the CDM market. Policy and technical studies must be conducted to ascertain the potential of the REDD for CBFM sites in the country.","[Lasco, Rodel D.] IRRI, World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF Philippines, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Evangelista, Remedios S.] FMB, DENR, Quezon City, Philippines; [Pulhin, Florencia B.] UPLB, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, FDC, College Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines","Lasco, RD (corresponding author), IRRI, World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF Philippines, Laguna 4031, Philippines.",rlasco@cgiar.org,,"Lasco, Rodel/0000-0003-3675-4237",Alternative to Slash and Burn (ASB); IFADS,The authors would like to acknowledge that support provided by the Alternative to Slash and Burn (ASB) Program and the IFADS-funded Rewarding the Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project.

The objective of this research article is to explore aspects of the author's construction of climate justice with climate stakeholders and provide insight into how climate justice might ultimately be achieved within the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) context. This article reports results of a survey of attitudes and opinions respecting climate justice at Copenhagen and surrounding climate negotiations of the UNFCCC. Utilizing a definition of climate justice based on legal justice, distributive justice, participatory justice, and an ethical practice, respondents were surveyed in respect of their own attitudes and opinions surrounding the UNFCCC COP at Copenhagen and that of their country. Questions were posed surrounding the desired limits to global temperature, the optimal distribution of obligations for emission reduction targets amongst the global community, and the respondent's opinion of participation in negotiations.

It includes impact theories (IPAT and STIRPAT), the treadmill of production, growth machine theories, and resource extraction/ecologically unequal exchange theories. A second wave of theories focuses on environmental destruction and the social movements that challenge the agents of destruction. To accommodate popular unrest over environmental declines, states have typically created corporatist policymaking circles that include long-established, moderate environmental nongovernmental organizations and exclude disadvantaged and unorganized peoples. Advocates for environmental justice and sustainable consumption have attempted to mobilize the excluded, articulating a just sustainability theory that addresses both concerns. Current controversies in the field focus on the predictive power of first- and second-wave theories.

Yet little attention has been paid to the consequences of adaptation policies and practices for sustainability. Recognition that not every adaptation to climate change is a good one has drawn attention to the need for sustainable adaptation strategies and measures that contribute to social justice and environmental integrity. This article presents four normative principles to guide responses to climate change and illustrates the significance of the 'sustainable adaptation' concept through case studies from diverse contexts. The principles are: first, recognize the context for vulnerability, including multiple stressors; second, acknowledge that differing values and interests affect adaptation outcomes; third, integrate local knowledge into adaptation responses; and fourth, consider potential feedbacks between local and global processes. We argue that fundamental societal transformations are required in order to achieve sustainable development pathways and avoid adaptation funding going into efforts that exacerbate vulnerability and contribute to rising emissions. Despite numerous challenges involved in achieving such change, we suggest that sustainable adaptation practices have the potential to address some of the shortcomings of conventional social and economic development pathways.","[Eriksen, Siri] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Aldunce, Paulina] Univ Chile, Dept Environm Sci & Renewable Nat Resources, Santiago, Chile; [Aldunce, Paulina] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Bahinipati, Chandra Sekhar] MIDS, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India; [Martins, Rafael D'Almeida] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Ctr Environm Studies NEPAM, BR-13083867 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Molefe, John Isaac] Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, Gaborone, Botswana; [Nhemachena, Charles] CSIR, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [O'Brien, Karen; Sygna, Linda; Ulsrud, Kirsten] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Olorunfemi, Felix] Nigerian Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Park, Jacob] Green Mt Coll, Poultney, VT 05764 USA","Eriksen, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",siri.eriksen@umb.no,"BAHINIPATI, CHANDRA SEKHAR/H-8627-2019; Nhemachena, Charles/D-8489-2018","BAHINIPATI, CHANDRA SEKHAR/0000-0002-4013-8915; Nhemachena, Charles/0000-0002-4685-9246; Martins, Rafael/0000-0002-2937-6170",,,,66,262,266,10,120,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Exploring the case of contested carbon market designs in global climate governance, however, this article argues that performativity analysts have so far failed to pay sufficient attention to the political dimensions of marketization. Adopting insights from recent materialist approaches to the politics of techno-science, the article addresses this imbalance by outlining three modalities of techno-economic citizenship, as these interfere with the shaping of specific carbon market designs. Drawing on web-based research tools and document analysis, each modality is illustrated via transnational environmental NGO practices of contestation, particularly in the global South. The performativity programme, it is concluded, stands to gain from conceptualizing politics as dynamic assemblages of collective actors, sites of contestation and technologies of witnessing. Re-framing performativity in this direction allows for a reintegration of economics into a wider political ecology of contested eco-sciences.","Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark","Blok, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Aster Farimagsgade 5,Box 2099, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",abl@soc.ku.dk,,"Blok, Anders/0000-0002-3403-698X",,,,61,37,37,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Vulnerable populations-children, the elderly, and the poor-will be disproportionately affected. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed projected impacts of climate change on children's health, the pathways involved in these effects, and prevention strategies. DATA SOURCES: We assessed primary studies, review articles, and organizational reports. DATA SYNTHESIS: Climate change is increasing the global burden of disease and in the year 2000 was responsible for > 150,000 deaths worldwide. Of this disease burden, 88% fell upon children. Documented health effects include changing ranges of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue; increased diarrheal and respiratory disease; increased morbidity and mortality from extreme weather; changed exposures to toxic chemicals; worsened poverty; food and physical insecurity; and threats to human habitation. Heat-related health effects for which research is emerging include diminished school performance, increased rates of pregnancy complications, and renal effects. Stark variation in these outcomes is evident by geographic region and socioeconomic status, and these impacts will exacerbate health disparities. Prevention strategies to reduce health impacts of climate change include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation through multiple public health interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Further quantification of the effects of climate change on children's health is needed globally and also at regional and local levels through enhanced monitoring of children's environmental health and by tracking selected indicators. Climate change preparedness strategies need to be incorporated into public health programs.","[Sheffield, Perry E.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med & Pediat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Landrigan, Philip J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Childrens Environm Hlth Ctr, Dept Prevent Med, New York, NY 10029 USA","Sheffield, PE (corresponding author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med & Pediat, Box 1512,1 Gustave Levy Pl, New York, NY 10029 USA.",perry.sheffield@mssm.edu,,,National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5T32 HD049311]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [T32HD049311] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research is supported by the National Institutes of Health Research Training Program in Environmental Pediatrics (5T32 HD049311).,,122,156,160,2,139,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

Law can facilitate adaptation, using regulation to reduce exposure or sensitivity to climate hazards, establishing the legal architecture for new market mechanisms, and funding arrangements for adaptation costs and liability for climate impacts. It can also ensure the accountability of adaptation decision making and addressing some of the social justice dimensions of adaptation. Yet there are also characteristics of legal institutions, processes, and principles that may impede adaptation, including by creating compensable property rights that hinder new regulation. There are several characteristics of climate change and associated impacts that will make law-making for adaptation uniquely challenging. These include high levels of cascading uncertainty, irreversibility, the context-specificity of impacts, the long delay between emissions and impacts, and the interaction between climate change impacts and other environmental, social, and economic stressors. Laws dealing with substantive climate impacts may be appropriate and necessary in some cases, but the broader challenge for law-makers is to make legal processes and instruments more adaptive and responsive to change itself.

This article describes three classes of psychological impacts: direct (e.g., acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment); indirect (e.g., threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks); and psychosocial (e.g., chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and postdisaster adjustment). Responses include providing psychological interventions in the wake of acute impacts and reducing the vulnerabilities contributing to their severity; promoting emotional resiliency and empowerment in the context of indirect impacts; and acting at systems and policy levels to address broad psychosocial impacts. The challenge of climate change calls for increased ecological literacy, a widened ethical responsibility, investigations into a range of psychological and social adaptations, and an allocation of resources and training to improve psychologists' competency in addressing climate change-related impacts.","[Doherty, Thomas J.] Lewis & Clark Grad Sch Educ & Counseling, Dept Counseling Psychol, Portland, OR 97208 USA; [Clayton, Susan] Coll Wooster, Dept Psychol, Wooster, OH USA","Doherty, TJ (corresponding author), Lewis & Clark Grad Sch Educ & Counseling, Dept Counseling Psychol, POB 3174, Portland, OR 97208 USA.",thomas@selfsustain.com,"Clayton, Susan/T-1364-2019",,,,,113,223,230,8,145,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0003-066X,1935-990X,,AM PSYCHOL,Am.

It analyses the Camp as a contested space where different emphases on environmental and social priorities have to be negotiated by its activists. The article considers areas of contestation where concerns over climate change meet questions of social justice. These are structured around tangible issues of campaigning, such as opposition to new coal-fired power stations or to the third runway at Heathrow airport, some of which have put the Camp at odds with labour movement and class struggle activists. While some demand a drastic shift away from current levels of consumption, others question the discriminatory effects of self-imposed austerity politics. On a more abstract level, the article considers debates on the need for government solutions to the environmental crisis and their possible impacts on social equality. The article is structured around movement-internal debates and makes use of interviews, extensive fieldwork notes and continuous participant observation over the course of four years.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Schlembach, R (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",r_schlembach@yahoo.com,,"Schlembach, Raphael/0000-0002-3153-0499",,,,45,27,27,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0261-0183,1461-703X,,CRIT SOC POLICY,Crit.

However, climate change mitigation policies are widely perceived to have regressive effects - that is, putting a higher financial burden as a proportion of household income on poor than on rich households. This is one of several major barriers to the adoption of effective mitigation policies. They would also have considerable social justice implications requiring significant welfare state responses. We assess the claim that climate change policies have regressive effects by comparing different types of mitigation policies. We will argue that many of these are indeed likely to have regressive distributional implications but that there are several policy options to counteract regressive effects.","[Buechs, Milena] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci Sociol & Social Policy, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Bardsley, Nicholas] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England; [Duwe, Sebastian] Free Univ Berlin, Environm Policy Res Ctr FFU, D-1000 Berlin, Germany","Buchs, M (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci Sociol & Social Policy, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",m.buechs@soton.ac.uk,"Buchs, Milena/AAU-2581-2021","Buchs, Milena/0000-0001-6304-3196",Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/H044086/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,63,43,43,3,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0261-0183,,,CRIT SOC POLICY,Crit.

These initiatives include local deliberative processes of low-carbon futures as well as local-global interactions in 'eco-innovation jam' dialogues carried out in a virtual space, but founded on communicating with local stakeholder groups. Experiences from national processes and international examples of these structured dialogues of community engagement raise important questions of environmental justice and deliberative processes that facilitate participation by some groups, but perhaps also neglect others. This is particularly relevant since the environmental justice discourse traditionally frames environmental concerns in a place-bound manner that includes local responses to environmental questions. In this paper we argue the importance of local and global forums and deliberative processes for community engagement in order to incorporate stakeholders' perceptions of future options for low-carbon living, travelling and consuming services and products. Important policy transformations in planning for low-carbon societies are outlined and results from cases are discussed. We conclude with three remarks about the importance of citizen participation for understanding local conditions for change, processes of localized internationalization, and new roles for nation states facing the climate change challenge. We also recognise the importance of the local and global level of deliberative processes targeting sustainable urban futures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This New World dis(Order) is characterized by insecurity of the United States in the face of economic and political decline vis-a-vis China; fragmentation of the Group of 77 developing nations negotiating bloc; and weakening of the European Union, which was cut out entirely from the group negotiating the Copenhagen Accord. In addition to old alignments of developing countries based on solidarity, negotiating blocs have fractured along lines of responsibility-for climate change, capability to address it, and national vulnerability to climate risks.

Here, we argue that there is potential for even more explicit bandwagoning in ways that will most directly benefit those who are suffering, and will continue to suffer, from climate change's greatest impacts. The human rights framework offers a guide to more effective climate action via two interconnected arenas: a legal arena that provides an established set of tools for climate activists, and a political arena that provides a normative underpinning for a range of judicial and non-judicial actions in support of 'climate justice'.

The analysis reveals that responses by leading international organisations continue to appeal to the precepts of neoclassical economy. We argue that from an ecological economics perspective, policy responses under the various labels of green economy, green growth, sustainable growth, green new deal, fall well short of what is needed to fight the environmental crisis and rising inequality across and within countries. The idea of justice and equity that underpins the mainstream approach seems inadequate in terms of sustaining our environmental base and global environmental justice. Based on this critical review, we propose an 'alternative turn', centred on three elements of a paradigm shift leading to a new economy where the environmental base and global environmental justice are at the centre of the discourse.

As part of a set of studies on climate change impacts to California, this paper analyzes the potential impacts from projected sea-level rise if no actions are taken to protect the coast (a no-adaptation scenario), focusing on impacts to the state's population and infrastructure. Heberger et al. (2009) also covered effects on wetlands, costs of coastal defenses, and social and environmental justice related to sea-level rise. We analyzed the effect of a medium-high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2 in IPCC 2000) and included updated projections of sea-level rise based on work by Rahmstorf (Science 315(5810): 368, 2007). Under this scenario, sea levels rise by 1.4 m by the year 2100, far exceeding historical observed water level increases. By the end of this century, coastal flooding would, under this scenario, threaten regions that currently are home to approximately 480,000 people and $100 billion worth of property. Among those especially vulnerable are large numbers of low-income people and communities of color. A wide range of critical infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals, schools, emergency facilities, wastewater treatment plants, and power plants will also be at risk. Sea-level rise will inevitably change the character of California's coast; practices and policies should be put in place to mitigate the potentially costly and life-threatening impacts of sea-level rise.","[Heberger, Matthew; Cooley, Heather; Herrera, Pablo; Gleick, Peter H.; Moore, Eli] Pacific Inst, Oakland, CA 94612 USA","Heberger, M (corresponding author), Pacific Inst, 654 13th St, Oakland, CA 94612 USA.",mheberger@pacinst.org; hcooley@pacinst.org; pt_herrera@gmail.com; pgleick@pacinst.org; emoore@pacinst.org,"Gleick, Peter/E-5528-2015","Gleick, Peter/0000-0001-7232-9284",California Energy Commission; Metropolitan Transportation Commission; California Ocean Protection Council,Major funds were provided by the California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) Program.

This climate policy was driven by a new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who had made addressing climate change his signature policy commitment both before and after the 2007 election that brought the Australian Labor Party to power. His climate policy was underpinned by two main interrelated narratives: ecological modernisation and climate justice. In this paper I consider the story of the Rudd government's climate policy experience through an ecological modernisation lens. In the end, it was the seeming disjuncture between political rhetoric and policy outcomes that brought the Rudd prime ministership down. The telling of the Rudd climate story through these narratives reveals some of the limitations of (mainstream) ecological modernisation as a major environmental management approach, as well as highlighting the vagaries of political leadership.","Griffith Univ, Dept Polit & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Curran, G (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Dept Polit & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",g.curran@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,65,24,24,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-774X,1472-3425,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

The purpose of this report is to consider how this broadening has influenced research topics and themes, the geographic locations of researchers, and the future course of environmental justice research. We searched for articles identifying environmental justice as a keyword from 2000 to 2009 in Scopus, Web of Science, and GeoBase. While the number of articles published looking at environmental justice has increased over the past decade, our search contradicts the previous claims that environmental justice research has greatly expanded conceptually or geographically beyond its traditional origins. Our findings show that environmental justice research remains firmly rooted in the United States, focusing on the distributional aspects of environmental harms.

We pay particular attention to the physical environment, while underscoring the inextricable links between physical and social environments, and particularly the need to link social and environmental justice. The paper begins with a brief orientation to three emerging threats to health equity, namely ecological degradation, climate change, and peak oil, and their connection to economic instability, food security, energy security and other key determinants of health. We then present three contrasting perspectives on the nature of social change and how change is catalyzed, arguing for an examination of the conditions under which cultural change on the scale required to realize the vision of 'supportive environments for all' might be catalyzed, and the contribution that health promotion as a field could play in this process. Drawing on sociological theory, and specifically practice theory and the work of Pierre Bourdieu, we advocate rethinking education for social change by attending more adequately to the social conditions of transformative learning and cultural change. We conclude with an explication of three key implications for health promotion practice: a more explicit alignment with those seeking to curtail environmental destruction and promote environmental justice, strengthening engagement with local or settings-focused 'communities of practice' (such as the Transition Town movement), and finding new ways to creatively 'engage emergence', a significant departure from the current dominant focus on 'risk management'.","[Poland, Blake] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Dooris, Mark] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Hlth & Postgrad Med, Healthy Settings Dev Unit, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Haluza-Delay, Randolph] Kings Univ Coll, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Poland, B (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",blake.poland@utoronto.ca,"Dooris, Mark T/F-9712-2011",,,,,157,35,37,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0957-4824,1460-2245,,HEALTH PROMOT INT,Health Promot.

It takes the example of current policies in the UK as its primary focus. Methodology/approach - A combination of literature, policy review and the quantitative and qualitative evidence gathered through primary fieldwork research from a number of related studies. Findings - It is identified that different social groups can experience very different outcomes in accessing transport and adapting to changes to the transport system, whether these are uniquely targeted towards certain individuals or more systemically applied across the whole population. For this reason, it is essential that policy makers fully understand the potential vulnerability and resilience of different social groups to policies that are intended to address transport-related climate change. The key component of social impacts should be systematically analyzed, by income, potential vulnerability and their spatial and temporal distribution, as well as according to resilience/adaptability to the proposed intervention. This continues to pose an important future challenge for research in this area of transport policy making.

Human use of the environmental goods give us an assumption that the Earth and its resources can have only instrumental value in our lives. In fact, there are really philosophical challenges here, especially when we think about future generations that will face the results of climate change, caused at present by fast growing green house gas emission. The problem can not be solved only by discounting future costs. It has much deeper, moral foundation. Using John Rawls' concept of justice as fairness, it can provide us a solid ground of philosophical perspective for building a proper social contract which considers the rights of future people, especially when we face political dilemma of tackling green house gas emission.","[Plachciak, Adam] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism, Wroclaw, Poland","Plachciak, A (corresponding author), St Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",adam.plachciak@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,30,0,0,0,17,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

It is also clear that demand for natural resources such as water and fossil fuels is problematic as access to water becomes highly competitive and carbon emissions becomes intense. It is evident that such challenges require a much better understanding of how the application of environmental ethics and considerations of the social justice can assist in resolving potential conflict. This chapter describes how social psychological theory and the understanding of lay ethics can provide a basis for sharing. The concepts of equity, distributive justice, procedural and interactive justice and fairness are introduced. The significance of these for resource allocation decisions is explained. Water resources management and climate change are used to provide examples.

This essay seeks to address this deficit by examining Looking Both Ways: Women's Lives at the Crossroads of Reproductive Justice and Climate Justice, a publication of Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice. The text employs the metaphor of looking both ways to argue that climate and reproductive justice agenda setting should be aligned to simultaneously mitigate climate change and advance women's reproductive freedom. I contend looking both ways offers an innovative epistemological framework for articulating the intersections of climate and reproductive justice, as well as a convincing rationale for cultivating cross-movement coalitions. However, my analysis suggests that the organization's call to align climate and reproductive justice should be embraced with the acknowledgment that looking both ways limits a comprehensive coalitional perspective. This essay enhances current understandings of climate and reproductive justice concerns and demonstrates why diverse stakeholders committed to environmental causes must also support reproductive freedom.","[de Onis, Kathleen M.] Univ Montana, Dept Commun Studies, Coll Technology, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Montana State Univ Bozeman, Bozeman, MT USA","de Onis, KM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Commun Studies, Coll Technology, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kathleen.deonis@mso.umt.edu,,,,,,52,16,16,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Four theoretical approaches (problem structuring; negotiation theory; collective action and social practice models; legal theory) are applied to the climate regime. A principled approach is only a distributive approach from a narrow short-term perspective. It becomes an integrative approach from a longer-term perspective when it increases the pie, enhances the win-win opportunities and creates space for sustainable solutions to emerge. It is especially integrative when undertaken within the context of global rule of law, which is able to create predictable rules that apply to future global problems with different country interests.

The study of such discourses requires an expansion to contexts outside developed countries, but within the influence of global forces, especially in how dominant global discourses influence national policy making. This article focuses on the competing discourses in the debate about the creation of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment as portrayed by the media and the actors involved in the process. The results show a debate dominated by neoliberal discourses of administrative rationalism and economic rationalism, intertwined with the environmental requirements of a free trade agreement between Peru and the USA. In this case, democratic and environmental justice concerns-from both indigenous rights and anti-hegemonic perspectives-were marginalized. The study presents the operationalization of theoretical categorizations of environmental discourses within the concepts of storylines and discourse coalitions.","[Takahashi, Bruno] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Takahashi, B (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, Dept Commun, 305 Comm Arts & Sci Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",btakahas@msu.edu; mark@environmentalcomm.org,,"Takahashi, BRUNO/0000-0002-8570-4925",,,,45,17,17,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1752-4032,,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

ASSESSING THE SUCCESS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT IN EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEMES",URBAN AREAS AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE,Research in Urban Sociology,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,Emissions trading; environmental justice; Regional Clean Air Incentive Market (RECLAIM); communities for a better environment; environmental policy; Southern California,,"Purpose - Emissions trading is often heralded as an efficient approach to environmental regulation. In the mid-90s Communities for a Better Environment (CBE), a Los Angeles-based advocacy organization, raised concerns that emissions trading in the South Coast Air Basin, the most polluted region in Southern California, would result in environmental injustice. The organizations concerns received mixed responses from regulators. Historical analysis is used to assess the clash between emissions trading and environmental justice (EJ). Methodology/approach - Emissions trading and EJ arose side by side between the 1960s and the 1990s, yet they disagree on how to clean the air. Historical analysis of legal documents, presidential addresses, letters, working papers, reports, and the like offers a better understanding of the development of emissions trading and EJ, and their intersection in environmental policy. Findings - Emissions trading was grafted onto Clean Air Act policies not inherently designed for their incorporation. As a result, emissions trading came into direct philosophical opposition with EJ as political pressures calling for both economically efficient antiregulatory-ism and environmental equity forced their intersection. Formally, regional and national government accepted EJ as part of law. However, in principle, emissions trading undermined this acceptance. As a result, CBE could not easily win or explicitly lose its battle against emissions trading. Originality/value of paper - Previous work on the relationship between emissions trading and EJ tend to focus on legal analysis and normative implications of emissions trading. Putting emissions trading and environment justice into historical perspective helps to illuminate larger questions about EJ activism and policy. Also, as California, the United States, and Europe turn to emissions trading to combat not only air pollution but also climate change, important lessons can be learned from the histories and collision of emissions trading and EJ.","Univ Calif San Diego, Hist Sci & Sci Studies Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Tribbett, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Hist Sci & Sci Studies Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,79,0,0,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1049-2585,,978-1-78190-036-9,RES URBAN SOCIOL,,,2012,12,,,,,,135,167,,10.1108/S1047-0042(2012)0000012009,,,33,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,BJL00,WOS:000328739400007,,,,,2021-08-07,

Master plans of cities can feature responses to these challenges, as in the case of Jakarta's master plan 2010-2030. However, as this chapter will argue, the top-down nature of planning would likely produce, reproduce, or reaffirm unjust urban geographies in the name of climate change adaptation. North Jakarta and its coastal area, which were prone to climate change risks, has been home for more than 40,000 poor households, most of which live in houses less than 50 m(2) in informal settlements with lack of basic needs infrastructures. This chapter addresses the question, How are poor communities in the north coast of Jakarta affected by extreme weather events, and how are their everyday experiences addressed in master plan Jakarta 2010-2030? Methodology/approach - Analysis is based on community profiles, census information, and a workshop with representatives of these communities. This chapter will also analyze relevant parts of Jakarta's 2010-2030 master plan. The discussion covers the following: (1) the making of place-based communities of the urban poor in the north coast of Jakarta compared to the master plan, and (2) the impact of climate change on the urban poor's livelihoods in the north coast. Findings - The current master plan 2010-2030 features plans to mitigate climate change and environmental risks for the coastal area, especially sea level rise, land subsidence, and pollution. The study reveals that North Jakarta communities were unaware of what the city planners have drafted, but most of them realized climate challenges based on their everyday experience. They aspired to be involved in the planning process, but their informal status hampered their opportunity to be heard. Originality/value of chapter - Rather than looking at how Jakarta as a city is affected by climate change, this chapter focuses on specific communities in North Jakarta that are prone to climate change-induced risks. Climate change impacts are spatially unequal, and even in the same region that theoretically bears the same risks, the impact distribution of climate change can be unequal for different social groups. The chapter also questions the ability of urban planning to respond to these challenges when planning practice itself has not yet taken into account citizens' social awareness and participation meaningfully.","Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Inst Water Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Padawangi, R (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Inst Water Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,,,,,,27,12,12,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1049-2585,,978-1-78190-036-9,RES URBAN SOCIOL,,,2012,12,,,,,,321,339,,10.1108/S1047-0042(2012)0000012016,,,19,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,BJL00,WOS:000328739400014,,,,,2021-08-07,

Their analysis is based on responses to open-ended questions completed by 1,227 members of nine different environmental organizations. For these environmental movement participants, the federal government is seen as most responsible for addressing climate change. Government leadership is necessary because it has the power to set regulations and lead corporations and citizens toward pro-environmental behavior. However, a substantial number of participants also assert that individuals are the driving force in dealing with climate change. In this framework, individuals can take responsibility either through making lifestyle changes, or through applying pressure to government and businesses as citizens and consumers. Corporations are interpreted as unwilling to change on their own but must be coerced into becoming more environmentally sustainable by a strong state.","[Stoddart, Mark C.

Here we extended a cumulative environmental hazard inequality index (CEHII) - developed to assess inequalities in air pollution hazards - to compare the inequality among three urban counties in California: Alameda, San Diego, and Los Angeles. We included a metric for heat stress to the analysis because exposure to excessively hot weather is increasingly recognized as a threat to human health and well-being. We determined if inequalities from heat stress differed between the three regions and if this added factor modified the metric for inequality from cumulative exposure to air pollution. This analysis indicated that of the three air pollutants considered, diesel particulate matter had the greatest inequality, followed by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). As measured by our index, the inequalities from cumulative exposure to air pollution were greater than those of single pollutants. Inequalities were significantly different among single air pollutant hazards within each region and between regions; however, inequalities from the cumulative burdens did not differ significantly between any two regions. Modeled absolute and relative heat stress inequalities were small except for relative heat stress in San Diego which had the second highest inequality. Our analysis, techniques, and results provide useful insights for policy makers to assess inequalities between regions and address factors that contribute to overall environmental inequality within each region.

In this paper, we test the environmental justice hypothesis for climate change-related variables in the bi-national context of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua using a matched set of social indicators from the 2000 US and Mexican censuses and biophysical data related to heat, ozone and flooding. T-test results demonstrated that social marginality and climate change-related hazard exposure were generally higher in Juarez as compared to El Paso. Using spatial regression models, we found patterns of environmental injustice in the sister cities related to these climate change-related hazards. Lower social class neighborhoods generally faced increased risks from extreme heat in both cities, and from floods and peak ozone in El Paso. In El Paso, children also faced significant and disproportionate exposure to peak ozone, while female-headed households were significantly more burdened by flooding and peak ozone in Juarez. Despite the limitations of this cross-sectional study, we can expect injustices to heighten as neighborhoods at-risk now become increasingly exposed under climate change scenarios. In sum, this analysis provides a model for investigating inequities associated with future small area impacts of climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This financial incentives-based climate change mitigation strategy proposed by the UNEP, World Bank, GEF and environmental NGOs seeks to integrate forests into carbon sequestration schemes. Its proponents view REDD+ as part of an adaptive strategy to counter the effects of global climate change. This paper combines the theoretical approaches of market environmentalism and environmental narratives to examine the politics of environmental knowledge that are redefining socio-nature relations in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania to make mangrove forests amenable to markets. Through a case study of a REDD-readiness climate change mitigation and adaptation project, we demonstrate how a shift in resource control and management from local to global actors builds upon narratives of environmental change (forest loss) that have little factual basis in environmental histories. We argue that the proponents of REDD+ (Tanzanian state, aid donors, environmental NGOs) underestimate the agency of forest-reliant communities who have played a major role in the making of the delta landscape and who will certainly resist the injustices they are facing as a result of this shift from community-based resource management to fortress conservation.

Various strategies for adaptation to climate change have been proposed. In this paper we examine the prospects of what we call the 'transgenic adaptation strategy', i.e. the appeal to use transgenic seeds to adapt to climate change, through the lens of smallholder maize farming in Mexico. Landraces are the bedrock of maize production in Mexico. We consider how maize farmers may respond to climate change and the effects of those responses on crop diversity. In this paper, we argue that the promotion of the transgenic adaptation strategy is problematic for biological and social reasons. Smallholder livelihoods in southern Mexico could suffer a disproportionate negative impact if transgenic technology is privileged as a response to climate change. Agroecological and evolutionary approaches to addressing the effects of climate change on smallholder agriculture provides an alternative adaptive strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

East Boston is predominantly a residential area with some industrial and commercial activities, particularly along the coastal fringe. Everett, a city to the north of Boston, has a diversified industrial and commercial base. While these two communities have similar socioeconomic characteristics, they differ substantially in the extent to which residents would be impacted by increased coastal flooding. In East Boston, a large portion of residents would be flooded, while in Everett, it is the commercial/industrial districts that are primarily vulnerable. Through a series of workshops with residents in each community, we found that the target populations do not have an adaptation perspective or knowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge. Furthermore, they do not feel included in the planning processes within their communities. However, a common incentive for both communities was an intense commitment to their communities and an eagerness to learn more and become actively engaged in decisions regarding climate change adaptation. The lessons that can be applied to other studies include 1) images are powerful tools in communicating concepts, 2) understanding existing cultural knowledge and values in adaptation planning is essential to the planning process and 3) engaging local residents at the beginning of the process can create important educational opportunities and develop trust and consensus that is necessary for moving from concept to implementation.","[Douglas, Ellen M.; Wiggin, Jack] Univ Massachusetts, Urban Harbors Inst, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Kirshen, Paul H.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Paolisso, Michael; Enrici, Ashley] Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ruth, Matthias] Univ Maryland, Ctr Integrat Environm Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Douglas, EM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Urban Harbors Inst, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",ellen.douglas@umb.edu,,,NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NAO08OAR4310722],"This research was funded by a grant from the NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP; NAO08OAR4310722).

Very few assessments of the social forces that influence greenhouse gas emissions have examined gender inequality. Empirical research suggests that women are more likely than men to support environmental protection. Various strands of feminist theory suggest that this is due to women's traditional roles as caregivers, subsistence food producers, water and fuelwood collectors, and reproducers of human life. Other theorists argue that women's status and environmental protection are linked because the exploitation of women and the exploitation of nature are interconnected processes. For these theoretical and empirical reasons, we hypothesize that in societies with greater gender equality there will be relatively lower impacts on the environment, controlling for other factors. We test this hypothesis using quantitative analysis of cross-national data, focusing on the connection between women's political status and CO2 emissions per capita. We find that CO2 emissions per capita are lower in nations where women have higher political status, controlling for GDP per capita, urbanization, industrialization, militarization, world-system position, foreign direct investment, the age dependency ratio, and level of democracy. This finding suggests that efforts to improve gender equality around the world may work synergistically with efforts to curtail global climate change and environmental degradation more generally.

In this paper it is argued that in order to distribute such costs justly, it is necessary to have a nuanced understanding of what types of burdens they represent. Climate managing policies are usually divided into responses that seek to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mitigation) and responses that seek to prevent harm arising from a changing climate (adaptation). Some have argued that there are normatively significant differences between mitigation and adaptation: that the two responses adhere to different logics and evoke different patterns of burden-sharing. This paper argues that the relevant distinction is instead between negative and positive climate duties, i.e. whether an agent has a duty to undertake climate-managing policies on account of the harm its excessive emissions are causing or simply on account of its ability to assist those in need. The paper offers a typology of the different mitigation and adaptation responses that can be sorted under the negative/positive distinctions. This way of conceptualizing the issue not only enables us to better address the burden-sharing question, offering a more nuanced understanding of the types of climate burdens that are ascribable to agents and pointing out the appropriate roles of contributory responsibility and ability. It also clarifies aspects of the climate negotiations, and explains why it matters whether adaptation finance transferred to vulnerable countries is portrayed as compensation for harmful emissions or simply as donor countries discharging their humanitarian duties.

It is primarily a system of ideas and principles, rather than a rationally argued intellectual position. Its ideas are powerful and influential on developments in policy and politics, but it is presently less well grounded in the academy. Green economists do not dwell overmuch on introspection and their method is implicit rather than explicit, relying on a grounded, embedded and phenomenological approach and rejecting the scientism and spurious objectivity of neoclassical economics. In this paper I outline four key issues central to a green study of the economy: the need to end economic growth; the importance of equality and questions of the just distribution of resources; the requirement to consider appropriate scale in economic decision-making; and the need to include multiple perspectives in the study of economics.","Southlands Coll, Roehampton Business Sch, London SW15 5PU, England","Cato, MS (corresponding author), Southlands Coll, Roehampton Business Sch, Roehampton Lane, London SW15 5PU, England.",molly.scott-cato@roehampton.ac.uk,,,,,,63,6,6,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using a case study, the authors identify diversions from Beck's original theory and explore the importance of social constructionist and political economy perspectives. The article focuses on corn farmers in southwestern Michigan to examine climate risk recognition and reflexive responses, concentrating on the role of nitrogen fertilizer as a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Results from interviews, focus groups, and a mail survey indicate that dualistic worldviews and exposure to limited and/or biased information can inhibit farmers from acknowledging climate change as a risk. In addition, structural barriers inhibit farmers from reducing nitrogen fertilizer application in response to climate change. These findings offer insights applicable to climate change mitigation efforts and also demonstrate the importance of both social constructionist and political economy perspectives to identify barriers to reflexive modernization.","[Stuart, Diana] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [McDermott, Matthew] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Agr Recreat & Resource Studies, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schewe, Rebecca L.] Mississippi State Univ, Starkville, MS USA","Stuart, D (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",dstuart@msu.edu,"Stuart, Diana/L-4913-2017","Schewe, Rebecca/0000-0002-2029-8241",,,,61,30,30,0,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1086-0266,1552-7417,,ORGAN ENVIRON,Organ.

We outline here key dimensions of the debate, pointing to areas where human geographers can make a particularly strong contribution. These include: issues of adaptation and resilience; sustainability; environmental justice and socially unequal impacts of climate change; and psychological as well as physical impacts of environment on health. Key themes in the emerging research agenda include the significance of affect and emotion for the perception and communication of hazard and risk associated with the health impacts of climate change. Also, understanding exposure to health risks of climate change requires knowledge of complex and individually variable daily action spaces and residential mobility over the lifecourse. We argue for research that considers complex processes operating at various geographical scales, linking arguments about 'global health' with the more local and individual processes that contribute to health determinants. Much of the literature on health impacts of climate change demonstrates socially and geographically unequal effects, which often exacerbate existing health disparities. This highlights the links between this field of health geography and other geographical research concerned with sustainability and environmental justice.","[Curtis, S.

Despite the Clean Development Mechanism and other efforts to diffuse low carbon technologies to developing countries, China has over the last decades continued to construct hundreds of new thermal coal power plants leading not only to skyrocketing emissions in the present but also to long-term carbon lock-in. In light of this, China is likely to continue to put strong upward pressure on global emissions for many decades to come. Ignoring the seriousness of this situation, many rich countries have persisted to seek marginal improvements to intermittent low-energy sources such as wind power rather than taking the lead in developing breakthrough baseload technologies such as nuclear fusion. This paper argues that only such high-energy technologies, if made significantly cheaper than any fossil alternatives, will be capable of breaking the current carbon lock-in process in China and other developing countries.

Given the emotive nature of the issue, care must be taken that population growth is introduced in an appropriate way. Population growth is undeniably a factor in human impact on environmental systems, but this does not necessarily entail that it must be reduced if manipulating other variables can reduce overall impact. In the context of climate change, a discussion of responsibility for population increase requires engaging in the question of legitimate state policies to incentivise smaller families and to reduce fertility rates by measures such as promoting social justice, especially gender justice. It must also, however, address the other factors that contribute to human impact on global environmental systems. Examples of such factors include affluence and technology. This article argues that it cannot be permissible for a state to implement policies that make parents bear the full costs of their procreative decisions. Instead it suggests that there is a collective duty of a society to make investments and social changes to accommodate any population growth that might come about after permissible measures to reduce fertility rates are implemented.","Univ Oxford, Oxford Geoengn Programme, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","Heyward, C (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Geoengn Programme, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",jennifer.heyward@philosophy.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,44,7,7,0,31,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",1370-0049,1783-1431,,ETHICAL PERSPECT,Ethical Perspect.,DEC,2012,19,4,,,SI,,703,732,,10.2143/EP.19.4.2182832,,,30,Ethics; Philosophy,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Philosophy,080RR,WOS:000314261500005,,,,,2021-08-07,

In this paper we answer four interrelated questions about residential landscaping preferences with a case study in Raleigh, NC: (1) How are residents' landscaping preferences influenced by what residents believe their neighbors prefer? (2) Do residents accurately assess their neighbors' landscaping preferences? (3) How does ethnicity influence landscaping preferences? and (4) Do the socio-demographic and neighborhood norm based correlates of landscaping preferences persist when both are accounted for in multivariate models? Respondents (n = 179) in this study preferred a 50% native plant garden design over 100% turf grass or the 75% and 100% native plant garden designs, and inaccurately assumed that their neighbors preferred turf over the native plant garden based landscaping designs. These results suggest that correcting erroneous assumptions about neighborhood preferences may alleviate normative pressure against adopting alternatives to turf grass landscaping. Although landscaping choices were best predicted by what residents perceived their neighbors preferred, ethnicity, income, and home ownership were also related to landscape preferences. African American ethnicity and income were positively related to preference for turf grass coverage. Environmental justice concerns linked to urban vegetation should be considered in light of the finding that African Americans appeared to prefer turf grass dominated landscaping. Results from this study indicate that middle income neighborhoods with high levels of home ownership may prove most receptive to initiatives aimed at increasing the use of more sustainable landscaping.

Hence, climate change also raises issues of moral responsibility and the protection of human rights. Although there is a general understanding among the world's leaders that rich nations have to take the lead in reducing global emissions and paying for developing nations to initiate mitigation measures and adaptation, these are still core issues remaining to be solved. This article investigates how the South African media constructed representations of climate change, with a special emphasis on the interface of climate change, poverty, and justice during the African Conference of the Parties, COP17. The mass media is a central arena where the struggle to define the climate crisis plays out and through which most citizens are exposed to these issues. Can the heated moments of international climate negotiations be an arena for promoting justice issues and making them known to the public?","Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, N-5020 Bergen, Norway","Johannessen, J (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,36,5,5,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0258-7203,1996-2126,,S AFR J HUM RIGHTS,S.

Among the main topics of the text were the socio-economic and climatic vulnerabilities of the country, including the situation of the poor. With the aim of analysing the argumentation regarding climate change and social justice we develop a combined linguistic and discursive approach, starting with occurrences of keywords pertaining to rights, equity and poverty. The White Paper's conceptualisation of climate change is explored as a narrative, at the level of the text as a whole. This combined analysis shows that the legal rights of the poor are hardly given any place in the argumentation, whereas less constricting political intentions are far more present. Furthermore, the text attributes a passive role to the poor, dependent on the benevolence of a government that attributes the role of hero to itself.","[Flottum, Kjersti] Univ Bergen, Dept Foreign Languages, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Gjerstad, Oyvind] Univ Bergen, Dept Res Management, N-5020 Bergen, Norway","Flottum, K (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Foreign Languages, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,40,7,8,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0258-7203,1996-2126,,S AFR J HUM RIGHTS,S.

Learning from the case of water in the most advanced court challenge to neo-liberal state power that has yet been adjudicated, in Johannesburg in 2009, it is just as likely that rights-talk will be co-opted by neo-liberalism. If that happens more systematically within the climate justice struggle, at a time activism intensifies and court cases emerge more frequently, momentum towards a genuine breakthrough against corporate control of global environmental governance (amplified now under the rubric of the 'Green Economy') could well be distracted, halted or even reversed. The classical problems associated with rights-based narratives - their basis in liberal individualism and disconnection from broader socio-economic and ecological processes - may continue to be crippling, as witnessed in the example of South African water policy, law and activism. The specific case involves a Paris-based water privatisation company (Suez) whose policies in Johannesburg led five Sowetans to sue the city to increase water supply and cease imposing pre-payment meters. The same ideological debates - how to fuse neo-liberal imperatives with rights rhetoric - took centre stage during the June 2012 Rio+20 Earth Summit. There, the dominant trend towards market determinations of nature required a stronger countervailing 'decommodification' narrative than 'rights talk' can offer. The question posed here, is whether using human rights considerations will make contestation of 'neo-liberalised nature' any easier, and the answer arrived at is negative, based on the evidence from Johannesburg. Instead, 'commoning' is the alternative narrative, ie arriving at the commons through and beyond rights.","Univ KwaZulu Natal UKZN, Ctr Civil Soc CCS, Sch Built Environm & Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa","Bond, P (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal UKZN, Ctr Civil Soc CCS, Sch Built Environm & Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa.",,"Bond, Patrick/N-5490-2013","Bond, Patrick/0000-0001-6657-7898",,,,9,6,7,3,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0258-7203,1996-2126,,S AFR J HUM RIGHTS,S.

Alternatively, if there are flaws in such markets, should society instead move towards retributive payments for 'ecological debt' based on both 'loss and damage' accounting (introduced at the UNFCCC COP18 in Doha) and environmental justice, in order that the valuing of nature is limited to fines for damages and then prohibitions on further pollution.

These plans will have important consequences for urban populations because they are likely to reshape and reconfigure urban infrastructures, services, and decision making processes. It is critical that these adaptation plans are developed in a way that is just. Criteria was developed that can be used to assess justice in adaptation so that the processes, priorities, and impacts address the needs of the most vulnerable urban populations. Further, mechanisms are outlined that have been proposed as responsible for producing urban injustice. The justice criteria are applied to the case of adaptation planning in Delhi and the extent to which poor and informal populations are included and affected by this planning. The analysis shows that adaptation planning in Delhi does not meet the justice criteria in part because of a lack of capacity and the political economy of poverty in the city. The criteria for justice and mechanisms of injustice offer an important step toward developing a greater understanding of not only whether city-level adaptation planning is just, but also why it is or is not.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Hughes, S (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",,,"Hughes, Sara/0000-0002-1282-6235",Advanced Study Program; Integrated Science Program of the National Center for Atmospheric Research,"This research was supported by funding from the Advanced Study Program and Integrated Science Program of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and assisted by The Energy and Resources Institute.

A key feature of the GDRs framework is that it is modeled on the assignment of a right to development to individuals, such that individuals with incomes below a development threshold are nominally exempted from obligations to pay for mitigation and adaptation. Obligations for those over the threshold are calculated in the same way for rich persons in poor countries and rich persons in rich countries. As income distribution within countries is taken into account and all countries have some wealthy people, all countries have a positive obligation to contribute to global mitigation and adaptation requirements, eliminating the sharp distinction between Annex I and non-Annex I countries. In the last few years, GDRs has become one of the most widely known of the many so-called burden-sharing frameworks that have been proposed. In this essay, one of the co-authors of the GDRs framework presents the framework's fundamental principles, describes its place in the larger discussion of burden-sharing and climate justice, and reflects on its prospects in the next phase of the global climate negotiations. Hopefully it will be helpful both to readers new to GDRs and to our existing supporters and critics.

First, to give a concise account of the current global climate situation, its previous history according to the palaeoclimate record, and climate scientists' predictions of the consequences of various scenarios of global climate change. Then to explain why so many people continue to be oblivious to the enormous risks of continuing with business as usual. Methodology/approach - The approach is through a comprehensive study of the relevant evidence and the scientific and scholarly literature, interwoven with philosophical reflections on their significance. Findings - The findings are as follows: the evidence for the anthropogenic nature of global warming is overwhelming, and the prognoses for continued burning of fossil fuels (sea level rise, extreme weather, etc.) are dire. The denial stems in large part from the undue influence of climate scepticism movements, lavishly funded by the fossil fuel industries, combined with a variety of psycho-social and economic factors. Social implications - The implications are several. Given the complex nature of global warming, scientists need to do a better job of communicating their findings to the general public, and scholars and academics need to find ways to expose the machinations of the fossil fuel industries. And given the global impact of climate change, citizens of the developed nations need to see that a radical change in their behaviour is demanded not only by considerations of social justice but also even by their own self-interest. Originality value - The value of this philosophical approach is that it affords a more comprehensive view of the situation around global warming than we get from the more specialised disciplines.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland","Parkes, G (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland.",,,,,,,65,3,3,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",2051-5030,,978-1-78350-137-3; 978-1-78350-136-6,ADV SUSTAIN ENV JUST,,,2013,13,,,,,,51,80,,10.1108/S2051-5030(2013)0000013007,,,30,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BD2BC,WOS:000358644800004,,,,,2021-08-07,

Legal scholars have in turn begun to explore how the many different fields of law will and should respond. During this nascent period, one overarching question has gone unexamined: How will the legal system as a whole organize around climate change adaptation? Will a new, distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy emerge, or will legal institutions simply work away at the problem through unrelated, self-contained fields, as in the famous Law of the Horse? This Article is the first to examine that question comprehensively, to move beyond thinking about the law and climate change adaptation to consider the law of climate change adaptation. Part I of the Article lays out our methodological premises and approach. Using a model we call Stationarity Assessment, Part I explores how legal fields are structured and sustained based on assumptions about the variability of natural, social, and economic conditions, and how disruptions to that regime of variability can lead to the emergence of new fields of law and policy. Case studies of environmental law and environmental justice demonstrate the model's predictive power for the formation of new, distinct legal regimes. Part II applies the Stationarity Assessment model to the topic of climate change adaptation, using a case study of a hypothetical coastal region to demonstrate the potential for climate change impacts to disrupt relevant legal doctrines and institutions. We find that most fields of law appear to be capable of adapting effectively to climate change. In other words, without some active intervention, we expect the law and policy of climate change adaptation to follow the path of the Law of the Horse a collection of fields independently adapting to climate change rather than organically coalescing into a new and distinct field. Part III explores why, notwithstanding this conclusion, it may still be desirable to seek a different trajectory. Focusing on the likelihood of systemic adaptation decisions with perverse and harmful results, we identify the potential benefits offered by intervening to shape a new and distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy. Part IV then identifies the contours of such a field, exploring the distinct purposes of reducing vulnerability, ensuring resiliency, and safeguarding equity. These features provide the normative policy components for a law of climate change adaptation that would be more than just a Law of the Horse. This new field would not replace or supplant any existing field, however, as environmental law did with regard to nuisance law, and it would not be dominated by substantive doctrine. Rather, like the field of environmental justice, this new legal regime would serve as a holistic overlay across other fields to ensure more efficient, effective, and just climate adaptation solutions.","[Ruhl, J.

Her crew's colonial attitudes towards the Indigenous Inuit inhabitants of the region have been perpetuated in archaeological interpretations of the ship's impact on local Inuit communities and in media coverage of the rediscovery of the ship by archaeologists in 2010, which framed the ship as a symbol of Canada's Arctic sovereignty. As climate change continues to fuel international debates about the control of Arctic resources and to negatively impact the Arctic archaeological record, Arctic archaeology promises to become increasingly political. In the Canadian Arctic, a range of collaborative projects that bring together archaeologists and Inuit community groups to better understand the human history of the north have made important steps towards decolonizing our discipline and could ripple outwards to support Inuit demands for a voice in international debates about Arctic sovereignty.

ADAPTE is an issue-driven research endeavor that integrates different disciplinary domains to explore the complex nature of urban vulnerability/adaptive capacity to weather and air pollution in Buenos Aires, Bogota, Mexico City and Santiago. The paper also critically reflects on some of the possible challenges to be encountered, along with the benefits to be gleaned, when doing issue-driven research that seeks to be scientifically robust and socially relevant and is defined by such attributes as integration of heterogeneous research domains, interactivity and reflexivity. ADAPTE's efforts to integrate concepts, methods and data from different disciplines were fundamental in the design of a conceptual framework on urban vulnerability. The integrating research question and the use of quantitative and qualitative methods allowed ADAPTS to shed a slightly different light on the nature and interconnections between the different dimensions of urban vulnerability. However, it has proven difficult for us to fully explore the dynamics of urban vulnerability as well as the issues of scale and context. A set of cultural and communication challenges has arisen, not only from the diverse conceptualization approaches, methods, differing terminologies and mechanisms for analyzing and presenting results that ADAPTS has attempted to integrate, but also from institutional and interpersonal issues affecting team interactions.

Scholars have traditionally explained the rigidity of Chinese diplomacy with reference to economic interests and power, and in the process understated the importance of equity norms. In international negotiations, China has served as one of the key architects and promoters of the common but differentiated responsibility principle, which holds that global environmental justice requires that developed countries bear the primary obligation for combating climate change. China has used this principle strategically in order to legitimize its opposition to emission limits. However, China's negotiating stance cannot be defined simply as the instrumental use of norms, as Beijing is genuinely sensitive to issues of equity. These equity concerns have occasionally led China to act in a manner that, from a strict cost-benefit analysis, runs counter to its own economic interests. In sum, notions of environmental justice are simultaneously a tool China uses to pursue its interests and a force that structures China's interest.","Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA","Stalley, P (corresponding author), Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",,"Stalley, Phillip/S-7378-2019",,,,,37,11,11,1,28,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1526-3800,1536-0091,,GLOBAL ENVIRON POLIT,Glob.

Here, we apply a new analytic tool to identify geographic areas in the contiguous United States that may be more likely to experience disproportionate impacts of SLR, and to determine if and where socially vulnerable populations would bear disproportionate costs of adaptation. We use the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to identify socially vulnerable coastal communities, and combine this with output from a SLR coastal property model that evaluates threats of inundation and the economic efficiency of adaptation approaches to respond to those threats. Results show that under the mid-SLR scenario (66.9 cm by 2100), approximately 1,630,000 people are potentially affected by SLR. Of these, 332,000 (similar to 20%) are among the most socially vulnerable. The analysis also finds that areas of higher social vulnerability are much more likely to be abandoned than protected in response to SLR. This finding is particularly true in the Gulf region of the United States, where over 99% of the most socially vulnerable people live in areas unlikely to be protected from inundation, in stark contrast to the least socially vulnerable group, where only 8% live in areas unlikely to be protected. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the equity and environmental justice implications of SLR in climate change policy analysis and coastal adaptation planning.","[Martinich, Jeremy; Jantarasami, Lesley] US EPA, Climate Change Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Neumann, James; Ludwig, Lindsay] Ind Econ Inc, Cambridge, MA USA","Martinich, J (corresponding author), US EPA, Climate Change Div, 1200 Penn Ave NW,MC6207-J, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",martinich.jeremy@epa.gov,,,,,,34,56,57,0,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Social justice, community, frugality, and personal integrity were common themes that emerged from the transcripts. Concern about the environment' per se is not the primary motivation for most interviewees' action. Typically, they are more concerned about the plight of poorer people who will suffer from climate change. Although biospheric values are important to the participants, they tended to score altruistic values significantly higher on a survey instrument. Thus, it may not be necessary to promote biospheric values to encourage lower-carbon lifestyles. Participants' narratives of how they became engaged with climate action reveal links to human rights issues and groups as much as environmental organisations and positive experiences in nature. Some interviewees offered very broad (positive) visions of what 'a low-carbon lifestyle' means to them. This, and the fact that 'climate change' is not necessarily seen as interesting even by these highly engaged people, reveals a need for climate change mitigation campaigns to promote a holistic view of a lower-carbon future, rather than simply offering a 'to do' list to 'combat climate change'.

For us the term does not just mean the interplay of deterring, compelling, defensive and offensive force in the pursuit of a self-defined national interest. Above all, and at a fundamental level it includes the safety and quality of life of all human beings and their ecosystems. Conceptually, we could define such security as the reciprocal value of insecurity. It refers to all those trends and factors - environmental, economic, social, political and cultural - that increase the risk, exposure and vulnerability for a given population. In earlier works it is contended that within highly complex and interconnected systems, the security of the whole, including that of its seemingly most protected components, paradoxically depends upon the system's weakest links. There is the urgency for exploring broader and longer-term mechanisms to devise and strengthen global governance so that world stability, security, social justice, sustainability and well-being for all are guaranteed.","Univ Tehran, Fac Law & Polit Sci, Tehran, Iran","Mossalanejad, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Law & Polit Sci, Tehran, Iran.",,,,,,,36,3,3,0,21,UNIV TEHRAN,TEHRAN,"GRADUATE FAC ENV, NO 20 GHODS ST, ENGHELAB AVE, PO BOX 14155-6135, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",1735-6865,,,INT J ENVIRON RES,Int.

This article draws largely upon the empirical analysis and results with some reference to the method. An ethical matrix approach is used to provide a summary of a so-called ethical landscape, primarily from a European perspective, in which perspectives of CCS are mapped out as they relate to certain ethical principles. Opinions represented on the matrix begin to coalesce around compliance with the principle of providing benefits (a pre-requisite of pursuing development) while potential faultlines were observed for the following principles: environmental justice, preventing harm, scientific/technical competence, managerial/regulatory competence.

This daunting prospect raises critical questions of sustainability; social justice; genuine public participation and social learning; effective financing for long term social and economic benefit; connected polycentric governance; and the appropriate use of scientific knowledge bonded to public and political trust. While the development of most shorelines is nominally shaped by public administrative action, rapid coastal migration and excessive economic concentration have turned many threatened coastlines into a stage for settlement hazard and institutional chaos. In Portugal, despite clear evidence of increasing flooding and erosion, appropriate management responses are proving inadequate, both in the turbulent planning framework and in the scarce financial provision for future safeguard. The only plausible alternatives seem to lie in the processes of progressive adaptive governance, involving the trust and full participation of local communities; strongly supported scientific assessments of threat and safety; and fresh approaches to finding suitable funding sources. However, as evident from interviews with key actors in coastal planning in Portugal, the lack of policy clarity and political will, the weak science and poor coordination of stakeholders, combined with the particular regenerating coastal cultures of these communities, make any organised adaptive approaches highly problematic. This consequently places more emphasis on the rich cultural meanings of coastal occupation; of national identity in a time of economic crisis; of social justice in a period of reduced coastal maintenance funding; and of a more measured and sequential approach to an adaptive coastal governance.

Based on a theoretical review of three relevant approaches to risk analysis (risk society, environmental justice, and urban vulnerability as impact), we hypothesize that health risks from exposure to air pollution and temperature in these cities do not necessarily depend on socio-economic inequalities. To test this hypothesis, we gathered, validated, and analyzed temperature, air pollution, mortality and socioeconomic vulnerability data from the three study cities. Our results show the association between air pollution levels and socioeconomic vulnerabilities did not always correlate within the study cities. Furthermore, the spatial differences in socioeconomic vulnerabilities within cities do not necessarily correspond with the spatial distribution of health impacts. The present study improves our understanding of the multifaceted nature of health risks and vulnerabilities associated with global environmental change. The findings suggest that health risks from atmospheric conditions and pollutants exist without boundaries or social distinctions, even exhibiting characteristics of a boomerang effect (i.e., affecting rich and poor alike) on a smaller scale such as areas within urban regions. We used human mortality, a severe impact, to measure health risks from air pollution and extreme temperatures. Public health data of better quality (e.g., morbidity, hospital visits) are needed for future research to advance our understanding of the nature of health risks related to climate hazards.

Using research with GSA student members, GSA advisors, high school principals, and district-level administrators from a case study of high schools, we identify school practices that either support or destabilize antigay school environments: Silence and passive resistance, the provision of safe spaces, and attempts and challenges to breaking the silence. We then explore the limitations of current efforts to create safe-school environments for sexual minority youth and end by discussing how systemic school reform efforts could be used to transform the broader social context.","[Mayberry, Maralee; Currie, Sean] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Chenneville, Tiffany] Univ S Florida, Dept Pediat, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Mayberry, M (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave,CPR 107, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",mayberry@usf.edu,,,,,,48,21,21,0,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0013-1245,1552-3535,,EDUC URBAN SOC,Educ.

This article examines Masayesva's film Paatuwaqatsi: Water, Land and Life (2007), which documents a 1,650-mile run made by Hopis from their home villages in Northern Arizona to Mexico City in early 2006 The run marked the closure of the Mohave Generating Station in southern Nevada and the Black Mesa coal mine which fuelled the power plant. It also celebrated the shutting down of the controversial coal slurry pipeline between the plant and mine that required for its operation the pumping of 1.2 billion gallons of pristine water annually from the Navajo Aquifer, which lies under the homelands of the Hopi and Navajo nations. The article explains how Hopis' affective relationship with place is put into action through the acts of running, prayer and personal sacrifice. It reviews Masayesva's filmmaking career to date and considers his core idea of the indigenous aesthetic, a set of principles that has guided the practical decisions and artistic choices he has made in the course of over thirty years' working as an independent media producer. After a close analysis of selected scenes in Paatuwaqatsi, the article concludes by noting, first, how the film negotiates internal divisions within Hopi society over development and environmental issues and, second, how it engages the impact of continuing drought and ongoing climate change on the American Southwest.","Aberystwyth Univ, Dept English & Creat Writing, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales","Padget, M (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Dept English & Creat Writing, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",mtp@aber.ac.uk,,,,,,42,1,1,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-8758,1469-5154,,J AM STUD,J.

Some people are enjoying the benefits of energy use and other emissions-generating activities, but those activities are causing other people to suffer the burdens of climate change. Political philosophers have begun to pay more attention to the problem of climate justice. However, contributors to the literature have made quite different methodological assumptions about how we should develop a theory of climate justice and defend principles of climate justice. So far, there has been little systematic or detailed discussion of these methodological issues. One way to approach these issues is by developing a methodological framework for thinking about climate justice, or more specifically, a five-stage framework, drawing on recent work on two issues: first, the distinction between ideal and non-ideal theory; and second, the distinction between integrationist and isolationist approaches to environmental and climate justice. This methodological framework can also be used to inform critical analysis of extant theories of climate justice, for example, through a critical discussion of two key features of the theory of climate justice developed by Simon Caney.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Dept Polit, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Bell, D (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Dept Polit, 40-42 Great North Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",,,"Bell, Derek/0000-0002-4983-0780",,,,46,3,3,2,19,ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY INC,DENTON,"UNIV NORTH TEXAS, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, PO BOX 13496, DENTON, TX 76203-3496 USA",0163-4275,2153-7895,,ENVIRON ETHICS,Environ.

J,"Toft, KH",,,,"Toft, Kristian Hoyer",,,The Human Rights Approach to Climate Change: An Overview,ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It is often argued that concerns about the equity of a global climate agreement might appropriately be addressed in the language of human rights. The human rights approach has been promoted by a number of international political actors, including the UN Human Rights Council. As such, human rights are instrumentally applied as a solution to what could be called the justice problem in climate negotiations. In order to assess the degree to which human rights could be a useful approach to the justice problem with regard to to climate change, four major issues need to be examined. First, there is the distinction between human rights as protection against climate change versus the right to emit greenhouse gases. Both understandings are found in the debate on climate justice, but they are often not made explicit. Second, the human rights as protection approach with a focus on (a) right holders, both presently and in the future, needs to be elucidated, as well as (b) the human rights principles that are at stake, and (c) the duties and duty holders involved. Third, the human right to emit greenhouse gases needs to be clarified in the context of subsistence rights and equal per capita emission rights. Finally, there is the question of whether the cosmopolitan conception of human rights is at odds with the goal of ensuring that individuals assume responsibility for their own carbon-dependent lifestyle.","Aalborg Univ, Dept Learning & Philosophy, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark","Toft, KH (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Learning & Philosophy, Sohngaardsholmvej 2, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.",kht@learning.aau.dk,,"Toft, Kristian Hoyer/0000-0002-9628-1606",,,,23,1,1,0,0,ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY INC,DENTON,"UNIV NORTH TEXAS, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, PO BOX 13496, DENTON, TX 76203-3496 USA",0163-4275,2153-7895,,ENVIRON ETHICS,Environ.

There are two broadly compatible Rawlsian ways of addressing climate change. The first alternative is based on the two principles that Rawls applies to the domains of international and intergenerational justice (the Principle of Assistance, and the Principle of Just Savings). The second alternative starts from Rawls' general theory of international justice, in particular his idea of a Society of Peoples, which is an idealized vision of a peaceful and stable association of peoples that are internally well-ordered, and share a desire to respect and uphold international law. Given (a) the statutes peoples are willing to observe, (b) the defining characteristics of peoples, and (c) the fact that Rawls indicates that his own rendering of international law is incomplete, there may be grounds for proposing an additional statute, or an amendment, to The Law of Peoples, that pertains to climate change and that does not contradict, but rather follows from, the general framework of the theory. The latter alternative provides a more viable account of climate justice than critics has hitherto acknowledged.","Bunkerud Univ Coll, Dept Polit Sci & Human Rights, Sch Business & Social Sci, N-3007 Drammen, Norway","Huseby, R (corresponding author), Bunkerud Univ Coll, Dept Polit Sci & Human Rights, Sch Business & Social Sci, PB 7053, N-3007 Drammen, Norway.",robert.huseby@stv.uio.no,,,,,,30,3,3,0,18,ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY INC,DENTON,"UNIV NORTH TEXAS, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, PO BOX 13496, DENTON, TX 76203-3496 USA",0163-4275,,,ENVIRON ETHICS,Environ.

This paper argues that human-induced climate change and its implication in a range of extreme events extends and complicates the pursuit of justice in the context of differentiated vulnerability to hazards. But the challenge of living with natural hazards can provoke and inspire the idea of global environmental justice in other ways. Sustained consideration of the unpredictability of physical environments draws us into engagement with the temporality and spatiality of earth processes. It points to the ways that any extended place-based inhabitation must involve demanding accommodations to environmental uncertainty raising questions about how to do justice' to these achievements. Confronting forms of hardship that are triggered by the dynamics of the earth itself can also be taken as a prompt to conceive of environmental justice not only in regard to what others deserve or are entitled to, but in terms of what might be offered simply in response to their suffering. In this way, the paper proposes, thinking through natural hazard and disaster might play a part in re-imagining the very concept of environmental justice.","[Clark, Nigel] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Chhotray, Vasudha; Few, Roger] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Clark, N (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Farrer Ave, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",n.clark2@lancaster.ac.uk; v.chhotray@uea.ac.uk; r.few@uea.ac.uk,"Few, Roger/AAT-3914-2021","Few, Roger/0000-0001-6653-1400; Clark, Nigel/0000-0002-6666-1739",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,,,44,9,9,0,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

In doing so it pays particular attention to two matters. First, it explores the value of a global' perspective on justice, highlighting how this framing reflects the nature and scales of contemporary environmental problems, the political-economic forces that pattern the uneven access to resources, and the vocabularies and narratives that are used to make claims about these inequities. Perhaps more significantly, the paper argues that a global framing appears to foreground particular aspects of environmental justice analysis, especially political and economic forces that produce injustices. Second, the introduction looks across the five papers in the section, each of which looks at a different environmental sector/issue: forests, transboundary waters, biodiversity conservation, energy and climate change, and disasters. It draws out the emergent themes across the papers, which involves discussions of the location of environmental struggles at new commodity frontiers, the limitations of distributive approaches to justice, and the relationship between social and environmental justice.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Martin, A (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",adrian.martin@uea.ac.uk,,"Martin, Adrian/0000-0003-2916-7712",,,,30,26,26,0,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

This paper contends that articulations of climate justice pointed to the emergence of three co-constitutive logics: antagonism, the common(s), and solidarity. Firstly, we argue that climate justice involves an antagonistic framing of climate politics that breaks with attempts to construct climate change as a post-political issue. Secondly, we suggest that climate justice involves the formation of pre-figurative political activity, expressed through acts of commoning. Thirdly, we contend that climate justice politics generates solidarities between differently located struggles and these solidarities have the potential to shift the terms of debate on climate change. Bringing these logics into conversation can develop the significance of climate justice for political practice and strategy. We conclude by considering what is at stake in different articulations of climate justice and tensions in emerging forms of climate politics.","[Chatterton, Paul] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Featherstone, David; Routledge, Paul] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Chatterton, P (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",p.chatterton@leeds.ac.uk; david.featherstone@glasgow.ac.uk; paul.routledge@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,57,119,119,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0066-4812,1467-8330,,ANTIPODE,Antipode,JUN,2013,45,3,,,,,602,620,,10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01025.x,,,19,Geography,Geography,129RU,WOS:000317860400007,,,,,2021-08-07,

METHODS: Block group-level tree canopy and impervious surface estimates were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset for densely populated urban areas of the United States and Puerto Rico, and linked to demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census. Racial/ethnic groups in a given block group were considered to live in HRRLC if at least half their population experienced the absence of tree canopy and at least half of the ground was covered by impervious surface (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, roads). Residential segregation was characterized for metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico using the multigroup dissimilarity index. RESULTS: After adjustment for ecoregion and precipitation, holding segregation level constant, non-Hispanic blacks were 52% more likely (95% CI: 37%, 69%), non-Hispanic Asians 32% more likely (95% CI: 18%, 47%), and Hispanics 21% more likely (95% CI: 8%, 35%) to live in HRRLC conditions compared with non-Hispanic whites. Within each racial/ethnic group, HRRLC conditions increased with increasing degrees of metropolitan area-level segregation. Further adjustment for home ownership and poverty did not substantially alter these results, but adjustment for population density and metropolitan area population attenuated the segregation effects, suggesting a mediating or confounding role. CONCLUSIONS: Land cover was associated with segregation within each racial/ethnic group, which may be explained partly by the concentration of racial/ethnic minorities into densely populated neighborhoods within larger, more segregated cities. In anticipation of greater frequency and duration of extreme heat events, climate change adaptation strategies, such as planting trees in urban areas, should explicitly incorporate an environmental justice framework that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HRRLC.","[Jesdale, Bill M.; Morello-Frosch, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Morello-Frosch, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cushing, Lara] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Jesdale, BM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bill.jesdale@gmail.com,,"Morello-Frosch, Rachel/0000-0003-1153-7287; Cushing, Lara/0000-0003-0640-6450; Jesdale, William/0000-0002-2697-3279",Hewlett Foundation; California Environmental Protection Agency [07-020],Support for this research was provided by the Hewlett Foundation and the California Environmental Protection Agency (no. 07-020).,,82,91,91,3,66,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

On its surface, this label is an accurate reflection of the state's forward-thinking stance across many environmental issues including pesticides, toxic substances, solid waste, and air quality. For all its promise, however, AB 32 can also be considered a low point in the landscape of conflict between state environmental regulators and California's environmental justice movement. While the legislation included several provisions to address the procedural and distributive dimensions of environmental justice, the implementation of AB 32 has been marked by heated conflict. The most intense conflicts over AB 32 revolve around the primacy of market mechanisms such as cap and trade. This article examines the drivers and the manifestations of these dynamics of collaboration and conflict between environmental justice advocates and state regulators, and pays particular attention to the scalar and racialized quality of the neoliberal discourse. The contentiousness of climate change politics in California offers scholars and practitioners around the world a cautionary tale of how the best intentions for integrating environmental justice principles into climate change policy do not necessarily translate into implementation and how underlying racialized fractures can upend collaboration between state and social movement actors.

Data Collection: Two instructors in a leadership-preparation program incorporated reflection assignments into their respective social-justice-related courses. One course was offered at the beginning of the program; the other offered at the end. Aspiring principals from two different cohorts of students participated in the study. The students' reflections were coded to identify themes and patterns that were found in their reflections and to see if any of their reflections changed over time. Findings: The authors found that students had varied experiences with people who identified as LGBTQ. Second, we found that discussion of sexual orientation was complicated by students' Christian beliefs. Third, we found that there was some change in the way in which students responded to sexual orientation, from a more passionate to a more analytical stance. We discuss these findings in light of the need for better assessment of future leaders' attitudes and actions and of our own heteronormativity and heterosexism. We discuss implications for our own teaching as well as for other teachers in preparation programs.","[Marshall, Joanne M.] Iowa State Univ, Sch Educ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hernandez, Frank] Univ Texas Permian Basin, Sch Educ, Odessa, TX 79762 USA","Marshall, JM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Sch Educ, N131 Lagomarcino Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jmars@iastate.edu,"Marshall, Joanne M./C-2535-2008","Marshall, Joanne M./0000-0002-4746-3809",,,,103,16,16,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0013-161X,1552-3519,,EDUC ADMIN QUART,Educ.

The established paradigm of society espouses domination of and separation from the natural environment, and manifests in environmentally detrimental attitudes and practices. Ecological exploitation appears to stem from the same root socioeconomic processes as social injustice-the hierarchical arrangement of power which places some groups and the environment in a position devoid of power or rights. Accordingly, endorsement of social and environmental injustice is exacerbated by tendencies toward domination and hierarchy, such as social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism. Moreover, injustice is perpetuated by motivation to uphold and justify social structures and the dominant paradigm, which stifles societal change toward intergroup fairness and equality and motivates denial and neglect in the face of environmental problems. Ideological tendencies in service of the system, including political conservatism, belief in a just world, and free market ideology, contribute toward perpetuating injustice as well as anti-environmental sentiment and behavior. Considering the shared psychological and ideological underpinnings of social and environmental injustice point to important interventions, such as cultivating interdependence through contact, fostering inclusive representations, and harnessing ideological motives toward overcoming resistance to change, and carry implications for expanding the scope of justice theory, research, and practice.","Amer Psychol Assoc, Washington, DC 20036 USA","Feygina, I (corresponding author), Amer Psychol Assoc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",irina.feygina@gmail.com,,,,,,82,14,14,0,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-7466,1573-6725,,SOC JUSTICE RES,Soc.

However, despite some rhetorical progress at the 2011 Durban climate conference, it has consistently rejected calls to take on binding targets to reduce its GHG emissions. The Chinese Government has understandably argued that developed states are responsible for the predominant share of historical GHG emissions, have greater capacity to pay for the cost of mitigation, and indeed have an obligation to do so before China is required to take action. However, due to the explosive growth in its GHG emissions, China is now in a position to single-handedly dash any hope of climate stability if its position does not change. On the diplomatic level, other big polluters, particularly the United States, will not enter into new binding agreements to reduce substantially their own GHG emissions without a credible commitment from China. Challenging the statist framing of the climate justice, this article explores the possibility for China to take on a leadership role in climate change diplomacy in a way that allows it to maintain its long-standing principled resistance to binding national emissions targets while making meaningful progress toward combating the problem. Action by China's rapidly growing affluent classes may hold the key to long-term climate stability.","[Harris, Paul G.; Chow, Alice S.

Based on the statements of nine coalitions, the analysis identifies three discourses on climate justice. The conflict discourse articulates the North-South duality over issues of historical responsibility for climate change. The transition discourse points to solving the problem of sharing the cost of mitigating climate change through a process of global low-carbon growth. The vulnerability discourse focuses on the urgency of ambitious actions by all parties. These three discourses, and their appropriation by the bargaining coalitions, are inherent of new alignments among developed and developing countries alliances and blocs that simultaneously reproduce and surpass the North-South ideological divide.","Univ Quebec, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Strategie Responsabil Sociale & Environm, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Audet, R (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Strategie Responsabil Sociale & Environm, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",audet.rene@uqam.ca,,"Audet, Rene/0000-0003-3748-8639",,,,38,18,18,3,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This policy, commonly known as the carbon policy or carbon tax, holds industries responsible for emissions they release through a carbon price. Because this will have an indirect effect on consumer costs, the policy also includes a compensation package for households indirectly impacted. This study, building upon past work in distributive justice, examines the determinants of the policy's acceptance and support. We proposed perceived fairness and effectiveness of the policy, and endorsement of free-market ideology, would directly predict policy acceptance. We tested this through an on-line survey of Australian citizens and found that policy acceptance was predicted by perceived fairness and effectiveness. More Australians found the policy acceptable (43 %) than unacceptable (36 %), and many found it neither acceptable nor unacceptable (21 %). In contrast, when asked about support, more Australians tended not to support the policy (53 %) than support it (47 %). Support was predicted by main effects for perceived fairness, effectiveness, free-market ideology, and the interaction between free-market ideology and effectiveness. We conclude by considering some of the implications of our results for the implementation of policies addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation, for theories of social justice and attitudinal ambivalence, and for the continuing integration of research between economics and psychology. Furthermore, we argue for the distinction between policy support and acceptance and discourage the interchangeable use of these terms.","[Dreyer, Stacia J.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Dreyer, Stacia J.; Walker, Iain] CSIRO, Social & Econ Sci, Floreat, WA, Australia","Dreyer, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",stacia.dreyer@maine.edu,"Walker, Iain/G-5457-2010","Walker, Iain/0000-0002-1020-5873",,,,36,33,33,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-7466,1573-6725,,SOC JUSTICE RES,Soc.

While current human security perspectives helpfully situate the pursuit of climate change adaption within questions of social justice, they have been less forthcoming in providing suitable analytical tools to conceptualize the relationship between power, inequality and vulnerability. To address this gap, insights from political ecology are used to specify the relational dynamics of vulnerability, i.e. the ways in which marginalized peoples are adversely incorporated into political, social and economic relationships that produce their vulnerability while simultaneously creating relative security for others. This perspective is elaborated with examples from Andhra Pradesh, India, where differential control over key productive assets including land, water, labour and credit is key to the hierarchical displacement of security/insecurity across the agrarian population. By foregrounding the relational dynamics of vulnerability, this article provides analytical tools that offer a fuller account of the possibilities and limits to public policy aimed at sustainable climate change adaptation.","Queens Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada","Taylor, M (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",marcus.taylor@queensu.ca,,"Taylor, Marcus/0000-0003-0944-601X",,,,72,68,69,1,65,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Curiously, as attention has shifted to other sites and scales of climate change politics matters of justice have tended to be neglected. In this paper, we examine how discourses of justice are emerging within urban responses to climate change. Drawing on a database of initiatives taking place in 100 global cities and qualitative case-study research in Philadelphia, Quito and Toronto, we examine how notions of distributive and procedural justice are articulated in climate change projects and plans in relation to both adaptation and mitigation. We find that there is limited explicit concern with justice at the urban level. However, where discourses of justice are evident there are important differences emerging between urban responses to adaptation and mitigation, and between those in the north and in the south. Adaptation responses tend to stress the distribution of 'rights' to protection, although those in the South also stress the importance of procedural justice. Mitigation responses also stress 'rights' to the benefits of responding to climate change, with limited concern for 'responsibilities' or for procedural justice. Intriguingly, while adaptation responses tend to stress the rights of individuals, we also find discourses of collective rights emerging in relation to mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The demonstrations were products of the mobilization of broad coalitions of groups, and we find significant variation in demonstrators' prognostic framings-the ways in which they formulated solutions to climate problems. Most notably, there was a tension between system-critical framings and those oriented around individual action. A large proportion of demonstrators expressed affinity with the global justice movement (GJM), but we find little evidence of an emerging climate justice frame among rank-and-file protesters.

Developed states are responsible, but are forecast to confront only moderate adverse effects; least developed states are not culpable and yet experience significant threats to livelihoods, assets and security. Adaptation finance addresses inequity by developed states facilitating/funding behaviour adjustments necessary for exposed communities to lessen climate risk. This article investigates the ground-level effectiveness of adaptation finance in climate vulnerable villages across Malawi, while controlling for disparities in vulnerability. Malawi and selected districts are both climate vulnerable and significant recipients of adaptation finance. This concludes a larger top-down multi-scalar analysis of climate justice, which applies the distribution and effectiveness of adaptation finance as a proxy. The study avails of participatory assessments to compare actions of villages receiving adaptation finance with those engaging in autonomous and informal adaptations. Adaptation finance villages: (a) address more climate related risks; and (b) enhance agency, security and sustainably lessen climate vulnerability. Conversely, informal practice villages attend to a lower proportion of climate risks and often develop short-term strategies with less enduring vulnerability reduction. Vulnerable communities receiving adaptation finance do change behaviours to reduce climate risk and thus secure local level climate justice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

Contrary to conventional views, the data show that vehicles and small stationary sources emit a majority of the air toxics nationally. Industrial sources, by contrast, rarely account for more than ten percent of cumulative cancer risks from all outdoor sources of air toxics. This pattern spans multiple spatial scales, ranging from census tracts to the nation as a whole. However, it is most pronounced in metropolitan areas, which have the lowest air quality and are home to eighty percent of the U.S. population. The secondary status of industrial facilities as sources of air toxics has important implications for the current debate over cap-and-trade regulation-the policy instrument of choice for controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. Environmental justice advocates have opposed GHG trading in significant part because it could exacerbate inequitable exposures to toxic co-pollutants, not GHGs themselves, in minority and low-income communities. The likelihood of such disparities occurring has remained an open empirical question. The geospatial data reveal that, apart from a few readily identifiable census tracts, the potential for GHG trading to cause toxic hotspots is extremely low. Moreover, for the few jurisdictions in which disparities cannot be ruled out, targeted policies exist to prevent them without compromising market efficiency.","Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Adelman, DE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,141,4,4,0,484,INDIANA LAW JOURNAL,BLOOMINGTON,"INDIANA UNIV SCHOOL LAW, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA",0019-6665,2169-3218,,INDIANA LAW J,Indiana Law J.,WIN,2013,88,1,,,,,273,337,,,,,65,Law,Government & Law,091SP,WOS:000315070400005,,,,,2021-08-07,

Design/methodology/approach As a result, while the president's positions on educational reform are important, the question still remains; can the majority of Whites support an agenda coming from a Black president? Moreover, as a Black man, can the president really be allowed to be a representative of all of the people? Do many people think that the election of Mr. barna ushered in a postracial society; in that he is the living testament that we no longer need to focus on social justice, civil rights, and educational reform, especially for underperforming minority schools? Is race a factor among Whites and Blacks regarding President Obama's approval ratings? How much success can any president expect to have when a significant majority of the population is resistant to his vision of change? Findings - Based upon these lingering questions, the issue of race has been and will remain a factor in the barna presidency that no other president has had to contend. Obfuscation, control, and fear appear to be the raison d' tre regarding a strategy of resistance toward President barna and his interest in change. These are the reasons why President Obama's time is significantly spent on negotiating racial obstacles to change. Originality/value - The goal of this paper is to provide a sociological and psychological context within a historical framing to understand obstacles to change faced by President Barack Hussein barna.","[Smith, William A.] Univ Utah, Dept Educ Culture & Soc, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Smith, William A.] Univ Utah, Ethn Studies Program, African Amer Studies Div, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Smith, WA (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Educ Culture & Soc, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Smith, William A./P-6065-2016","Smith, William A./0000-0002-7941-2942",,,,24,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1479-358X,,978-1-78350-710-8; 978-1-78350-709-2,ADV EDUC DIVERS COMM,,,2014,10,,,,,,237,254,,10.1108/S1479-358X20130000010012,,,18,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BD1NJ,WOS:000358163600014,,,,,2021-08-07,

This is especially with the revival of extraction-oriented corporations, especially fossil fuel firms, which remain the world's most profitable. What opportunities arise for as multi-faceted a critique of extractivism as the conditions demand? With ongoing paralysis of United Nations climate negotiators, to illustrate, the most critical question for several decades to come is whether citizen activism can forestall further fossil fuel combustion. In many settings, the extractive industries are critical targets of climate activists, for example, where divestment of stocks is one strategy, or refusing access to land for mining is another. Invoking climate justice principles requires investigating the broader socio-ecological and economic costs and benefits of capital accumulation associated with fossil fuel use, through forceful questioning both by immediate victims and by all those concerned about GreenHouse Gas emissions. Their solidarity with each other is vital to nurture and to that end, the most powerful anti-corporate tactic developed so far, indeed beginning in South Africa during the anti-apartheid struggle, appears to be financial sanctions. The argumentation for invoking sanctions against the fossil fuel industry (and its enablers such as international shipping) is by itself insufficient. Also required is a solid activist tradition. There are, in 2014, two inter-related cases in which South African environmental justice activists have critiqued multi-billion dollar investments, and thus collided with the state, with two vast parastatal corporations and with their international financiers. Whether these collisions move beyond conflicting visions, and actually halt the fossilintensive projects, is a matter that can only be worked out both through argumentation - for example, in the pages below - and through gaining the solidarity required to halt the financing of climate change.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Civil Soc, Durban, South Africa","Bond, P (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Civil Soc, Durban, South Africa.",,"Bond, Patrick/N-5490-2013","Bond, Patrick/0000-0001-6657-7898",,,,69,4,4,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0161-7230,,978-1-78441-006-3; 978-1-78441-007-0,RES POLIT ECON,,,2014,29,,,,,,97,132,,10.1108/S0161-723020140000029004,10.1108/S0161-7230201429,,36,Economics,Business & Economics,BD1JP,WOS:000358071600005,,,,,2021-08-07,

These resources have come under increasing strain due to urban expansion, poor planning, and, more recently, climate change. Conflicts among uses and their underlying principles are increasingly adjudicated in courts, with the Ministerio Publico (Public Prosecutor's Office) acting as a key advocate for both human rights and environmental protection. As legal interventions become more common in policy questions, how are justice principles shaping emerging approaches to water governance? And how are these types of cases provoking a reconsideration of the role of law in public administration? This paper analyzes the justice ramifications of an increasing use of legal discourses and practices to adjudicate water-related conflicts in Sao Paulo. It also, and conversely, shows how legal battles over water and sanitation force a shift in the behavior and perspectives of legal actors, and subsequently broaden the meaning of 'justice.'","Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Haglund, L (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, POB 876402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",ladawn.haglund@asu.edu,,"Haglund, LaDawn/0000-0003-2283-1924",J.

This is largely a product of the dominant assessment techniques that are used to inform such strategies and the limits of existing evidence. In this paper I contribute to filling gaps in the current adaptation literature by exploring the social nature of vulnerability and the potential for socially just adaptation. It does so by reviewing studies from the UK, in particular those under the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Climate Change and Social Justice programme. It finds that vulnerability to high temperatures and fluvial and coastal flooding, in terms of sensitivity, exposure, and the capacity to anticipate, respond, and recover, is concentrated in certain disadvantaged and socially marginalized groups, including those on low incomes. It also finds that both autonomous and planned adaptation may fail to protect the most vulnerable individuals and groups, and may even reinforce existing patterns of vulnerability in some cases, i.e., mal-adaptation, especially where they rely on unmediated market forces or where they fail to explicitly recognize aspects of social vulnerability in their design and implementation. I argue that social justice should be an explicit objective of adaptation strategy.","Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden","Benzie, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,"Sida, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency","The author wishes to thank Sida, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, for support.",,39,12,12,2,19,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

The impacts of climate change are felt more intensely in communities that are dependent on natural resources. This is increasingly occurring through Arctic tourism, which is often based on nature, and is the foundation of the economy of many small Arctic communities. The interplay between tourism and community-based adaptation represents a significant focus in Arctic tourism studies and can bring invaluable information to governments about the local level climate change impacts on livelihoods and on the potential future challenges. The results from a vulnerability study conducted in two case study communities in Finnish Lapland indicate that both external and internal stresses, combined with the impacts of climate change, force the communities to reconsider their current development paths. The communities are still able to absorb the changes taking place in weather patterns, but the current development paths do not fully support the idea of sustainable adaptation, with its concepts of environmental integrity, social justice and participation. Though several adaptation strategies are deployed, future vulnerability may increase due to ineffective adaptation mechanisms and the increasing role of nature in tourism development.","Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland","Kajan, E (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Geog, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",eva.kajan@oulu.fi,,,,,,53,27,28,3,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1502-2250,1502-2269,,SCAND J HOSP TOUR,Scand.

Scholarly literature suggests that transnational civil society groups can help address problems of governance and injustice that cross borders and pit states against each other. Findings of a comparative, qualitative study of climate justice advocacy suggest, however, that civil society groups' work in the US and EU is significantly shaped by institutional factors specific to those regimes, limiting advocates' broader impact. Moreover, political opportunities for the pursuit of climate action, and justice particularly, have diminished in those settings. By contrast, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides greater opportunities for discussions of justice, although civil society actors are significantly constrained within it. It is argued that greater roles for civil society in the UNFCCC could prove constructive in the face of current challenges connected with justice issues. Three themes in civil society advocacy linking principles of global justice with current climate policy debates are summarized. Finally, it is suggested that the first iteration of the UNFCCC Periodic Review provides timely opportunities to more fully draw upon civil society's potential contributions toward a fair and effective global climate regime.Policy relevanceThe roles of civil society organizations in climate governance were examined in three policy contexts: the UNFCCC, the US, and the EU, with special attention to advocacy addressing issues of equity and justice, identified as key challenges for a post-2012 global agreement. Findings suggest that (1) civil society roles are significantly constrained in each context, and (2) political opportunities for climate advocacy have diminished since 2009 in the US and EU, underlining (3) the continued salience of the UNFCCC as a forum for engagement and the construction of effective and equitable climate policy. Potential exists for increased civil society involvement at the UNFCCC to help resolve obstacles based in divergent national priorities. Three areas of justice-focused civil society activity are reviewed for current negotiation topics and the governance structure of the institution. The current UNFCCC Periodic Review is identified as an opportunity to increase civil society involvement.","Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Derman, BB (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Box 353550, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",bderman@uw.edu,,,,,,65,21,21,0,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

However, some initiatives (e.g. the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme (REDD), and voluntary carbon markets (VCMs)) are already establishing multi-level governance structures that involve communities from developing countries in global mitigation efforts. This poses new equity and justice dilemmas: how the burdens and benefits of mitigation are shared across various levels and how host communities are positioned in multi-level governance structures. A review of the existing literature is used to distill a framework for distinguishing between four axes of climate justice from the perspective of communities. Empirical evidence from African and Asian carbon market projects is used to assess the distributive and procedural justice implications for host communities. The evidence suggests that host communities often benefit little from carbon market projects and find it difficult to protect their interests. Capacity building, attention to local power relations, supervision of business practices, promotion of projects with primarily development aims and an active involvement of non-state actors as bridges between local communities and the national/international levels could potentially contribute towards addressing some of the key justice concerns.Policy relevance International negotiations on the institutional frameworks that are envisaged to govern carbon markets are proceeding at a rather slow pace. As a consequence, host countries and private-sector actors are making their own arrangements to safeguard the interests of local communities. While several standards have emerged to guide carbon market activity on the ground, distributive as well as procedural justice concerns nevertheless remain salient. Four empirical case studies across Asia and Africa show that within the multi-scale and multi-actor carbon market governance, local-level actors often lack sufficient agency to advance their claims and protect their interests. This evidence suggests that ameliorating policy reforms are needed to enhance the positioning of local communities. Doing so is important to ensure future acceptability of carbon market activity in potential host communities as well as for ensuring their broader legitimacy.","[Mathur, Vivek N.; Afionis, Stavros; Paavola, Jouni; Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Mathur, VN (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",v.mathur@leeds.ac.uk,"Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X; Afionis, Stavros/0000-0002-0434-5108; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228; Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654; Mathur, Vivek Narain/0000-0003-3703-2121",Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,91,48,48,1,82,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

While this focus may translate into justice for future generations, there seems markedly less regard for justice for others in intragenerational space. I analyse the eco-building movement's framings of sustainable development and sustainability, seeking out statements of equity via the criteria used for building materials selection. Closely defining equity as theory and practice, analysis reveals that framings of sustainable development and sustainability in the eco-building movement vary considerably in their engagement with intragenerational equity. This begs the question of whether the movement has a shared political critique. There is a marked tendency to view discourses of environmental sustainability and social justice as distinct rather than mutually constitutive. I propose that the eco-building movement should engage in a politics of the common good (Sandel, 2010), contesting equity in the public domain. Wary of the reach of markets, the eco-building movement should debate not only the right way to distribute building materials and shelter but also the right way to value them.","Banc Y Mor, Aberystwyth SY23 4DW, Dyfed, Wales","Mason, K (corresponding author), Banc Y Mor, Aberystwyth SY23 4DW, Dyfed, Wales.",kelvin.john.mason@gmail.com,,,,,,71,4,4,0,12,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Building on the ethical urgency of the environmental justice movement, this essay offers a feminist reading of Jewish narratives from the Babylonian Talmud that centers attention on issues of power, privilege, and social inequality in the midst of disaster. Talmudic tales of the destruction of Jerusalem critique the moral oblivion of wealthy residents who failed to act in response to crisis. Articulating a Jewish feminist reconstituative ethics, the author uses these tales to trace the ethical costs of epistemologies of ignorance-the complex strategies and social processes through which privileged communities cultivate ignorance of environmental suffering, maintain social distance from environmental risk, and disown moral culpability for environmental injustice.","Georgetown Univ, Dept Theol, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Belser, JW (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Theol, Box 571135,New North 120, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",jwb84@georgetown.edu,,,,,,70,7,7,0,4,SOC CHRISTIAN ETHICS,COLLEGEVILLE,"ST JOHN'S UNIV, SCHOOL THEOLOGY-SEMINARY, PO BOX 50370, COLLEGEVILLE, MN 56321-5633 USA",1540-7942,2326-2176,,J SOC CHRIST ETHICS,J.

In this paper, we argue that it is both productive and necessary to examine how climate justice is being pursued at the urban scale, which brings into focus the need for attention to issues of recognition as well as rights and responsibilities. Building on work from environmental justice, which has conceptualized justice as trivalent, we propose that climate justice can be understood as a pyramid, the faces of which are distributions, procedures, rights, responsibilities and recognition. We then apply this conceptual framework to examine climate change interventions in five cities; Bangalore, Monterrey, Hong Kong, Philadelphia and Berlin. Arguing that the politics and practices of urban climate change interventions are constantly engaging with and refracting the idea of justice, we examine how justice was articulated, practiced and contested across our cases. The perspective of recognition emerges as a particularly useful entry point through which to explore the types of rights, responsibilities, distributions and procedures required to respond justly to climate change. We conclude by reflecting on our framework, arguing that it is useful both as an analytical device to interrogate climate justice and to shape the design of climate change interventions which seek to ensure climate justice.

However, what happens when a movement explicitly aims at repoliticizing the present in an attempt to open a space for change? Combining scholar activism with theoretical insights from post-foundational political theorists, such as Jacques Ranciere, Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau, this paper studies the paradoxical nature of the attempt to repoliticize climate change by Climate Justice Action (CJA), a grassroots movement that was set up before the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009. Comparing different repoliticization strategies, the paper shows how CJA exhibits core features of a Rancierian political act, which makes visible what was previously invisible by starting from the postulate of equality. However, lacking an elaborate perspective on alternatives, both Ranciere and CJA appear to be stuck in the present. Drawing on Mouffe and Laclau's discourse theory, the paper subsequently analyzes the nodal points of CJA's discourse that could function as inscription points for alternatives. Yet, these points appear to primarily intensify a we/them distinction. The result is a paradox: to create a space for imagining alternative futures, one must first fight post-political representations of the present. However, when politicization becomes an end in itself, the outreach of the movement, and therefore its capacity to repoliticize and stimulate the imagination of alternative futures, is constrained.

This paper presents original qualitative and quantitative data to document how transnational activism on climate change has changed over time. The author draws attention to the role of transnational social movement spillover-a process by which ideas, activists, and tactics are diffused from one movement to another-in explaining this evolution. The article examines the spillover of the global justice movement to the climate justice movement from 2007 to 2009, linking this spillover to changes in the nature of activism. In contrast to previous approaches, this work shows that transnational social movement spillover can result in the expansion of contention without radicalizing those actors already involved. This case demonstrates the theoretical importance of the spillover process and offers lessons for future climate activism.","Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Hadden, J (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,63,37,37,0,23,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1526-3800,1536-0091,,GLOBAL ENVIRON POLIT,Glob.

While most discussions of climate justice in the academic literature focus on ideal conceptions and normative arguments of justice theory, or on the pragmatic policy of the more elite environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), a distinct discourse has developed out of the grassroots. In these movement articulations of climate justice, the concerns and principles of environmental justice are clear and consistent. Here, climate justice focuses on local impacts and experience, inequitable vulnerabilities, the importance of community voice, and demands for community sovereignty and functioning. This review traces the discourse of environmental justice from its development, through the range of principles and demands of grassroots climate justice movements, to more recent articulations of ideas for just adaptation to climate change.

While the policy of both Wales and UK governments commits them to cutting carbon emissions to mitigate climate change and so to increasing the percentage of electricity derived from renewable energy sources, political support for windfarms vacillates and there is vociferous public opposition. Taking landscape as our organising concept, we analyse the 62 turbine, approximately 155 Megawatt Nant y Moch proposal in Ceredigion. We ask how landscape is represented in pro and anti-windfarm discourses and how reconsideration of landscape might lead to alternative constructions of justice. We thus develop a notion of 'landscape justice' which blends elements of deontological, virtue and consequentialist ethics, and argue for: (i) a deeper appreciation of the exclusion of 'other' voices in deciding outcomes; (ii) a heightened awareness that how public space is created and how arguments are made, received and facilitated therein is critically important to just outcomes; (iii) a renewed interest in how landscape, wind and energy ought to be valued; (iv) an understanding that, although justice with respect to landscape may be irresolvable across space and time, that arguments may be incommensurable, this pluralistic limit can be celebrated.

Former uses of these properties range from heavy industry to residential neighborhoods, and each bears many potential legacies of past uses, including: introduction of contaminants that may threaten the health of humans and other species, engineering of land and infrastructure that may undermine hydrological ecosystem services, and introduction of species including invasives. While the ecological functions that characterize vacant urban lands have been only partially investigated, the legacies associated with their past uses are known to affect ecosystem services. In addition, changed industries, weakened economies, arcane financial systems, population migration, and aging resident populations have left many people living in the midst of this vacancy, with clear implications for human health and safety. Since market demand is weak in highly vacant districts, social capital may be particularly important to protecting quality of life and ecosystem services. New design and planning approaches should be informed by urban ecological knowledge that is synthesized with social and cultural understanding of residents' perceptions and values. Interest in urban agriculture, green infrastructure, and open space planning for vacant urban lands is burgeoning. However, without adequate knowledge of highly vacant districts as socio-ecological systems, design and planning may have unintended consequences for human health, water quality, adaptation to climate change, and a panoply of other ecosystem services. Research questions and design and planning applications require a transdisciplinary approach to address highly vacant urban districts with legitimacy and relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Advocates of this approach blame climate change on a civilizational crisis that is fundamentally a crisis of modern Enlightenment reason. Certain Latin American feminists and indigenous women, however, question the implications, for women, of any proposed civilizational shift seeking to reverse the human separation from nonhuman nature wrought via Enlightenment's disenchantment of nature. The paper argues that, in order to adequately address both the climate crisis and feminist concerns about buen vivir, a different critique of Enlightenment modernity is necessary-one drawing on Adorno's philosophy of negative dialectics and on Adorno and Horkheimer's nonidentitarian dialectical understanding of Enlightenment. Conceiving Enlightenment as composed of nonsublatable moments of domination and liberation, Adorno and Horkheimer call for a rational critique of reason and for affinity rather than identity with nonhuman nature. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how feminist critiques of buen vivir and approaches to climate justice can be furthered via an engagement with an environmental feminist philosophy informed by a negative dialectical approach to Enlightenment.","Univ Calgary, Fac Arts, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Cochrane, R (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Arts, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",r.cochrane@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,49,12,12,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-5367,1527-2001,,HYPATIA,Hypatia,SUM,2014,29,3,,,SI,,576,598,,10.1111/hypa.12099,,,23,Philosophy; Women's Studies,Philosophy; Women's Studies,AN5YS,WOS:000340669600004,,,,,2021-08-07,

Next, we develop an illustrative case study of Canada's worst rail catastrophe. In so doing, we provide evidence of a decades-long failure of US and Canadian regulators to prevent such disasters. We interpret that disaster through a human rights case law suggesting that States have an affirmative duty to protect their citizens from foreseeable disasters. Based on this analysis, we propose specific rail safety regulatory reforms. We argue that if the US and Canadian governments implement these regulations as required under human rights law, they can more effectively honor their obligations to their citizens who are paying a high human cost for the material benefits associated with increased energy production.","[Burton, Lloyd; Stretesky, Paul] Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, Program Concentrat Environm Policy Management & L, Denver, CO 80202 USA","Burton, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, Program Concentrat Environm Policy Management & L, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",Lloyd.Burton@ucdenver.edu,"Stretesky, Paul B./W-3850-2017","Stretesky, Paul B./0000-0001-5927-1882",,,,35,4,5,0,26,HARVARD UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"79 GARDEN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",1079-0969,2150-4113,,HEALTH HUM RIGHTS,Health Hum.

Understanding the complex interplay of climatic and socioeconomic trends is imperative to protect human health and lessen the burden of diseases such as dengue fever. Dengue fever is rapidly expanding globally. Temperature, rainfall, and frequency of natural disasters, as well as non-climatic trends involving population growth and migration, urbanization, and international trade and travel, are expected to increase the prevalence of mosquito breeding sites, mosquito survival, the speed of mosquito reproduction, the speed of viral incubation, the distribution of dengue virus and its vectors, human migration patterns towards urban areas, and displacement after natural disasters. The burden of dengue disproportionately affects the poor due to increased environmental risk and decreased health care. Mobilization of social institutions is needed to improve the structural inequalities of poverty that predispose the poor to increased dengue fever infection and worse outcomes. This paper reviews the link between dengue and climatic factors as a starting point to developing a comprehensive understanding of how climate change affects dengue risk and how institutions can address the issues of social justice and dengue outbreaks that increasingly affect vulnerable urban populations.","[Chang, Aileen Y.; Carrasquillo, Olveen] Univ Miami, Dept Gen Internal Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Fuller, Douglas O.] Univ Miami, Coll Arts & Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Beier, John C.] Univ Miami, Miami, FL USA","Chang, AY (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Gen Internal Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",achang@med.miami.edu,,"Chang, Aileen/0000-0001-7410-9867",,,,89,15,15,0,49,HARVARD UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"79 GARDEN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",1079-0969,2150-4113,,HEALTH HUM RIGHTS,Health Hum.

We begin by situating our discussion in the wider climate discourse, particularly with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Basel Convention. We then suggest that many of the most attractive technological solutions to climate change, such as solar energy and electric car batteries, will likely add to the rapidly growing stream of electronic waste (e-waste). This e-waste may have negative downstream effects on otherwise disenfranchised populations. We argue that e-waste burdens women unfairly and disproportionately, affecting their mortality/morbidity and fertility, as well as the development of their children. Building on this, we claim that these injustices are more accurately captured as problems of recognition rather than distribution, since women are often institutionally under-acknowledged both in the workplace and in the home. Without institutional support and representation, women and children are deprived of adequate safety equipment, health precautions, and health insurance. Finally, we return to the question of climate justice in the context of the human right to health and argue for greater inclusion and recognition of women waste workers and other disenfranchised groups in forging future climate agreements.","[McAllister, Lucy; Magee, Amanda; Hale, Benjamin] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Grad Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hale, Benjamin] Univ Colorado, Dept Philosophy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","McAllister, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Environm Studies Program, 1333 Grandview Ave,UCB 488, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",mcallisl@colorado.edu,,"McAllister, Lucy/0000-0003-4876-8388",,,,60,7,7,0,33,HARVARD UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"79 GARDEN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",1079-0969,2150-4113,,HEALTH HUM RIGHTS,Health Hum.

The lack of political science expertise and research represents an obstacle for adapting to climate change, because adaptation is fundamentally political. Technical advances in adaptations for infrastructure, agriculture, public health, coastal protection, conservation, and other fields all depend on political variables for their implementation and effectiveness. For example, adaptation raises questions about political economy (adaptation costs money), political theory (adaptation involves questions of social justice), comparative politics (some countries more aggressively pursue adaptation), urban politics (some cities more aggressively pursue adaptation), regime type (democracies and authoritarian regimes may differently pursue adaptation), federalism (different levels of government may be involved), and several other fields of study including political conflict, international development, bureaucracy, migration, media, political parties, elections, civil society, and public opinion.

Arguably, the resulting ecological econophysics will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the world's population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic system's architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.","Inst Catala Ciencies Clima IC3, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain","Pueyo, S (corresponding author), Inst Catala Ciencies Clima IC3, C Doctor Trueta 203, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain.",spueyo@ub.edu,,,,,,210,9,9,0,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2014,6,6,,,,,3431,3483,,10.3390/su6063431,,,53,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AK9LF,WOS:000338747900016,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

Struggles over identity politics, especially the strategic articulation and deployment of particular identities at diverse geographical scales, have recently emerged as important mediators of justice claims in respect of resources rights, but also of recognition and procedural justice. To date, critical, multi-scalar analyses of identity-based claims for environmental justice have focused largely on the indigenous peoples' movement. In doing so, they have failed to embrace an emergent dimension of identity-based, trans-scalar justice, namely the fledgling global pastoralists' movement, the empirical focus for this paper. In the early years of the 21st century mobile pastoralists have begun to carve out new global spaces, through which diverse groups have attempted to negotiate common ground and forge common identities in their struggles for justice. In particular, mobile pastoralists have become increasingly visible in conservation politics and contests over land rights as they lay claim to both discursive and material ground as 'custodians of the commons' in an era of global climatic change. This paper draws on empirical work amongst pastoralists, NGOs and activists from Kenya, Mongolia and Spain to explore these identities, their implications for resource rights and access and the multi-scalar chains of accountability and legitimacy between global activists and their local constituents.

These distinctions, however, often fail to acknowledge the diverse experience of climate risks, or the contested nature of many proposed solutions. This paper argues for a reassessment of debates about climate justice based upon a greater diversity of risks and solutions such as integrating the reduction of social vulnerability simultaneously with mitigation. In effect, this implies reassessing the implicit use of Rawls' model of justice as fair allocation of predefined risks and solutions, and instead considering Sen's understanding of justice as inclusive debate about which risks require which solutions.

Despite the importance of allergenic pollen to public health, no research has linked land use and plant populations to spatial heterogeneity in airborne pollen concentrations. In order to quantify these relationships and elucidate the processes which lead to pollen exposure, we surveyed ragweed stem density in Detroit (Michigan, USA) as a function of land use. We then deployed 34 pollen collectors throughout the city and recorded ragweed cover in the immediate vicinity of each pollen collector. We found that ragweed populations were highest in vacant lots, a common land cover type in Detroit. Because ragweed population density was so strongly correlated to vacant lots, for which spatially explicit data were available, we were able to investigate whether observed ragweed pollen concentrations were a function of land use at the spatial scales of 10 m and I km. Both relationships were significant, and the combination of these two variables predicts a large portion of airborne ragweed pollen concentrations (R-2 = 0.48). These results emphasize the important role of pollen production within the urban environment and show that management of allergenic pollen producing plants must be considered at multiple spatial scales. Our findings also demonstrate that there is too much spatial heterogeneity for a pollen collector at any given site to portray the allergenic pollen load experienced by different individuals within the same city. Finally, we discuss how spatial correlations between socio-economic status, vacant lots, and ragweed could help to explain the disproportionate amount of allergies and ragweed sensitization experienced bylaw income and minority populations in Detroit.

Given the global population explosion and increase in wealth, there is an increased demand for foods of animal origin. Environmental data are rapidly accumulating on the unsustainability of current worldwide food consumption practices that are high in meat and dairy products. Natural nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce, and environmental degradation is rapidly increasing. At the current trends of food consumption and environmental changes, food security and food sustainability are on a collision course. Changing course (to avoid the collision) will require extreme downward shifts in meat and dairy consumption by large segments of the world's population. Other approaches such as food waste reduction and precision agriculture and/or other technological advances have to be simultaneously pursued; however, they are insufficient to make the global food system sustainable. For millennia, meatless diets have been advocated on the basis of values, and large segments of the world population have thrived on plant-based diets. Going back to plant-based diets worldwide seems to be a reasonable alternative for a sustainable future. Policies in favor of the global adoption of plant-based diets will simultaneously optimize the food supply, health, environmental, and social justice outcomes for the world's population.

This principle constitutes a claim of inter-generational justice, and it is widely believed that the non-identity problem raises serious difficulties for any such claim. After briefly sketching the rationale behind 'beneficiary pays,' this paper offers a new way of understanding the claim that persons in developed societies have benefited from industrialization. It argues that when we think of the claim in this new way, it evades the non-identity problem entirely. Some objections to this approach are then considered and rebutted.

There are many pathways from urban environments to human health. Numerous links have been described but some underlying mechanisms behind these relationships are less understood. Combining theory and methods is a way of understanding and explaining how the underlying structures of urban environments relate to public health and social equity. This paper proposes a model for an ecological public health, which can be used to explore these relationships. Four principles of an ecological public health-conviviality, equity, sustainability and global responsibility-are used to derive theoretical concepts that can inform ecological public health thinking, which, among other things, provides a way of exploring the underlying mechanisms that link urban environments to public health and social equity. Theories of more-thanhuman agency inform ways of living together (conviviality) in urban areas. Political ecology links the equity concerns about environmental and social justice. Resilience thinking offers a better way of coming to grips with sustainability. Integrating ecological ethics into public health considers the global consequences of local urban living and thus attends to global responsibility. This way of looking at the relationships between urban environments, public health and social equity answers the call to craft an ecological public health for the twenty-first century by re-imagining public health in a way that acknowledges humans as part of the ecosystem, not separate from it, though not central to it.","[Bentley, Michael] Flinders Univ S Australia, Southgate Inst Hlth, Soc & Equ, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Bentley, Michael] Univ Tasmania, Australia & Sch Med, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Bentley, M (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Southgate Inst Hlth, Soc & Equ, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",michael.bentley@flinders.edu.au,"Bentley, Michael W/J-2804-2013","Bentley, Michael W/0000-0003-3016-6194",,,,97,19,20,2,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0957-4824,1460-2245,,HEALTH PROMOT INT,Health Promot.

The western North Pacific is the area of the world with the most intense tropical cyclones. Increased sea surface temperatures directly contribute to the wind speed of storms. The 2013 Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan was the strongest tropical cyclone in recorded history to make landfall-causing more than 6000 deaths in the Philippines, mostly from storm surge. This event represents a climate injustice. On one hand, disaster prevention and preparedness were inadequate for impoverished populations in the Philippines who lived in poorly constructed housing. While the international community assisted with the response, recovery was hampered by inadequate and inequitable investment.

Those who call for climate justice argue for more robust measures to control carbon emissions responsible for climate change and worsening global health security.

Our study utilizes 2010 MODIS and Landsat medium-resolution, remotely sensed thermal data, census socio-demographic information, and both conventional and spatial statistical methods. Results indicate that LST is significantly greater in census tracts characterized by higher percentages of certain racial/ethnic minorities and higher poverty rates, even after controlling for contextual factors and the effects of spatial autocorrelation.

In the spirit of Lord Dahrendorf, this paper represents the output of interdisciplinary collaboration and integrates state-of-the-art academic expertise from the fields of philosophy, economics and governance. Our focus is on Europe, which is widely perceived as a leader in climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, leadership weakness on climate over recent years, largely due to recession and political vacillation, is eroding this perception. What is needed is a firm justification for strong climate action, acknowledgement of the available tools, awareness of the reasons for our failures to date, and a realistic, but goal-oriented strategy for an integrated climate policy. We therefore present current normative insights from climate justice research highlighting the need to make institutions responsive to those most vulnerable; we discuss the economics of the transition to a low-carbon economy, pointing to key policy instruments and post-2020 climate targets for the EU; we contrast the normative and quantitative synoptic principles with the particularistic implementation schemes and politics of (not) implementing measures on the ground; and we suggest a careful coordination of European climate policies with acute challenges that could increase both climate justice and political feasibility.","[Creutzig, Felix] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Hedahl, Marcus] US Naval Acad, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Rydge, James] Global Green Growth Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Szulecki, Kacper] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",,"Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016; Szulecki, Kacper/H-1237-2013; Szulecki, Kacper/AAM-6587-2021","Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348; Szulecki, Kacper/0000-0002-1835-3758; Szulecki, Kacper/0000-0002-1835-3758",,,,54,6,6,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1758-5880,1758-5899,,GLOB POLICY,Glob.

Since 2012 the Coalition Government has created key economic drivers to encourage shale exploration, whilst growing activism in affected site communities has stirred significant media and academic commentary. This study examines the growing national debate as a matter of discourse, adopting an argumentative discourse analytic approach to assess data collected from stakeholder interviews (n=21) and key policy actor statements quoted in broadsheet newspapers. We explore three dominant storylines emerging in relation to shale gas policy: (1) cleanliness and dirt concerns the relative framing of the environmental benefits and harms of shale gas; (2) energy transitions - pathways and diversions concerns geographic metaphors of transitions to carbon intensive and low-carbon energy systems; and (3) geographies of environmental justice concerns divisions of economic benefit distribution, environmental impact and procedural fairness. We find that central government policy rhetoric emphasises economic development, regulatory oversight and distribution of benefits to site communities, whilst minimising discussion of the implications of shale gas for anthropogenic climate change. The role of these discourses in influencing shale gas policy is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Though grandfathering appears to have been influential in actual emission control frameworks, it is rarely taken seriously by philosophers. This article presents an argument for thinking this an oversight. The core of the argument is that members of countries with higher historical emissions are typically burdened with higher costs when transitioning to a Oven lower level of emissions. According to several appealing views in political philosophy (utilitarianism, egalitarianism, prioritarianism and sufficientarianism) they are therefore entitled to greater resources, including emission entitlements, than those in similar positions but with lower emissions. This grandfathering may play an especially important role in allocating emission entitlements among rich countries.","[Knight, Carl] Univ Glasgow, Dept Polit, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland; [Knight, Carl] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Polit, Johannesburg, South Africa","Knight, C (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Polit, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland.",carl.knight@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Knight, Carl/0000-0002-6093-2868",,,,61,14,14,0,4,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

To date, climate policy analysis has mostly considered women as agents of climate protection, that is, objects of mitigation policies, rather than subjects in their own right. However, climate change mitigation involves direct and indirect distributive effects depending on which sectors are involved, which instruments are chosen and how funds are obtained and allocated. Since gender roles impact on individual livelihoods and activities, distributive effects are likely to be gendered. This paper suggests that women's human rights can be used as a framework for research aiming to fill this gap. They provide a well-developed, tested range of criteria for gender justice. Such assessments would allow for a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the gendered distributive effects of climate policies, notably with regard to the particularly understudied situation in the industrialized world.","Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Bendlin, L (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",lena.bendlin@fu-berlin.de,,"Bendlin, Lena/0000-0003-0004-0953",,,,129,12,12,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0955-7571,1474-449X,,CAMB REV INT AFF,Camb.

Reducing vulnerability to cope with climate variability might be more challenging in tropical countries than in North America or Europe. The ten papers of this special issue were presented during the Adaptclim conference that was held by the Sinergia Project, the CLARIS LPB project, and the GeoData Institute in Asuncin, Paraguay, in 2010. All papers, except one regarding the Brahmaputra Basin in South Asia, present studies from South America. These studies are first contextualized geographically and then are related one to another by a simplified vulnerability concept linking climate stress to sensitivity and adaptive capacity of natural and human systems. One half of the papers focus on actual or future climate change and the present-day causes of the vulnerability of natural and agrosystems. Droughts are and will be the main source of stress for agriculture in South America. Increasing fragmentation of forest of the center of this continent is aggravating their vulnerability to dry spells. Another half of the studies of this special issue deal with the adaptive capacity human populations to system perturbations produced or enhanced by climate change. The studies point out inclusion of traditional knowledge and involvement of local actors in their own vulnerability assessment to increase adaptive capacity. These elements of climate justice, giving voice to those less responsible for carbon emissions but bearing their most severe consequences, allow the particular needs of a community to be considered and can direct adaptation policy toward preserving or rebuilding their specific capabilities under threat from climate change. The special issue also made clear that a basin analysis of the climate change problem could provide information, results, and methods more readily of use for the local population and decision makers.","[Girard, Pierre] Fed Univ Mato Grosso Brazil, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso, Brazil; [Girard, Pierre] Pantanal Res Ctr CPP, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso, Brazil; [Boulanger, Jean-Philippe] Climate Risk Management Solut, ECOCLIMASOL, Paris, France; [Hutton, Craig] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm Acad Unit, GeoData Inst, Southampton, Hants, England","Girard, P (corresponding author), Fed Univ Mato Grosso Brazil, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso, Brazil.",pierregirard1301@gmail.com,"Girard, Pierre/D-6038-2013","Girard, Pierre/0000-0002-8411-0690; Hutton, Craig/0000-0002-5896-756X",Pantanal Research Center (CPP); Brazilian Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCTI); Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada; WWF-Brazil; TNC,"We wish to thank the Pantanal Research Center (CPP), the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCT&I), and the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq), as well as Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, WWF-Brazil, and TNC for supporting the Sinergia project and the Adpatclim conference.

In order to examine the institutional achievements and challenges for managing the region, a specific typology is initially introduced, which comprises a schematic gradient of institutional responses. An empirical analysis was conducted in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, the three countries that share the Pantanal, which identified the hybrid basis of the policy framework under construction, in the sense that it actually combines elements of various institutional responses included in the proposed typology. Important factors that seem to undermine the efficacy of institutional responses in addressing climate change in the region are the strong influence of the agribusiness sector and the still relatively low importance of the Pantanal for national environmental policy-making.

Taking into account values and perceptions of affected actors and decision-makers is a fundamental and necessary prerequisite for a more effective, legitimate and fair climate policy and has not been given the necessary consideration. This paper uses Q methodology to explore such values in the context of climate change in the Ebro Delta, in Catalonia. The delta is an area highly vulnerable to climate change, mainly because of its topography, but also as a result of human intervention. The study identifies five discourses on vulnerability and adaptation held by delta inhabitants and decision-makers. Social justice and security comprise shared values behind arguments; however, discourses differ in their approaches concerning the proper scale for applying these values with adaptation policy. Our results serve to improve policy dialogue and suggest that the adaptation policy agenda should focus on pursuing consensus over the crucial issue of scale. Our use of Q methodology to advance the incipient literature on value-based climate change vulnerability and adaptation is innovative and suggests that the approach has a capacity to contribute to advancing deliberative environmental decision-making on adaptation.

People living in highly industrialized countries share a way of life that comes with high levels of emissions. Their expectations to be able to continue their projects imply their holding expectations to similarly high future levels of personal emissions. We argue that the frustration or undermining of these expectations would cause them significant harm. Further, the article investigates under what conditions people can be thought to hold legitimate expectations, in particular about permissible levels of future emissions. We distinguish differing theories of understanding these conditions, namely authority-based and justice-based theories, that each allows us to systematically distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate expectations. Furthermore, with respect to individuals' future permissible emissions we give several reasons for holding that such theories cannot identify a particular expectation to a specific level of personal emissions as the only legitimate one. Finally, we argue that the set of legitimate expectations that people hold with respect to a just and effective solution to climate change has normative significance in at least two ways: the differing but equally legitimate expectations ought to be taken into account when justifying what could count as such a solution and when determining the just way of arriving at and implementing such a solution.","[Meyer, Lukas H.] Graz Univ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Meyer, Lukas H.; Sanklecha, Pranay] Graz Univ, Dept Philosophy, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Meyer, LH (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Dept Philosophy, Attemsgasse 25-2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",lukas.meyer@uni-graz.at; pranay.sanklecha@uni-graz.at,"Meyer, Lukas H/L-3740-2016","Meyer, Lukas H/0000-0001-5845-6084",,,,38,12,12,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1470-594X,1741-3060,,POLIT PHILOS ECON,Polit.

There are many environmental grievances, extensive resources available to potential social movements, and a broadly favourable political opportunity structure. On the other hand, prominent environmental organisations have faced a number of limits, obstacles and challenges that have prevented the formation of a strong, unified and popular 'green' movement. Movements on land, housing, and service delivery, however, have thrived in comparison, and, while they tend not to self-identify as environmental movements, they should be regarded as important elements of broader progressive environmental struggles in South Africa. Consumption may also become a powerful framing issue for environmental justice movements, and its relevance to contemporary South Africa is illustrated through a controversial township youth phenomenon known as 'pexing'.

We assessed the role of public health and social justice in European climate change adaptation using a three-fold approach: a document analysis, a critical discourse analysis of a subgroup of strategies, and a ranking of strategies against our social justice framework. The ranking approach favored planning that includes various adaptation types, social issues and infrastructure changes. Themes on values identified in the five subgroup documents showed that risks are perceived as contradictory, technology is viewed as savior, responsibilities need to be negotiated, and social justice is advocated by only a few countries. Of 21 strategy documents assessed overall, those from Austria, England and Sweden received the highest scores in the ranking. Our qualitative assessment showed that in European adaptation planning, progress could still be made through community involvement into adaptation decisions, consistent consideration of social and demographic determinants, and a stronger link between infrastructural adaptation and the health sector. Overall, a social justice framework can serve as an evaluation guideline for adaptation policy documents.","[Boeckmann, Melanie; Zeeb, Hajo] Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol BIPS, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Boeckmann, Melanie] Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Boeckmann, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol BIPS, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, Achterstr 30, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",melanie.boeckmann@bips.uni-bremen.de; zeeb@bips.uni-bremen.de,"Zeeb, Hajo/I-2701-2019","Boeckmann, Melanie/0000-0001-5909-5508; Zeeb, Hajo/0000-0001-7509-242X",University of Bremen; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology-BIPS,This study was partially supported by a University of Bremen and Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology-BIPS joint dissertation scholarship for Melanie Boeckmann.

First, constructing a capital infrastructure in the South in a manner that maximises the potential for decarbonisation would tend to be very import-intensive. Hence, it would require external financing or else risk running aground through balance of payment constraints. Second, there is already a tendency in the global economy of siphoning resources from South to North, in particular through the increasing control over flows of value and wealth by Northern corporations from their commanding positions within international networks. Southern productivity needs to be contextualised from this perspective given the risk that climate negotiations lock in the subordination of Southern countries within these global networks, rather than seeking ways for Southern producers to leverage more value for the output and carbon emissions they are already producing. Third, population and labour transitions in the South place relatively greater pressure than in the past on employment generation in tertiary (service) sectors, in which distributive and redistributive processes play essential roles in bolstering labour demand. The neglect of global redistribution could undermine the capacity of Southern countries to face these broader development challenges, which are already immense even in the absence of decarbonisation. A key question is how to organise global redistributive transfers in a manner that does not continue to subordinate Southern populations to Northern interests. The challenge for decarbonisation is the forging of a political will for redistribution that is motivated by climate change rather than geopolitics, and that respects national ownership and self-determination.","[Fischer, Andrew Martin] Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies The Hague, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands","Fischer, AM (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",fischer@iss.nl,,,,,,23,2,2,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We describe the unique challenges that environmental justice communities face with evacuation, and identify best practice guidelines to improve the quality of evacuation planning for these communities. The guidelines presented, while not comprehensive, provide a framework for planners and policymakers to consider when developing evacuation plans, both for current and future climate conditions, and could improve the quality of evacuation planning.","[Kuhl, Laura] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Kirshen, Paul H.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Res Grp, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kirshen, Paul H.] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ruth, Matthias] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ruth, Matthias] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Douglas, Ellen M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA","Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",laura.kuhl@tufts.edu; paul.kirshen@unh.edu; m.ruth@neu.edu; ellen.douglas@umb.edu,,"Kuhl, Laura/0000-0002-1379-9435",NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP) [NAO08OAR4310722]; NSF research grant IGERT: Water Diplomacy [0966093]; BP,"This research was funded by grants from the NOAA Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP; NAO08OAR4310722), NSF research grant 0966093 IGERT: Water Diplomacy, and a research grant from BP to the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy at the Fletcher School.",,87,5,5,2,76,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

By adopting a carbocentric approach,'' we show that mangrove forests are strong candidates for PES projects. They are particularly well suited to the generation of carbon credits because of their unrivaled potential as carbon sinks, their resistance and resilience to natural hazards, and their extensive provision of Ecosystem Services other than carbon sequestration, primarily nursery areas for fish, water purification and coastal protection, to the benefit of local communities as well as to the global population. The voluntary carbon market provides opportunities for the development of appropriate protocols and good practice case studies for mangroves at a small scale, and these may influence larger compliance schemes in the future. Mangrove habitats are mostly located in developing countries on communally or state-owned land. This means that issues of national and local governance, land ownership and management, and environmental justice are the main challenges that require careful planning at the early stages of mangrove PES projects to ensure successful outcomes and equitable benefit sharing within local communities.","[Locatelli, Tommaso; Patenaude, Genevieve] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Binet, Thomas] Univ Portsmouth, Ctr Econ Aquat Resources, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Kairo, James Gitundu] Kenya Marine & Fisheries Res, Nairobi, Kenya; [King, Lesley] LTS Int, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Upton, Caroline] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Huxham, Mark] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Life Sport & Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Locatelli, T (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",t.locatelli@sms.ed.ac.uk; thomas.binet@port.ac.uk; gkairo@yahoo.com; lesley-king@ltsi.co.uk; s.madden@talktalk.net; genevieve.patenaude@ed.ac.uk; cu5@leicester.ac.uk; m.huxham@napier.ac.uk,"Huxham, Mark/D-4427-2015; Patenaude, Genevieve/F-3115-2010","Huxham, Mark/0000-0001-7877-6675; Patenaude, Genevieve/0000-0001-7552-7470; James, Kairo/0000-0001-8325-2550","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation Programme (ESPA) [NE/I002952/1, NE/I003401/1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I002952/1, 1118918, NE/I003401/1] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was funded with support from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation Programme (ESPA, Grant numbers NE/I002952/1 and NE/I003401/1).

We conducted analysis in six REDD + countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam). The paper combines three methods: policy analysis, media-based discourse analysis and policy network analysis. The paper shows that policies both within and outside the forestry sector that support deforestation and forest degradation create path dependencies and entrenched interests that hamper policy change. In addition, most dominant policy coalitions do not challenge business-as-usual trajectories, reinforcing existing policy and political structures. No minority policy coalitions are directly tackling the root causes of deforestation and forest degradation, that is, the politico-economic conditions driving them. Instead they focus on environmental justice issues, such as calls for increased participation of indigenous people in decision-making. Only in two of the six countries are these transformational change coalitions vocal enough to be heard, yet to exercise their agency effectively and to support more substantial reforms, these coalitions would need the participation of more influential policy actors, particularly state agencies that have the authority to make binding decisions about policy. Furthermore, discourses supporting transformational change would need to be reflected in institutional practices and policy decisions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In many countries, water security disparities are evident among households in the same community. The consequences of low water security are well documented, including morbidity, mortality, financial hardship, and social conflict. However, the social determinants of water security are less understood, particularly in urban areas of developing countries. This study uses a mixed methods approach with a focus on household resources in an urban Philippine community to address 2 aims. First, the study examines the association of financial, physical, and social resources with 4 water security measures: consumption, perceived cleanliness, perceived ease, and affordability. Second, the study examines ways in which households acquire and use financial, physical, and social resources to improve water security. Data are from randomly sampled household surveys (N = 396) and purposively sampled in-depth interviews (n = 18). Results of multiple regression analysis show income is positively associated with reported consumption and affordability of water; water storage capacity is positively associated with reported consumption and perceived cleanliness, but negatively associated with affordability; and having a household connection to the municipal utility is positively associated with reported consumption, perceived cleanliness, perceived ease, and affordability. Qualitative results shed light on the challenges to water access, and the role of social resources in improving water security. Findings can inform social programs and policies to improve equitable distribution of water-related resources among households.","[Mason, Lisa Reyes] Univ Tennessee, Coll Social Work, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Mason, LR (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, 321 Henson Hall,1618 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",lmason12@utk.edu,,"Mason, Lisa/0000-0001-5386-4425",,,,55,11,11,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2334-2315,1948-822X,,J SOC SOC WORK RES,J.

As Simon Caney rightly points out, the key issues of climate justice are too closely interconnected with wider concerns about global justice to be meaningfully addressed in isolation. Nonetheless, this chapter argues that Caney's proposal must not be understood as ruling out all single-issue research. Questions of climate justice display a unique degree of complexity stemming from intersecting with questions not only of global justice but also of intergenerational justice, the normative challenges of acting under uncertainty, responsibility (and liability) of individuals, states, corporate agents and unorganized collectives, institutional design, the differences between ideal and non-ideal theorizing, and the role of empirical evidence in moral reasoning. Given such complexity it is often advisable to limit the focus on single issues and explore each dimension in isolation first in order to get the details right. This chapter therefore proposes to understand the project of climate justice as a cooperative venture with research focusing on analyzing the particular dynamics of single issues, as well as research linking these findings with the wider debates of global justice.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Zellentin, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Zellentin, Alexa/AAL-6084-2021",,,,,19,3,3,0,0,ROUTLEDGE,ABINGDON,"2 PARK SQ, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORD, ENGLAND",,,978-0-415-51753-9; 978-0-203-12380-5; 978-0-415-51752-2,CURR CONTROV PHILOS,,,2015,,,,,,,121,137,,,,,17,Philosophy; Political Science,Philosophy; Government & Law,BD8HC,WOS:000363928600008,,,,,2021-08-07,

The benefits of such spaces are often tied to social justice, public health and recreation, biodiversity and-helping cities to deal with climate change. International policies and changes in public administration have encouraged user participation across multiple phases of green space development. Although sceptics towards participation are easily found supporting arguments sometimes stand without critique, not questioning how participation affects the physical quality of green spaces. This literature review surveyed empirical scientific studies seeking to answer the following research question: How does research to date reflect over user participation's contribution to public urban green space quality? The review includes 31 articles from peer-reviewed scientific journals and finds an array of arguments used to support and attribute potential benefits to participation. However, analysing what has been empirically tested in these articles shows an even and general lack of proof for these arguments, implying that many arguments for participation are taken for granted. A particularly large disparity was found between the discussing and testing of many arguments regarding how participation may directly benefit urban green spaces. Rather than assessing the physical outputs of participation, most of the empirical studies tested process benefits to users and administrators. Due to the discovered predominance of these process-driven studies, it remains unclear whether participation actually improves green spaces, or if it is just for the benefit of the people involved. The gap in scientific knowledge found here calls for a re-focus to case level research, empirically testing where the actual benefits of participation lie and how participation processes might best lead to high quality green spaces in practice.

The program's almost three decades of implementation saw positive impacts on the livelihood assets of local communities. CBFM has evolved to tackle global concerns as well, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, international climate change negotiations have drawn a means to provide financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD Plus). This mechanism hopes to bring triple benefits, namely: emission reduction, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. Given their parallel goals, CBFM sites are promising candidates for implementing REDD Plus, and the latter is expected to have important implications on the process and potential outcomes of CBFM. This paper looks into the local stakeholders' assessment of the impacts of CBFM on the livelihood assets of local communities and the potentials of REDD Plus implementation in the future. The literature is replete with examples emphasizing the importance of local stakeholder's participation in REDD Plus, yet their perception particularly on the added value it gives remained unclear. Results of the study revealed that CBFM implementation contributed largely to building the capital assets of people organization (PO) members, especially the human, social, natural and physical capitals. Full positive effects have yet to be realized though for the financial capital. PO members and the local institutions (DENR, LGU, NGO) expressed optimism, though with varied levels, on REDD Plus further enhancing the above capital assets. This optimism, however, does not translate to confidence in achieving the triple-benefits, as risks are also perceived by PO members posed by the likely creation of forest enclosures that could limit areas for livelihood activities. If realized, improved economic conditions could also encourage in-migration that would increase pressure to the forests. Caution should therefore be exercised in implementing REDD Plus to ensure that the intended goals are achieved in the context of views and aspirations of local stakeholders.","[Peras, Rose Jane J.; Pulhin, Juan M.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Inoue, Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138654, Japan","Peras, RJJ (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines.",,"Pulhin, Juan/AAV-6489-2021",,"University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","The first two authors would like to give special thanks to Prof. Makoto Inoue of The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan for funding support in implementing the research project entitled Institutional Options of Participatory Forest Management in a New Age implemented from August 2012-June 2013.

Despite the results of a landmark legal action against Shell, resolved in favour of the plaintiffs, those living in the Niger Delta continue to pay a heavy toll for decades of oil extraction, for which Shell still evades responsibility.

This article also focused on the related concepts like ecological carrying capacity, water resources carrying capacity, land carrying capacity as well as population carrying capacity. The concept of climate capacity was articulated against a background of global climate and environmental change. Essentially, China's efforts to adapt to climate change was a matter of improving climate capacity, which is the ecosystem as well as the frequency, the intensity and the scale of human's social activities that the climatic resources of a particular geographic area were supposed to support. The climate capacity has two components. One is the natural climate capacity, which includes temperature, sunlight, precipitation, extreme climatic events, etc. The other is the derived climate capacity, which includes water resources, land resources, ecological systems, climatic risks, etc. The climate capacity can be developed or be transferred between regions by taking engineering, technology or regime-based adaptive measures. However, these adaptive measures must be implemented under the principle of economic rationalism, ecological integrity, climate protection, and social justice. It is expected that by combining the climate capacity and its threshold value with the assessment of climate change risks, we are able to predict the optimal population carrying capacity and the scale of socioeconomic development, and furthermore, provide policy support for the socioeconomic development strategy and adaptive planning. In the regions with high climate capacity, there is a symbiotic relationship between adaptation and socioeconomic development. But, in the regions with limited climate capacity, irrational development may further damage the environment. Taking the Yangtze River delta, a region with high climate capacity, and a region of Ningxia, a region with limited climate capacity, as illustrative examples, the authors of this article analyzed the policy implications of climate capacity and further made suggestions on the problems of capacitylimited adaptation and development-driven adaptation. This article argued that the concept of climate capacity can not only be used as an analytical instrument of climate change economics, but also it can provide research support for planning regional adaptation and development with climate change impact and risk assessments.","[Pan, Jiahua; Zheng, Yan] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Urban & Environm Studies, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China; [Pan, Jiahua; Zheng, Yan] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianwu; Xie, Xinlu] Minist Land & Resources, Legal Ctr Land & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100034, Peoples R China","Zheng, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Urban & Environm Studies, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China.",zhengyan@cass.org.cn,,,,,,31,1,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1004-2857,2325-4262,,CHIN J POPUL RESOUR,Chin.

Yet the very groups who are most affected by climate change impacts are least likely to be involved in climate adaptation discussions. These communities face critical barriers to involvement including historical disenfranchisement, as well as a sense that climate change is distant and not personally relevant. Boundary organizations are increasingly playing an important role in bringing science to bear on policy decision-making with respect to climate change adaptation, an issue fraught with political and ideological tensions. Our project aimed to engage underrepresented communities in climate change adaptation decision-making using a neighborhood consensus conference model developed and tested in several diverse districts of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Our partnership, a linked chain'' of boundary organizations, devised a neighborhood consensus conference model to present best-available climate data as tangible, place-based scenarios. In so doing, we made climate change personal'' for those who remain outside of climate change planning discourses and opened an opportunity for them to assess their community's vulnerabilities and communicate their priorities for public investment. Our neighborhood-based model built trust and social capital with local residents and allowed us to bring new voices into conversations around climate change adaptation concerns and priorities. We believe this work will have a long term impact on local climate adaptation planning decisions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This article argues that the talk about bads produces common goods'. As such, the argument goes beyond what has been at the heart of the world risk society theory so far: it is not about the negative side effects of goods but the positive side effects of bads. They are producing normative horizons of common goods. This is what the author defines as emancipatory catastrophism'. Emancipatory catastrophism can be seen and analysed by using three conceptual lenses: first, the anticipation of global catastrophe violates sacred (unwritten) norms of human existence and civilization; second, thereby it causes an anthropological shock, and, third, a social catharsis. Resume La metamorphose du monde est induite par les effets emancipateurs et caches du risque mondial. Cet article soutient que le debat sur les maux produit des << biens communs >>. L'argument va au-dela de ce qui est au coeur de la theorie de la societe mondiale du risque ; il ne s'agit pas des effets secondaires negatifs des biens, mais des effets secondaires positifs des maux. Ils produisent des horizons normatifs pour les biens communs. C'est ce que j'appelle le << catastrophisme emancipateur >>. Le catastrophisme emancipateur peut etre vu et analyse en utilisant trois cadres conceptuels : premierement, l'anticipation d'une catastrophe mondiale transgresse les normes tacites de l'existence humaine ; deuxiemement, il engendre un choc anthropologique et troisiemement une catharsis sociale. Resumen La metamorfosis del mundo trata del oculto efecto secundario emancipatorio del riesgo global. Este trabajo sostiene que la charla sobre los males produce bienes comunes'.

Estan produciendo horizontes normativos de los bienes comunes. Esto es lo que defino como catastrofismo emancipador'. El catastrofismo emancipador puede ser visto y analizado por el uso de tres lentes conceptuales: en primer lugar, la anticipacion de la catastrofe global viola las normas sagradas (no escritas) de la existencia humana y la civilizacion; segundo, por lo tanto, se provoca un shock antropologico, y, en tercer lugar, una catarsis social.","Univ Munich, D-80801 Munich, Germany","Beck, U (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Konradstr 6, D-80801 Munich, Germany.",u.beck@lmu.de,,,,,,30,91,96,0,82,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0011-3921,1461-7064,,CURR SOCIOL,Curr.

Aiming to circumvent such disagreements, Climate Change Justice (2010) authors Eric Posner and David Weisbach argue against shaping treaty proposals according to requirements of either distributive or corrective justice. The USA's climate envoy, Todd Stern, takes a similar position. In this article I explain the practical and theoretical drawbacks of Posner & Weisbach's welfarist (utilitarian) perspective and propose an alternative. I show that their arguments fail to rule out John Rawls's non-utilitarian, political conception of international justice and human rights, the Law of Peoples. On this basis I develop a conception of climate justice that highlights implications of some of Rawls's principles and adds a principle for determining fair shares of climate-treaty-related benefits and burdens. I propose this conception as a moral framework for negotiating a treaty that would promote human welfare consistently with requirements of justice, and I argue that a treaty proposal satisfying these requirements could best satisfy Posner & Weisbach's own feasibility criteria.","[Bernstein, Alyssa R.] Ohio Univ, Philosophy Dept, Athens, OH 45701 USA","Bernstein, AR (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Ellis Hall 202, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",bernstei@ohio.edu,,,,,,57,4,4,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2155-0085,2155-0093,,ETHICS POLICY ENV,Ethics Policy Env.,,2015,18,2,,,SI,,123,146,,10.1080/21550085.2015.1070519,,,24,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,V79UN,WOS:000212140000002,,Green Published,,,2021-08-07,

This debate occurs in a context of increasing global inequality, global economic recession, conflict, and climate change. Discussions about the post-2015 education and development agenda in this context ambitiously seek to eradicate poverty, promote social and economic inclusion, tackle climate change, promote equity, and access to quality education. While the exact goals are not yet agreed and the shape of the final post-2015 development is still to be settled, there is a widespread consensus that education is priority and that equitable and quality education is core to the agenda. In this context, this paper discusses the continuities and discontinuities in the proposed post-2015 quality agenda through a textual analysis of UNESCO consultations on Education for All (EFA). In particular, this article focuses on the UNESCO post-2015 position paper and the Muscat Global Education meeting agreement in April 2015. They are significant policy texts as they evidence the current global education discourse on education and the development agenda and reflect the broad consultations and thinking reflected in the thematic consultations. They also are important as they seek to clarify and secure the focus on the Education for All goals within a future post-2015 development agenda. The analysis of these texts pays particular attention to how quality is conceptualised in these texts, how it is translated into targets and how teachers are located in the global education quality discourse. The paper argues that while potentially broad conceptualisations of quality emerge from these texts, quality is still being defined as literacy and numeracy and still being constrained by what can be measured. While teachers are identified as crucial to the quality agenda, there is still a failure to engage more broadly with teaching and learning as well as the diverse contexts of teaching and learning. The article argues that what is needed is a continued foregrounding of quality as a dynamic, process oriented social justice endeavour to give effect to a holistic and comprehensive approach to the broad quality agenda.

As the Fund begins to serve its function of transferring economic resources from developed to developing countries to support mitigation and adaptation activities, it faces several obstacles. Since contributions to the Fund by states or private parties are voluntary, they are not necessarily based on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's common but differentiated responsibilities principle. Its governing instrument also departs from UNFCCC principles. In addition, the Fund faces a significant ambition gap in pledges to fund its operations. By instantiating several informal means of applying climate justice norms to assessments of national contributions to climate finance, some of this resistance might be overcome, increasing support for the Fund and, with this, increasing prospects for reaching consensus on a new climate treaty architecture at COP 21.","[Vanderheiden, Steven] Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Vanderheiden, Steven] Charles Sturt Univ, CAPPE, Bathurst, NSW, Australia","Vanderheiden, S (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Steven.Vanderheiden@Colorado.edu,,,,,,15,4,4,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0393-2729,1751-9721,,INT SPECT,Int.

This paper explores a case study mapping social exclusion and vulnerability in Brisbane, Queensland, which found that while communities can be vulnerable through physical aspects of an area when social dimensions are added to the equation it amplifies or exacerbates the scale of vulnerability. The findings also suggest that in developing research agendas and policy debates around climate change, there could be benefits from interlinking the currently separate areas of work on social vulnerability to extreme weather events, to forms and processes of social inclusion/exclusion.","[Arthurson, Kathy] Flinders Univ S Australia, Med, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Baum, Scott] Griffith Univ, Griffith Hlth Inst & Urban Res Program, Populat & Social Hlth Res Program, Griffith, NSW, Australia","Arthurson, K (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Med, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",kathy.arthurson@flinders.edu.au,,"Arthurson, Kathy/0000-0003-2934-2250; Baum, Scott/0000-0003-1711-2087",,,,52,11,11,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,1,,,,,1,17,,10.1080/13549839.2013.818951,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V79VJ,WOS:000212142200001,,Green Published,,,2021-08-07,

To date, the majority of research focuses on measuring local climate efforts and evaluating the general efficacy of adopted climate action plans (CAPs). Cumulatively, these studies argue that socio-economic and demographic variables (such as the fiscal health of cities, city size, and median household income) are important factors in implementing climate policies. Less studied are issues of environmental justice and the impacts of climate change on population health. Through interviews with urban planners and a document analysis of CAPs, this study assesses how California cities with high levels of pollution and social vulnerability address climate change and public health. The findings of this study show that CAPs in these cities rarely analyse whether greenhouse gas reduction strategies will also yield health co-benefits, such as a reduction in the co-pollutants of climate change (i.e. ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides). In many instances, the net co-benefits of health are not monetised, quantified, or even identified by local governments. In California's most impacted cities, climate planning activities and work on public health are happening in a parallel manner rather than through an integrated approach. The results suggest a need for increased opportunities for interagency coordination and staff training to conduct health analyses, free and easily accessible tools, methods for prioritising funding streams, and the development of partnerships with community-based organisations for linking climate planning with public health.","[Mendez, Michael Anthony] Univ Calif Berkeley, Designated Emphasis Sci & Technol Studies, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Mendez, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Designated Emphasis Sci & Technol Studies, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",michaelmendez101@gmail.com,,,,,,92,6,6,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2015,20,6,,,SI,,637,663,,10.1080/13549839.2015.1038227,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,V79XZ,WOS:000212149000003,,,,,2021-08-07,

Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3 million to 5.6 million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

The rare coverage of climate justice issues often focuses on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) such as Kiribati and commonly makes use of four main media frames: SIDS as proof of climate change, SIDS as victims of climate change, SIDS communities as climate refugees, and SIDS as travel destinations. Yet these frames undermine the desire of SIDS communities to be seen as proactive, self-determining, and active agents of change. This paper explores the way in which Pacific Islanders view the existing media coverage of their concerns over climate change and how they would prefer the media to tell their stories.

Climatic risks to socio-ecosystems are unbounded and highly uncertain and as a result require learning-based approaches to generate appropriate adaptation responses. Geographical research can effectively integrate knowledge developed through the mutual learning of researchers and stakeholders within a place to help guide adaptation planning. The roles of the geographer as a social learning researcher are critically analysed within the context of climate change adaptation research undertaken to support regional natural resource management adaptation planning in South Australia. Three research roles from the social learning literature are used to frame the analysis: the organic intellectual; the advocate for social justice; and the contemporary professional academic. While the social learning helped to develop a range of experimental adaptation policies and actions, the research would have proceeded more effectively if the challenges of the approach had been initially understood. The problems which emerge from social learning research, including inevitable tensions between real-world and academic outcomes, need to be acknowledged along with any successes to prepare future geographers to facilitate learning about socio-ecological risk.","Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Bardsley, DK (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",douglas.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,85,5,6,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-9182,1465-3311,,AUST GEOGR,Aust.

I believe that among criminologists, this dedication to effect changes in social and legal justice disproportionately drives those of us historically kept out of the academy due to our race, gender, class, sexual identity, and/or other marginalizations. Fortunately, there is a growing diversity among criminologists and this has had a powerful impact on expanding the scope and depth of the field. At the same time, I am concerned that academic training and university climates frequently work against our commitment to advancing social and legal justice changes, what I refer to as criminology activism. This address is a call to action, stressing criminologists' responsibility to advocate for social and legal justice on small and large scales. Numerous types of criminology activism are identified (e.g., in research, service, and teaching), including the requisite to continue diversifying the representation of criminologists.","Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, Boulder, CO 80302 USA","Belknap, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, 327 UCB, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",joanne.belknap@colorado.edu,,,,,,115,34,35,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0011-1384,1745-9125,,CRIMINOLOGY,Criminololgy,FEB,2015,53,1,,,,,1,22,,10.1111/1745-9125.12063,,,22,Criminology & Penology,Criminology & Penology,CB9RG,WOS:000349969200001,,,,,2021-08-07,

We draw on fields such as science and technology studies, the philosophy of technology, and environmental ethics to highlight how dominant notions of apoliticism and ahistoricity are ingrained in contemporary engineering practice. We argue that a solely technological response to climate change does not question the social, political, and cultural tenet of infinite material growth, one of the root causes of climate change. In response to the contemporary engineering practice, we define an activist engineer as someone who not only can provide specific engineered solutions, but who also steps back from their work and tackles the question, What is the real problem and does this problem require an engineering intervention? Solving complex problems like climate change requires radical cultural change, and a significant obstacle is educating engineers about how to conceive of and create authentic alternatives, that is, solutions that differ from the paradigm of technologically improving our way out of problems. As a means to realize radically new solutions, we investigate how engineers might (re)deploy the concept of praxis, which raises awareness in engineers of the inherent politics of technological design. Praxis empowers engineers with a more comprehensive understanding of problems, and thus transforms technologies, when appropriate, into more socially just and ecologically sensitive interventions. Most importantly, praxis also raises a radical alternative rarely considered-not engineering a solution. Activist engineering offers a contrasting method to contemporary engineering practice and leads toward social justice and ecological protection through problem solving by asking not, How will we technologize our way out of the problems we face? but instead, What really needs to be done?.","[Karwat, Darshan M.

However, people may vote Green for very different reasons. The Green voter base is thus likely to be comprised of a number of distinct subpopulations. We employ Latent Profile Analysis to uncover subgroups within the Green voter base (n = 1,663) using data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study at Time Four (2012). We delineate subgroups based on variation in attitudes about the environment, equality, wealth, social justice, climate change, and biculturalism. Core Green Liberals (56% of Green voters) showed strong support across all ideological/value domains except wealth, while Green Dissonants (4%) valued the environment and believed in anthropogenic climate change, but were low across other domains. Ambivalent Biculturalists (20%) expressed strong support for biculturalism and weak support for social justice and equality. Greens in Principle (20%) supported equality and social justice, but were less supportive of biculturalism. Our study identifies points of convergence (such as environmental values) and crux values that represent points of divergence (such as valuing social justice and Maori rights) across distinct subpopulations of Green voters. These results highlight the diversity of the Green voter base and identify different crux points the Green Party must manage in order to maintain and grow their diverse voter base.","[Cowie, Lucy J.; Greaves, Lara M.; Sibley, Chris G.] Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Cowie, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Psychol, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",lcow342@aucklanduni.ac.nz,"Sibley, Chris G/D-2974-2009","Sibley, Chris G/0000-0002-4064-8800; Cowie, Lucy/0000-0001-7912-5591; Greaves, Lara/0000-0003-0537-7125",,,,48,5,5,0,6,NEW ZEALAND PSYCHOL SOC,WELLINGTON,"BUSINESS MANAGER PO BOX 4092, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND",0112-109X,1179-7924,,NEW ZEAL J PSYCHOL,N.

Very few proposals, however, have been as focused and developed as the just transition strategy proposed by global labour unions. Yet, labour unions are remarkably absent from discussions of the transition towards a green economy. This is surprising as labour unions are arguably the largest organizations in the world fighting for basic rights and more just social relations. This paper tries to advance the potential contribution of labour unions in this arena by asking: what is the full scope of just transition today and how have labour unions developed and refined it over the years to render the move towards a green economy both environmentally and socially sustainable? The concept of just transition is hotly debated within labour unions and has different interpretations, and hence different strategies. The last section assesses these interpretations by means of a normative framework, which seeks to fuse political economy and political ecology. Empirically, we add to the growing literature on labour environmentalism, as well as transitions more generally. Analytically, our goal is to place the various approaches to a just transition within a heuristic framework of environmental justice that is explicit about power relations when demanding justice, two themes central to this special issue.","[Stevis, Dimitris] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Felli, Romain] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Stevis, D (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",dimitris.stevis@colostate.edu; romain.felli@unige.ch,,,Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PBLAP1-134448],"The authors would like to thank the referees as well as the guest editors of the special issue for their helpful comments.

Through an analysis of the work of a loose civil society coalition in India mobilising around climate change justice, this paper argues that we need to be more attentive to the emerging geographies of climate justice, particularly in the global South where climate change provokes questions of uneven development processes as well as environmental concerns. The paper shows how climate justice has been scaled as an international justice issue through public discourses, national policies and civil society engagement in India. I argue that this focus on international climate justice narrows the political space for alternative articulations and claims for climate justice. Whereas climate justice has tended to focus on the nation-state as the key actor in addressing climate injustice I argue there are multiple entry points to address climate injustices at different scales. To understand what is meant by climate justice beyond the international sphere requires an exploration of the multiple manifestations and scales of climate justice and geographers could offer a critical contribution to an understanding of what national and local climate justice would mean in practice. These ideas are already starting to be operationalised in development programmes and climate finance, and a spatially grounded geographical understanding is crucial to future policy in this area.","IIED, Climate Change Grp, London WC1X 8NH, England","Fisher, S (corresponding author), IIED, Climate Change Grp, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1X 8NH, England.",susannah.fisher@iied.org,"Fisher, Susannah/AAH-4689-2019","Fisher, Susannah/0000-0002-5960-5704",,,,52,32,33,4,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

Existing trends suggest that there is likely to be greater food insecurity and fisheries conflicts due to issues such as: declining fishery resources; a North-South divide in investment; changing consumption patterns; increasing reliance on fishery resources for coastal communities; and inescapable poverty traps creating by low net resource productivity and few alternatives. Consequently, managing fisheries from a food security perspective will become increasingly necessary, and we therefore briefly review fisheries from the perspective of food security and evaluate it using a vulnerability framework. Specifically, we describe three key components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) for selected fisheries. This is followed by proposals to build the adaptive capacity of fisheries and recommendations to avoid future conflicts. Adaptive capacity attributes include assets, social flexibility and organization attributes, and learning. We present some key ways to build these aspects of the fishery to reduce the many potential environmental and social threats that increase the vulnerability of fisheries. Recommendations include fewer subsidies, reduced capital investment, precautionary management to minimize risks of ecosystem collapse, conservation of remaining resources, diversified portfolios of production and markets, and greater equity in contracts and distribution. Further, we recommend a contextual diagnostic and environmental justice framework to assess a range of options for fishery governance.","[McClanahan, Tim] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Allison, Edward H.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Cinner, Joshua E.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McClanahan, T (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA.",tmcclanahan@wcs.org,"Allison, Edward H/B-8615-2009; Cinner, Joshua/AAA-6823-2021; McClanahan, Tim/K-4998-2019","Cinner, Joshua/0000-0003-2675-9317; Allison, Edward/0000-0003-4663-1396; McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584",,,,111,111,112,8,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-2960,1467-2979,,FISH FISH,Fish.

This creates a challenge for climate justice advocates who seek to ensure that those least responsible for causing climate change do not bear unwanted burdens of mitigation. One way to promote climate justice could be to pay particular attention to the environmental policy preferences of citizens from poorer, lower-emitting countries. This paper examines opinions on environment-economy trade-offs and willingness to make personal financial contributions to protect the environment among residents of 42 developed and developing countries using data from the 2005-2008 World Values Survey, the 2010 Climate Risk Index, and World Bank development indicators. Results reveal that individuals in developing countries are less likely to support policies to prioritize environmental protection over economic growth but are more willing to donate personal income for pro-environmental efforts compared to citizens of more developed nations.

As a consequence, science has become a hegemonic way of knowing climate change by mainstream climate politics, which not only limits the actors and actions deemed legitimate in climate politics but also silences vulnerable communities and reinforces historical patterns of cultural and political marginalization. To combat this post-political condition, we seek to democratize climate knowledge and imagine the possibilities of climate praxis through an engagement with Gramscian political ecology and feminist science studies. This framework emphasizes how antihierarchical and experiential forms of knowledge can work to destabilize technocratic modes of governing. We illustrate the potential of our approach through ethnographic research with people in southern Appalachia whose knowledge of climate change is based in the perceptible effects of weather, landscape change due to exurbanization, and the potential impacts of new migrants they call climate refugees. Valuing this knowledge builds more diverse communities of action, resists the extraction of climate change from its complex society-nature entanglements, and reveals the intimate connections between climate justice and distinct cultural lifeways. We argue that only by opening up these new forms of climate praxis, which allow people to take action using the knowledge they already have, can more just socioecological transformations be brought into being.","[Rice, Jennifer L.; Heynen, Nik] Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Burke, Brian J.] Appalachian State Univ, Goodnight Family Sustainable Dev Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Rice, JL (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jlrice@uga.edu; burkebj@appstate.edu; nheynen@uga.edu,,,Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research Site (National Science Foundation) [DEB-0823293]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1440485] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0823293] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,This research is supported by funding from the Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research Site (National Science Foundation DEB-0823293).,,43,39,39,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Using ordinary least squares regression on a cross-sectional survey of 1003 individuals, flood impacts in three contiguous coastal neighbourhoods in Lagos, Nigeria, were modelled. The results show that approximately 52% of the variability in flood impact was accounted for by education, age, family structure, ethnicity, personal health concern and income. While involvement in coping was not a significant predictor of flood impacts, relocation emerged as a strong predictor. The inclusion of behavioural factors did not change the magnitude and significance of the relationship between demographic factors and flood impacts. However, the effects of age, education and personal health concern disappeared when environmental factors were controlled. The overall importance of the predictors for determining flood impact in decreasing order is as follows: income > coping strategies > ethnicity = participation in community development > family structure > personal health concerns > housing quality > reasons for living in residential locality > neighbourhood vulnerability to flood > housing vulnerability to flood.","[Ajibade, Idowu; Armah, Frederick Ato; Kuuire, Vincent Zubedaar; Luginaah, Isaac; McBean, Gordon] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Tenkorang, Eric Y.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Sociol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada","Ajibade, I (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",iajibade@uwo.ca,"Armah, Frederick Ato/R-3906-2017","Armah, Frederick Ato/0000-0002-9371-5683; Tenkorang, Eric/0000-0001-6127-3799; Luginaah, Isaac/0000-0001-7858-3048",,,,70,7,7,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Rather than managing forests according to interests in timber, conservation, land or livelihoods, REDD+ encourages forms of forest management that prioritise carbon. While international negotiations are shaping the rules of the programme, how it takes place on the ground will depend on its interpretation and implementation in different places. In this paper, we are interested in how the REDD+ Task Force (SatgasREDD+), an ad hoc body formed by presidential decree to design and implement REDD+ readiness activities in Indonesia, has attempted to mainstream the programme from 2010 to 2013. We develop a governmentality approach to focus on how the Task Force sought to introduce REDD+ carbon rationalities to forest politics. Based on extended ethnographic research, we identify three strategies: adopting and promoting the carbon discourses circulating among global REDD+ communities; making carbon visible and governable through mapping technologies; and implementing participatory technologies to encourage pro-REDD+ subjectivities. In some ways, the Task Force has been successful in building awareness about forest carbon among forest stakeholders in Indonesia. National civil society organisations, in particular, appear to be supportive of REDD+; however, they emphasise co-benefits' framed as Beyond Carbon', informed by social and environmental justice. For others, however, forests remain sources of timber and land, and new strategies are required if REDD+ is to have substantial impacts on forest governance in Indonesia. The Task Force's efforts reveal the difficult and contested processes through which global climate change programmes come to be embedded in national arenas.","[Astuti, Rini; McGregor, Andrew] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [McGregor, Andrew] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Astuti, R (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",rini.astuti@vuw.ac.nz; andrew.mcgregor@mq.edu.au,,"McGregor, Andrew/0000-0001-6476-346X; astuti, rini/0000-0001-5969-6223",Royal Society of New Zealand through the Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ),"The authors would like to acknowledge the generous funding of the Royal Society of New Zealand who supported this research through the Marsden Fund.

African climate change research reflects diverse mixtures of local priorities and international trends, often with some time lag. The research reviewed and represented in this special issue reveals clear gaps and weaknesses in relation to gendered understandings, approaches to environmental valuation, and climate and environmental justice. Implementational challenges range from resource constraints and perceived conflicts between meeting immediate development needs and longer term climate change action to lack of policy integration and effective governance. The potential importance of socio-ecological and technological transformations remains very largely unexplored and a sea change in attitudes and attention is required if the adaptation challenges are to be met.","[Simon, David] Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Simon, David] Chalmers Univ, Mistra Urban Futures, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Leck, Hayley] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2 2AE, England","Simon, D (corresponding author), Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",d.simon@rhul.ac.uk,,"Simon, David/0000-0002-3164-4138","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive SciNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1229429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish",,,66,20,20,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Less widely acknowledged is the intersectionality of these factors; that specific combinations of factors shape their own social position and thus affect experiences of power, oppression and vulnerability. To address emerging issues like climate change, it is vital to find a way to understand and approach multiple, intersecting axes of identity that shape how impacts will be distributed and experienced. This article introduces intersectionality, a concept for understanding multiple, co-constituting axes of difference and identity, and kyriarchy, a theory of power that describes the power structures intersectionality produces, and offers researchers a fresh way of approaching the interactions of power in planning research and practice.","[Osborne, Natalie] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia","Osborne, N (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Urban Res Program, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",n.osborne@griffith.edu.au,,"Osborne, Natalie/0000-0002-9430-822X",,,,110,29,29,0,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1473-0952,1741-3052,,PLAN THEOR,Plan.

In order to solve these problems, we have applied life cycle assessment and life cycle cost. But these methods cannot be a perfect decision-making tool because they can only evaluate environmental and economic burdens. Thus, as one of many practical methods the shared smart and mutual - green growth considers economic growth, environmental protection, social justice, science technology and art, and mutual voluntarism when applied to medical waste management in the Republic of Korea. Four systems were considered: incineration, incineration with heat recovery, steam sterilisation, and microwave disinfection. This research study aimed to assess pollutant emissions from treatment, transport, and disposal. Global warming potential, photochemical oxidant creation potential, acidifications potential, and human toxicity are considered to be environmental impacts. Total investment cost, transport cost, operation, and maintenance cost for the medical waste are considered in the economy evaluations though life cycle cost. The social development, science technology and art, and mutual voluntarism are analysed through the Delphi-method conducted by expert groups related to medical waste. The result is that incineration with heat recovery is the best solution. However, when heat recovery is impossible, incineration without heat recovery becomes the next best choice. That is why 95% of medical waste is currently treated by both incineration and incineration with heat recovery within the Republic of Korea.","[Koo, Ja-Kong; Jeong, Seung-Ik] Jungwon Univ, Dept Renewable Energy, Goesan, Chungbuk Provin, South Korea","Jeong, SI (corresponding author), Jungwon Univ, Dept Renewable Energy, Goesan, Chungbuk Provin, South Korea.",cole0914@naver.com,,,,,,22,5,5,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0734-242X,1096-3669,,WASTE MANAGE RES,Waste Manage.

The model is designed to employ low-cost secondary data, and it is rooted in a perspective that merges normative environmental justice concerns with theoretical grounding in health inequalities. Since the model employs International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) disease codes, it is transferable to other contexts, appropriate for use across spatial scales, and suitable for comparative analyses. We demonstrate the utility of the model through analysis of 2008-2010 hospitalization discharge data at state and county levels in Texas (USA). We identified several disease categories (i.e., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, heat-related, and respiratory) associated with climate change, and then selected corresponding ICD-9 codes with the highest hospitalization counts for further analyses. Selected diseases include ischemic heart disease, diarrhea, heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke/syncope, and asthma. Cardiovascular disease ranked first among the general categories of diseases for age-adjusted hospital admission rate (5286.37 per 100,000). In terms of specific selected diseases (per 100,000 population), asthma ranked first (517.51), followed by ischemic heart disease (195.20), diarrhea (75.35), and heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke/syncope (7.81). Charges associated with the selected diseases over the 3-year period amounted to US$5.6 billion. Blacks were disproportionately burdened by the selected diseases in comparison to non-Hispanic whites, while Hispanics were not. Spatial distributions of the selected disease rates revealed geographic zones of disproportionate risk. Based upon a down-scaled regional climate-change projection model, we estimate a >5% increase in the incidence and treatment costs of asthma attributable to climate change between the baseline and 2040-2050 in Texas. Additionally, the inequalities described here will be accentuated, with blacks facing amplified health disparities in the future. These predicted trends raise both intergenerational and distributional climate health justice concerns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental consequences include increased temperature, excess precipitation in some areas and droughts in others, extreme weather events, and increased sea level. These consequences adversely affect agricultural production, access to safe water, and worker productivity, and, by inundating land or making land uninhabitable and uncultivatable, will force many people to become environmental refugees. Adverse health effects caused by climate change include heat-related disorders, vector-borne diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, respiratory and allergic disorders, malnutrition, collective violence, and mental health problems. These environmental and health consequences threaten civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, including rights to life, access to safe food and water, health, security, shelter, and culture. On a national or local level, those people who are most vulnerable to the adverse environmental and health consequences of climate change include poor people, members of minority groups, women, children, older people, people with chronic diseases and disabilities, those residing in areas with a high prevalence of climate-related diseases, and workers exposed to extreme heat or increased weather variability. On a global level, there is much inequity, with low-income countries, which produce the least greenhouse gases (GHGs), being more adversely affected by climate change than high-income countries, which produce substantially higher amounts of GHGs yet are less immediately affected. In addition, low-income countries have far less capability to adapt to climate change than high-income countries. Adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change needed to protect human society must also be planned to protect human rights, promote social justice, and avoid creating new problems or exacerbating existing problems for vulnerable populations.","[Levy, Barry S.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sherborn, MA 01770 USA; [Patz, Jonathan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Global Hlth Inst, Nelson Inst, Madison, WI USA; [Patz, Jonathan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA","Levy, BS (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sherborn, MA 01770 USA.",blevy@igc.org,,,,,,122,91,92,8,114,UBIQUITY PRESS LTD,LONDON,"2N, 6 OSBORNE ST, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND",2214-9996,,,ANN GLOB HEALTH,Ann.

In response, scholars have increasingly identified barriers to adaptation in the literature. But, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. To further improve understanding of barriers to adaptation and identify gaps in the state-of-the-art knowledge, we undertook a synthesis of empirical literature from sub-Saharan Africa focusing on vulnerable, natural resource-dependent communities and livelihoods. Our review illustrates that: (1) local-level studies that reveal barriers to adaptation are diverse, although there is a propensity for studies on small-holder farmers; (2) many of the studies identify several barriers to adaptation, but appreciation of their interactions and compounded impacts remains scarce; and (3) most of the barriers uncovered relate broadly to biophysical, knowledge, and financial constraints on agricultural production and rural development. More hidden and under-acknowledged political, social, and psychological barriers are rarely mentioned, unless captured in studies that specifically set out to investigate these. We finish our review by highlighting gaps in understanding and by suggesting future research directions, focusing on issues of social justice. We argue that research on barriers needs to start asking why these barriers emerge, how they work together to shape adaptation processes, who they affect most, and what is needed to overcome them.

This is most acute in cities, where the majority of people now live and the need to create new pathways of co-existence between humans and other species has been recognized. The convergence of rapid urbanization and anthropogenic climate change has had disproportionately negative effects on the urban poor and those most marginalised (human and non-human). This paper provides a critical overview of the emergent field of urban climate justice which focuses on the complex links between environmental sustainability, human vulnerability and biodiversity loss in the natural environment. This is an interdisciplinary agenda demanding new forms of sustainability research and practical engagement underpinned by calls for a more integrated approach to eco-social justice principles around human and other species equity in cities.","[Steele, Wendy; Mata, Luis; Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Mata, Luis] RMIT Univ, Interdisciplinary Conservat Sci Res Grp, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Steele, W (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",wendy.steele@rmit.edu.au,"Funfgeld, Hartmut/X-8504-2019; Funfgeld, Hartmut/C-5962-2011","Funfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Funfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207; Steele, Wendy/0000-0003-1565-3752; Mata, Luis/0000-0002-4142-8666",Australian Research Council on DECRA projectAustralian Research Council [DE120102428]; Australian Government's national Environmental Research Program (NERP)Australian Government; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED)Australian Research Council,W.S. wishes to acknowledge funding from the Australian Research Council on DECRA project [DE120102428].

The argument is based on a comprehensive array of values elicited from Canadians in several cities. To begin, we define the urban forest as inclusive of all the trees in the city and thus representing the predominant contributor to a city's green infrastructure. Then we enumerate and explain the broad diversity of ways in which urban people value trees in the city. We, thus, show the myriad pathways by which trees contribute positively to any city's social, economic, and ecological sustainability. Following a short summary of the ways in which trees may detract from people's quality of life, we present promising management directions for urban-forest improvement, as we understand the situation in Canada. We conclude that all cities can enhance their sustainability by improving the urban forest.","[Duinker, Peter N.; Ordonez, Camilo; Toni, Sydney A.; Nitoslawski, Sophie A.] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Steenberg, James W.

As the currency of distribution, this account proposes a hybrid of capabilities and ecological space. Although the goal of distributive justice should be to secure and promote people's capabilities now and in the future, doing so requires acknowledging that these capabilities are dependent on the biophysical preconditions as well as inculcating the ethos of restraint. Both issues have been highlighted from the perspective of the ecological space paradigm. Concerning the scope of distributive justice, the integration can combine the advantages of the ecological space paradigm regarding the allocation of the responsibilities involved in environmental sustainability with the strength of the capabilities approach regarding people's entitlements. The pattern of distribution starts from a capability threshold. In order to achieve this threshold, ecological space should be provided sufficiently, and the remaining ecological space budget could then be distributed according to the equal per capita principle.","[Peeters, Wouter; Dirix, Jo; Sterckx, Sigrid] Free Univ Brussels VUB, Ctr Eth & Humanism, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Sterckx, Sigrid] Univ Ghent, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, Bioeth Inst Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Peeters, W (corresponding author), Free Univ Brussels VUB, Ctr Eth & Humanism, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, Room 5C444,Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",wouter.peeters@vub.ac.be; jdirix@vub.ac.be; Sigrid.sterckx@ugent.be,"Peeters, Wouter/AAL-3254-2021","Peeters, Wouter/0000-0002-6427-9085",,,,80,6,6,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1187-7863,1573-322X,,J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC,J.

It has not yet, however, given adequate theoretical consideration to the requirements of environmental sustainability. Sen has focussed on the instrumental importance of human development for achieving sustainability, but has failed to consider the limits of this account, especially with respect to consumption-reduction. Nussbaum has criticised constraining material consumption for its paternalistic prescription of one particular conception of the good life, without considering it as an imperative of justice. We discuss two possible extensions of the capabilities approach. First, the concept of capability ceilings contains several attractive elements, but it also suffers from some shortcomings. Therefore, second, we advocate constraining people's combinations of functionings in accordance with a personal budget which consists of a fair share of environmental resources.","[Peeters, Wouter; Dirix, Jo] Free Univ Brussels VUB, Ctr Eth & Humanism, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Sterckx, Sigrid] Univ Ghent, Bioeth Inst Ghent, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Peeters, W (corresponding author), Free Univ Brussels VUB, Ctr Eth & Humanism, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",wouter.peeters@vub.ac.be; jo.dirix@vub.ac.be; sigrid.sterckx@ugent.be,"Peeters, Wouter/AAL-3254-2021","Peeters, Wouter/0000-0002-6427-9085",,,,62,11,11,0,17,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Management of the associated health risks and changing health service requirements requires adequate responses at local levels. Health-care providers are central to these responses. While climate change raises ethical questions about its causes, impacts and social justice, medicine and bioethics typically focus on individual patients and research participants rather than these broader issues. We broaden this focus by examining awareness among health-care providers in the Caribbean region, where geographic and socioeconomic features pose particular vulnerabilities to climate change. In focus groups, Caribbean providers described rises in mosquito-borne, flood-related, heat-related, respiratory and mental illnesses, and attributed these to local impacts of climate change. Their discussions showed that the significance of these impacts differs in different Caribbean nations, raising policy and social justice questions. Bioethics and public health ethics are situated to frame, inform and initiate public and policy dialog about values and scientific evidence associated with climate change. We urge readers to initiate such dialog within their own institutions about the context-dependent nature of the burdens of climate change, and values and policies that permit it to worsen.","[Macpherson, Cheryl C.] St Georges Univ, Sch Med, St Georges, Grenada; [Macpherson, Cheryl C.; Akpinar-Elci, Muge] Windward Isl Res & Educ Fdn WINDREF, True Blue, Grenada; [Akpinar-Elci, Muge] Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Global Hlth, Hlth Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Macpherson, CC (corresponding author), St Georges Univ, Sch Med, Dept Bioeth, POB 7, St Georges, Grenada.",ccox@sgu.edu,"Macpherson, Cheryl C/AAL-2058-2021","Macpherson, Cheryl C/0000-0002-2368-2089",Wellcome Trust Society and Ethics ProgramWellcome Trust [101782/Z/13/Z],The Wellcome Trust Society and Ethics Program (Reference number 101782/Z/13/Z).,,38,12,12,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1754-9973,1754-9981,,PUBLIC HEALTH ETH-UK,Public Health Ethics,JUL,2015,8,2,,,,,196,208,,10.1093/phe/phv008,,,13,"Ethics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics","Social Sciences - Other Topics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics",CM9HI,WOS:000358018300010,26180551,"Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

In practice, however, when new energy projects are proposed in specific places and regions, their proponents often face public resistance. This paper is a synthesis of a multi-investigator study of community responses to new energy developments in four Canadian provinces. We identify three questions that communities are asking about the governance of these projects: (1) Are the decision-making and regulatory processes open, rigorous, and accountable? (2) Have local people been meaningfully engaged? (3) Are the costs and benefits fairly distributed? Overall, we argue that public resistance is often a legitimate response stemming from inadequate governance of energy development. Specifically, and partly because of the changing role of government in policy-making and regulation, local communities lose trust that governance reflects and will protect their social and ecological values. We conclude that innovation in community engagement is needed, particularly in the context of rapid institutional change and governments that might be unable or unwilling to oversee inclusive decision-making processes.

To what extent are people in LDCs ready to make sacrifices to improve environmental conditions?

Moreover, they are more likely to think that wealthier countries should make more effort to protect the environment, and are less willing to make personal economic sacrifices or change their consumption behavior to accommodate environmental concerns.

Their effects on the lives of vulnerable human populations and ecosystems across the world are widely known to be devastating. Yet a legal order that denies the victims of such ecological persecution safe haven, no matter how great its use of force (e.g., detention, arrest, forced return) cannot, by definition, be violent. The power of law, used to protect states' rights to exclude from their jurisdictions growing numbers displaced involuntarily by global climate harms, in being a source of legitimate right', is never the same as violence. This article challenges the ongoing validity of this assumption. It points to some of the ways in which legal instruments are used today to deny those displaced by climatic conditions sufficient normative status to guarantee their safety. What is needed instead is a new critical normative understanding of the evolving relationship between climate change, violence, justice, and law, one that re-assesses the democratic justificatory grounds for the current positions of non-responsibility for the climate displaced whilst re-affirming such people's legal and political status as equal co-members of the politically constituted international community of humanity.","[Skillington, Tracey] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Cork, Ireland","Skillington, T (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Dept Sociol, Cork, Ireland.",t.skillington@ucc.ie,,,,,,70,6,6,1,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4310,1461-7137,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

Moral Foundations, Moral Reasoning, and Political Disagreement",NEUROETHICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Moral cognition; Moral foundations; Political disagreement,EMOTIONAL DOG; CONSERVATIVES; CULTURE,"Can't we all disagree more constructively? Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in political partisanship: the 2013 shutdown of the US government as well as an ever more divided political landscape in Europe illustrate that citizens and representatives of developed nations fundamentally disagree over virtually every significant issue of public policy, from immigration to health care, from the regulation of financial markets to climate change, from drug policies to medical procedures (Koleva et al. Journal of Research in Personality 46:184-194, 2012). The emerging field of political psychology brings the tools of moral psychology to bear on this issue. It suggests that the main conflict shaping politics today can be explained in terms of people's moral foundations (Graham et al. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 96(5):1029-1046, 2009; Haidt 2012; Graham et al. PLOS One 7(12):1-13, (2012); cf. also Rai and Fiske Psychological Review 118:57-75, 2011): progressive liberals, it is argued, view society as consisting of separate individuals with differing values and life plans, whereas conservatives rely on a thicker notion of political morality that includes traditions, communities, and values of purity (Haidt and Graham Social Justice Research 20:98-116, 2007). In this paper, I explore the normative implications of this theory. In particular, I will argue that its proponents take it to support an asymmetry of understanding: if deep political disagreements reflect differences in people's moral foundations, and these disagreements cannot be rationally resolved, then overcoming them makes it necessary to acknowledge the moral foundations of the other side's political outlook. But conservatives, the theory suggests, already do acknowledge all of the liberal moral foundations, and not vice versa. To overcome partisanship and the resulting political deadlock, then, it seems to be up to liberals to move closer towards the conservative side, and not vice versa.

In the end, I shall argue that the available evidence does support an asymmetry, but that it is the opposite of what Moral Foundations theorists think it is.

It introduces and develops the concept of speaking like an indigenous state to examine the Bolivian state's recent use of a pair of indigenous linguistic concepts, Living Well and Earth Mother, representing the identities of citizens and their rights to resources and livelihoods. State relations to indigenous social movements highlight the use of Living Well and Earth Mother concepts through accommodation, resistance, and protaganism. Six active issues of environmental governance are examined: (1) climate change and justice movement; (2) agrarian reform, agrobiodiversity, and food justice; (3) water resources; (4) indigenous territories; (5) Protected Areas; and (6) extractive industries (mining, hydrocarbons). The usages of Living Well and Earth Mother show versatility as they have been mobilized in the respatializing of the politics and social-power dynamics of environmental issues at scales of the state, global and international institutions, and community and local levels. Analysis also reveals deployment of Living Well and Earth Mother that is discursively influential and yet conceptually reduced and unevenly applied, thus suggesting a characteristic of verisimilitude. My analysis determines that respatialization at various levels, including territorial transitions of sub-national regional spaces, are associated with the heightened articulation of environmental governance through indigeneity and speaking like an indigenous state amid resource nationalism. Linkages and logics operating within this conjuncture differ from the prevailing interpretation of the Bolivian state's use of Living Well and Earth Mother as solely an unwitting contradiction or instrumentalist camouflage.

The overwhelming majority of approaches in environmental ethics have focused on either distributive justice or rights-based frameworks. Climate change justice, however, can be explored through an alternative framework, an approach based on the recognition theory of Axel Honneth that has not been systematically engaged with in this field. A critique of John Rawls' The Law of Peoples as an exemplar of distributive approaches reveals a number of limitations inherent in Rawlsian models of climate-change justice. Honneth's theory of recognition is an advance on distributive models toward a notion of climate justice in which the conditions necessary for the functioning and flourishment of human freedom includes climatic stability as a basic social condition. The ideal of mutual recognition provides a basis for environmental protections, including but not limited to the global atmosphere as a necessary condition for the realization of self-autonomy for all human kind.","[Brincat, Shannon] Griffith Univ, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia","Brincat, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.brincat@griffith.edu.au,,"Brincat, Shannon/0000-0002-1426-5793",,,,78,3,3,4,26,ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY INC,DENTON,"UNIV NORTH TEXAS, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, PO BOX 13496, DENTON, TX 76203-3496 USA",0163-4275,2153-7895,,ENVIRON ETHICS,Environ.

In this paper we synthesize research on food security in this region; important precursors and early work include reports on the impacts of land claims, the cumulative effects of industrial development and environmental change, and the health impacts of the nutrition transition among Indigenous peoples. Building on these foundations, food security research in the North has followed a path similar to that taken in the global food security literature, beginning with nutritional adequacy and security of food supplies and then downscaling to a focus on issues at the livelihood and household level. Our meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature reveals many reasons why people are food-insecure: challenges such as remoteness, climate change, and the high costs of food and fuel all play important roles. However, the primary drivers of food insecurity that we identify in this review relate to governance and policy challenges that have been recognized and critiqued for decades. Recommendations for future research include an improved focus on participatory research and food security interventions that acknowledge and focus on supporting the rights of local peoples to pursue food security on their own terms. This paper is relevant in the context of climatic and environmental change because it captures the role of shifting political ecologies as increased geopolitical interests in the North appear to be obscuring the rights and needs of local peoples to access and control their own land and resources.","[Loring, Philip A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada; [Gerlach, S.

Indeed, some peoples and communities already bearing the brunt of climate change are resorting to self-help measures including litigation. I argue that the doctrine of universal civil jurisdiction could be the new dynamic in the quest for international climate justice.

Using components of the ecological footprint, we construct a measure of each nation's relative contributions to carbon dioxide emissions after accounting for the amount sequestered by domestic forestlands. We refer to this measure as the climate footprint, and construct a structural equation model to test key theorizations in the environmental sociology literature. We add to this body of work by incorporating and empirically testing ecofeminist positions that the status of women is a cause and an effect of environmental conditions. Results suggest women and the environment are interconnected dimensions of exploitation, as ecological losses weaken women's status in nations. We also find that nations with greater female representation in governing bodies have lower climate footprints, controlling for domestic (urbanization, production) and global (world-system integration) drivers. Conclusions point to the potential for gender equality and improving the status of women worldwide to curtail climate change. Other theoretical and empirical implications are treated, including the benefits of bringing women into theories of the environment and the utility of structural equation techniques for testing hypotheses that specify direct and indirect connections among relevant predictors and the outcome.","[McKinney, Laura A.] Tulane Univ, Dept Sociol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Fulkerson, Gregory M.] SUNY Coll Oneonta, Dept Sociol, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA","McKinney, LA (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Sociol, 220 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",lauramc@tulane.edu; fulkergm@oneonta.edu,,,,,,81,19,19,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-7466,1573-6725,,SOC JUSTICE RES,Soc.

This assertion is based on findings arising from a major research project examining public values, attitudes and acceptability with regards to whole energy system change using a mixed-method (six deliberative workshops, n=68, and a nationally representative survey, n = 2441), interdisciplinary approach. Through the research we identify a set of social values associated with desirable energy futures in the UK, where the values represent identifiable cultural resources people draw on to guide their preference formation about particular aspects of energy system change. As such, we characterise public perspectives as being underpinned by six value clusters relating to efficiency and wastefulness, environment and nature, security and stability, social justice and fairness, autonomy and power, and processes and change. We argue that this 'value system' provides a basis for understanding core reasons for public acceptance or rejection of different energy system aspects and processes. We conclude that a focus on values that underpin more specific preferences for energy system change brings insights that could provide a basis for improved dialogue, more robust decision-making, and for anticipating likely points of conflict in energy transitions.

We sought to understand the state of knowledge on relationships between health equity-i.e. health inequalities that are socially produced-and food systems, where the concepts of 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' are prominent. We undertook exploratory scopingandmappingstages of a 'meta-narrative synthesis' on pathways from global food systems to health equity outcomes. The review was oriented by a conceptual framework delineating eight pathways to health (in) equity through the food system: 1-Multi-Scalar Environmental, Social Context; 2-Occupational Exposures; 3-Environmental Change; 4-Traditional Livelihoods, Cultural Continuity; 5-Intake of Contaminants; 6-Nutrition; 7-Social Determinants of Health and 8-Political, Economic and Regulatory context. The terms 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' were, respectively, paired with a series of health equity-related terms. Combinations of health equity and food security (1414 citations) greatly outnumbered pairings with food sovereignty (18 citations). Prominent crosscutting themes that were observed included climate change, biotechnology, gender, racialization, indigeneity, poverty, citizenship and HIV as well as institutional barriers to reducing health inequities in the food system. The literature indicates that food sovereignty-based approaches to health in specific contexts, such as advancing healthy school food systems, promoting soil fertility, gender equity and nutrition, and addressing structural racism, can complement the longer-term socio-political restructuring processes that health equity requires. Our conceptual model offers a useful starting point for identifying interventions with strong potential to promote health equity. A research agenda to explore project-based interventions in the food system along these pathways can support the identification of ways to strengthen both food sovereignty and health equity.","[Weiler, Anelyse M.] Univ Toronto, Sociol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hergesheimer, Chris; Wittman, Hannah] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Brisbois, Ben; Yassi, Annalee; Spiegel, Jerry M.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Global Hlth Res Program, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Spiegel, JM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Global Hlth Res Program, 430-2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",jerry.spiegel@ubc.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [ROH-115207],"The authors are funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Our purpose here is to conduct a broad overview of the place of gender in environmental sociology. We review gender-relevant scholarship within environmental sociology and argue that to date, critical gender theorizing in the sub-discipline is relatively undeveloped, as evidenced by theory that examines gender without considering power relations. We argue that this represents a shortcoming that should be addressed by future scholarship. In order to inform future critical gender-environment theorizing, we provide a brief review of ecofeminism and note promising examples of scholarship that takes power and inequality seriously when accounting for phenomena of relevance to women and the environment. It is likely that theorizing at the intersection of gender and the environment will become more prevalent given a growing consensus that social justice and equity are precursors to ecological sustainability; environmental sociologists could be the vanguard of critical gender-environment theory.","[Kennedy, Emily Huddart] Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Environm Sociol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Kennedy, Emily Huddart; Dzialo, Liz] Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Kennedy, EH (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Wilson Short Hall 213, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",emily.kennedy@wsu.edu,,"Huddart Kennedy, Emily/0000-0002-6723-4210",,,,42,14,14,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-9020,,,SOCIOL COMPASS,Sociol.

University of Michigan students and faculty collaborated with Environmental Justice Organizations, Liabilities and Trade (EJOLT), a European Union mapping initiative, to identify US cases for their wider study. We began with an intensive scholarly and media literature review, combined with results from 31 semi-structured interviews with informants from a broad database of US environmental justice (EJ) departments, initiatives, and symposia. We then wrote short descriptions of 90 EJ conflict cases in US history, incorporating them into a detailed participatory online survey to garner expert and public input on which of them have been the most influential in shaping US popular opinion, policy, and political will on EJ issues. Seeking to provide a rigorous basis for the EJOLT mapping exercise, but also to instill an ethic of knowledge co-creation within the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s mechanisms for assessing EJ issues, we distributed the survey widely and posted it on the EPA's EJ Blog. It received over 1000 hits in the first two weeks. Our surveys remained active for about three weeks, for a total of 350 responses (101 from respondents who self-identified as EJ experts, and 249 from those identifying as members of the wider public). After eliminating incomplete or duplicate responses, we weighted to correct for that imbalance in the numbers, considering a total of 165 in our analysis. These responses comprise the list of 40 cases (unranked) we launched on the atlas in March 2014, and describe in this paper; the top five including multiple oil- or petroleum-based cases, one clean water case, one climate change case, and one confined animal feeding operation case.","[Grafton, Bernadette; Perez, Alejandro Colsa; Hintzen, Katy; Mohai, Paul; Orvis, Sara; Hardin, Rebecca] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Hardin, R (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rdhardin@umich.edu,,,,,,31,4,4,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2156-5503,2156-5511,,POLIT GROUPS IDENTIT,Polit.

International Natural Debt (IND) is a measure of accountability for climate change that straightforwardly and transparently attributes radiative forcing from extant emissions of the two most significant climate active pollutants (CAPs) - carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane-to individual entities such as countries or sectors. Here, we demonstrate how the IND metric readily operationalizes climate debt for a diversity of purposes. We characterize the vast range spanned by the global distribution of IND in total and per capita terms. Then, in a manner akin to carbon intensity, we consider the efficiency with which countries have accumulated IND in their pursuit of expanding economic output and diminishing ill-health, revealing priorities and pathways for countries to more effectively convert their future climate debt into income and/or health gains. Next, we forecast the IND consequences from countries achieving the ambitious goal of decreasing their CAP emissions to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050, exposing how the composition of IND, determined by the magnitude and timing of historical emissions, constrains each country's capacity to reduce its climate debt. Lastly, we assess the IND implications from a hypothesized rapid displacement of coal by natural gas for power generation in the United States, identifying the combination of conditions under which such a substitution tilts positive or negative in terms of IND. These applications of IND reveal how the metric can both assess climate debt in comparison to other key metrics and investigate mitigation goals and strategies through scenario exercises. Ultimately, we seek to open an intellectual terrain for climate debt analyses and invite more participatory and inclusive discussions about the consequent political and economic implications of such a multiple CAP and accountability-based perspective.

In this context, this paper, using the case study of 'Charanaka Solar Park' in Gujarat state, qualitatively analyses the degree of provision for procedural justice in solar energy implementation in India using a framework drawn from social environmental and energy justice literatures. The case study illustrates how the failure of various aspects of procedural justice can result in unnecessarily large impacts on the livelihoods of rural communities and the further marginalisation of those of lowest status. We conclude with discussion of the aspects of procedural justice that need attention in low carbon energy developments in developing countries alongside some policy and governance suggestions for the achievement of this in India and elsewhere.

Prior studies have found increased heat exposure for individuals of lower socioeconomic status in several US cities, but few comparative analyses of the social distribution of urban heat have been conducted. To address this gap, our paper examines and compares the environmental justice consequences of urban heat risk in the three largest US cities: New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Risk to urban heat is estimated on the basis of three characteristics of the urban thermal landscape: land surface temperature, vegetation abundance, and structural density of the built urban environment. These variables are combined to develop an urban heat risk index, which is then statistically compared with social vulnerability indicators representing socioeconomic status, age, disability, race/ethnicity, and linguistic isolation. The results indicate a consistent and significant statistical association between lower socioeconomic and minority status and greater urban heat risk, in all three cities. Our findings support a growing body of environmental justice literature that indicates the presence of a landscape of thermal inequity in US cities and underscores the need to conduct comparative analyses of social inequities in exposure to urban heat.","[Mitchell, Bruce C.] Univ S Florida, Sch Geosci, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Chakraborty, Jayajit] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Mitchell, BC (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Sch Geosci, 4201 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",bcmitche@mail.usf.edu; jchakraborty@utep.edu,"Mitchell, Bruce Coffyn/J-4199-2013","Mitchell, Bruce Coffyn/0000-0002-8184-2757",,,,43,22,22,4,60,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

As a first step to assess the transformational potential of such organisations, this paper examines the ways in which they frame their activities. This reveals an important challenge they face: in addressing the broader public, do they promote transformative' behaviours or do they limit themselves to encouraging 'easy changes' to maintain their appeal? We find evidence that many organisations within this movement avoid 'transformative' frames. The main reasons for this are organisers' perceptions that transformational frames lack resonance with broader audiences, as well as wider cultural contexts that caution against behavioural intervention. The analysis draws on interviews with key actors in the low carbon lifestyle movement and combines insights from the literatures on collective action framing and lifestyle movements.

Or is it the capitalist system, itself, that has been at the root of the environmental and social crises we now face? This letter engages with this ongoing debate by drawing on material from a wider study, 'Achieving Environmental Justice', which examined the extent, form and causes of environmental justice and injustice in a range of countries with varying depths of marketization-United States, South Korea, United Kingdom, Sweden, China, Bolivia and Cuba. The analysis described here focuses on the interview material from this mixed methods study, drawing on over 140 interviews with officials, policy makers, and civil society leaders. The letter argues that there is an apparent propensity for capitalist processes to exacerbate, rather than reduce, environmental problems and inequities though the pursuit of relentless economic growth and profit accumulation. Therefore, we should perhaps let go of efforts to resolve environmental injustice within the constraints of capitalism and, instead, build an alternative economic system that can meet human needs in the context of a harmonious and respectful relationship with nature.","[Bell, Karen] Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England","Bell, K (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",karen.bell@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,36,14,14,0,35,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Heat waves have become progressively more severe due to increasing relative humidity and nighttime temperatures, which increases the health risks of exposed communities, especially Latino farmworkers and other socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Using a superensemble of simulations with the Hadley Centre Regional Model (HadRM3P), we find that (1) simulations of the hottest summer days during the 2000s were twice as likely to occur using observed levels of greenhouse gases than in a counterfactual world without major human activities, suggesting a strong relationship between heat extremes and the increase in human emissions of greenhouse gases, (2) detrimental impacts of heat on public health-relevant variables, such as the number of days above 40 A degrees C, can be quantified and attributed to human activities using PEA, and (3) PEA can serve as a tool for addressing climate justice concerns of populations within developed nations who are disproportionately exposed to climate risks.","[Mera, Roberto; Rupp, David E.; Mote, Philip] Oregon State Univ, Oregon Climate Change Res Inst, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Mera, Roberto] Union Concerned Scientists, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Massey, Neil; Allen, Myles] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Allen, Myles] Univ Oxford, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Frumhoff, Peter C.] Union Concerned Scientists, Cambridge, MA 02238 USA","Mera, R (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Oregon Climate Change Res Inst, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",rmera@ucsusa.org,"Rupp, David/G-8171-2014; Mote, Philip/AAB-3500-2021","Massey, Neil/0000-0003-1211-1341",Postdocs Applying Climate Expertise (PACE) Fellowship Program; NOAA Climate Program OfficeNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"This research was supported by the Postdocs Applying Climate Expertise (PACE) Fellowship Program, partially funded by the NOAA Climate Program Office and administered by the UCAR Visiting Scientist Programs, Energy Foundation, Fresh Sound Foundation, The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, Kendall Fellows Science Program (Union of Concerned Scientists), Mertz Gilmore Foundation, V.

While it was long perceived as impossible to directly link a singular event with external climate drivers the emerging science of probabilistic event attribution renders it possible to attribute the fraction of risk caused by anthropogenic climate change to particular weather events and their associated losses. The robust link of only a small fraction of excessive deaths in, e.g., a heatwave to manmade climate change is very significant from an ethical point of view and we argue that this has widespread implications, e.g. for pending policy decisions concerning the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and the recognition of such losses in the broader context of climate justice.","[Thompson, Allen] Oregon State Univ, Sch Hist Philosophy & Religion, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Otto, Friederike E.

The citizens of these states will not only lose their physical homeland but also their social structure and cultural community. The focus here is on cultural loss. While its subjective importance is easy to grasp, it is harder to see cultural loss as a matter of justice. This paper first presents an account of why cultural loss is often seen as merely unfortunate but not unjust. Against these worries, the paper argues that we have a right that no one threatens our social bases of self-respect and that societal cultures are one important base of self-respect. The discussion concludes that anthropogenic climate change affects peoples' rights with regard to the cultural dimension and that therefore adaptation efforts ought to protect the social bases of self-respect of those climate refugees whose physical, political, and cultural existence is threatened by our inability to keep emissions below safe levels.","[Zellentin, Alexa] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland","Zellentin, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, G303 Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland.",alexa.zellentin@gmail.com,"Zellentin, Alexa/AAL-6084-2021","Zellentin, Alexa/0000-0002-3109-3524",,,,20,13,13,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Such understandings have been shown to vary, however. Based on German, Indian and US media coverage, we develop a typology of different constructions of climate justice. The five patterns we identify differ considerably across several dimensions, including the valuation of certain goods and rights, the definition of moral in-groups, and the basic principles for climate governance. These patterns can be found in all three countries, but their importance varies between them. The US debate is especially conflictive, with some actors emphasizing freedom from state intervention and others demanding provident political action. Although the positions in Germany and India are less divergent, there is also no agreement on how to address climate change in a just way in these countries. In particular, the conflict between global and intergenerational justice demands - reflecting the nature of climate change - and the enduring relevance of traditional conceptions focusing on contemporary and national communities are intricate.","[Schmidt, Andreas] Project Management Agcy, German Aeorspace Ctr DLR, Bonn, Germany; [Schaefer, Mike S.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Schmidt, A (corresponding author), Project Management Agcy, German Aeorspace Ctr DLR, Bonn, Germany.",andreas.schmidt@dlr.de,"Schafer, Mike S./F-7238-2010; Schmidt, Andreas/J-3290-2013","Schafer, Mike S./0000-0002-0847-7503; Schmidt, Andreas/0000-0002-2064-0027","Cluster of Excellence 'CliSAP', Universitat Hamburg, through the German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC177]; Center for a Sustainable University (University of Hamburg)","The research presented here was supported by the Cluster of Excellence 'CliSAP' (EXC177), Universitat Hamburg, funded through the German Research Foundation (DFG) and by funds from the Center for a Sustainable University (University of Hamburg).

This study aims to identify and value socio-environmental liabilities from coal mining at different stages of the coal life cycle. Environmental liabilities can be operationalized under three types of responsibilities: moral, legal, and economic. The identification of environmental liabilities allocates moral responsibility; the legal responsibility is needed for effective reparation; and the economic valuation provides arguments to claim compensation, seek remediation, and mitigation of damages. To identify socio-environmental liabilities, interviews were conducted and environmental mining conflicts were analyzed. To estimate monetary values, data were linked to existing literature on costs associated with damages. Results show that the economic values of socio-environmental liabilities per ton of extracted and exported coal are higher than the market price of coal. The main socio-environmental liabilities arise from pollution, local health deterioration, water table depletion, land and ecosystem services losses, damages from transportation and shipping, and coal reserve loss. A comparison with studies in China and the United States indicates that values increase when other health impacts and climate change on a global scale are included. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, these often treat issues of power and justice in relatively unproblematic ways, without considering whether their activities will entrench existing relationships or whether they have the potential to achieve more transformative change. This paper examines the capacity strengthening initiatives undertaken in two cities within the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) - Bandar Lampung (Indonesia) and Hat Yai (Thailand) - to assess how ideas of power and justice have been incorporated. It examines the ways in which these activities are perceived to generate particular benefits, but also explores how the process and content were defined, and the ways in which different stake-holders participated in them. By doing so, it assesses both the procedural elements of capacity building (who is involved, how they are selected) and the distributional elements (how the outcomes of capacity building programmes affect different groups). These elements of justice can be both implicit and explicit, but need to be engaged with more critically if the processes and outcomes are to contribute to more transformative patterns of urban resilience.

For cities aiming to address the impacts of climate change in a proactive sense as well as post-disaster, urban resilience presents itself as a useful frame, grounded in both ecological systems theory and psychological theory. This chapter tackles the question of where the notion of resilience helps, and where it holds cities back, in terms of urban planning and policy. Resilience in the urban planning and policy context may hold cities back because it lacks normative value in social and political spheres. That is, while concepts such as social justice and sustainable development suggest a normative direction for planning toward the improvement of our communities, resilience thinking does not imply any value-based criteria by which communities might determine how best to bounce back or bounce forward. Additional tools for urban resilience planning are needed, and we suggest and elaborate here upon two: the development path and regenerative sustainability. The notion of the development path originated within the IPCC process and draws upon futures studies, scenario planning and backcasting, in order to understand the social and political change and decision making implications of responding to climate change. The second concept we offer, regenerative sustainability, can be considered as the work of increasing the capacity of the current generation to give back more than we receive. The contribution of these two concepts to the value of urban resilience thinking in political contexts is explained through a discussion of five possible scenarios of urban transformation, which vary in terms of the social and political intentions at work in the strategies needed to build resilience.","[Holden, Meg] Simon Fraser Univ, Urban Studies & Geog, 2nd Floor,515 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada; [Robinson, John] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, 315 Bloor St W,Room 202, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada; [Robinson, John] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, 315 Bloor St W,Room 202, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada; [Sheppard, Stephen] Univ British Columbia, Collaborat Adv Landscape Planning & Urban Forestr, Forest Sci Ctr 2045, 2424,Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Holden, M (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Urban Studies & Geog, 2nd Floor,515 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada.",mholden@sfu.ca,,,,,,64,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1613-5113,2363-9466,978-3-319-39812-9; 978-3-319-39810-5,ADV SCI TECH SEC APP,,,2016,,,,,,,295,319,,10.1007/978-3-319-39812-9_15,10.1007/978-3-319-39812-9,,25,Urban Studies,Urban Studies,BI2EK,WOS:000408903300016,,,,,2021-08-07,

In the initial few years following the flood event, many predicted New Orleans would be whitened (Fussell E, Sastry N, VanLandingham M, Popul Environ 31(1):20-42,2010) as displaced black residents did not have the means to return and seemingly would never be able to return (Logan JR, The impact of Katrina: race and class in storm-damaged neighborhoods. Unpublished manuscript. Spatial structures in the social sciences initiative, Brown University, 2006; Horne J, Five myths about Hurricane Katrina, The Washington Post, 31 August, 2012). However, although black residents have returned at much slower rates (Fussell E, Sastry N, VanLandingham M, Popul Environ 31(1):20-42,2010), the feared whitening of New Orleans has not come to fruition, preserving much of the cultural characteristics of the city.","[Lascell, Wendy A.] SUNY Coll Oneonta, Dept Geog, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA","Lascell, WA (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Oneonta, Dept Geog, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA.",Wendy.Lascell@oneonta.edu,,,,,,37,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-319-26218-5; 978-3-319-26216-1,GEOTECH ENVIRON,,,2016,14,,,,,,185,199,,10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5_12,10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5,,15,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering,BH1MG,WOS:000398203700012,,,,,2021-08-07,

The Early Development Of Adult Basic Education In NSW Through The Lens Of Professional Practice Theory,LITERACY AND NUMERACY STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The field of adult basic education had its genesis as a named field of education in the English speaking world in the mid-1970s, emerging from humanist discourses of social justice and a sociocultural view of literacy. Subsequent decades of its development have involved recurrent and destabilising periods of change with a major and overriding theme being the move away from the humanist philosophy, towards an economically driven, human capital view of literacy, which mirrors the story of a number of other social programs in their trajectory towards the 'new capitalism'. This paper considers the first fifteen years, or genesis, of the field of adult basic education in the state of New South Wales in Australia through official documents and archival material and through the stories from practice told by the teachers. Analysis of these stories using a theory of professional practice knowledge demonstrates the ways in which the early field of professional practice emerged as a product of its particular socio-political climate, and demonstrates also the strong convergence between the public discourses and the professional discourses surrounding the field in this period; a convergence which was progressively weakened in subsequent decades.",,,posmond8@bigpond.com,,,,,,35,5,5,0,3,"UNIV TECHNOLOGY, SYDNEY-UTS EPRESS",SYDNEY,"BROADWAY, PO BOX 123, SYDNEY, NSW 2007, AUSTRALIA",1441-0559,1839-2903,,LIT NUMER STUD,Lit.

EUE theory postulates a net flow of natural resources from peripheral developing to core industrialized countries through international trade, a situation which undermines the development of the periphery while enhancing that of the core. The key claims and EUE mechanisms are categorized and discussed under three topics: 1) the structure of the capitalist world-economy, 2) monetary valuation, and 3) equity and justice. The treadmill logic of capitalism in which capital extracts ecological resources and release waste in an endless pursuit of profits creates an expansionary dynamic which draws peripheral countries into exploitative market relations. This peripheralization is supported by 'free trade' economic policies, while nation-states and other political-economic institutions such as the WTO and IMF provide the regulations which ensure proper functioning of the system. Monetary valuation caps it by obscuring the inverse relationship between thermodynamics and economics, in which low-entropy energy and materials indispensable in economic production processes are lowly priced while processed goods which have dissipated most of their matterenergy are highly priced, ensuring that biophysical resources and profits accumulates in the industrialized Northern countries. This EUE framework is applied to the EU's Raw Materials Initiative from the vantage point of policy as implicit theory. By challenging mainstream policies and their underlying theories, the EUE perspective demonstrates that alternatives to neoliberal policy prescriptions exist and policy can play a crucial role in bringing about the necessary structural changes.","[Oulu, Martin] Lund Univ, Human Ecol Div, Lund, Sweden","Oulu, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Human Ecol Div, Lund, Sweden.",ochiengmoulu@gmail.com,,,Lund University; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [266642],"Dr. Martin Oulu, Associate Researcher, Human Ecology Division, Lund University, Sweden and Inscape Research & Consulting, Nairobi, Kenya.

The urban poor in most parts of Kinshasa bear a huge encumbrance of the solid waste burden and face multiple challenges associated with poor management of solid waste. This situation has resulted in poor and unhealthy living conditions for the majority of the urban residents. The problem of solid waste management in Kinshasa has further been compounded by rapid urbanisation which has occurred in the face of poor urban governance, civil conflict and weak institutional set-up. The combination of these challenges has resulted in increased overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, lack of water and an unprecedented accumulation of solid waste which have triggered a myriad of urban problems. The worst affected are the poor urban who reside in locations that receive little or no socio-economic services from the Kinshasa Municipal authority. Using secondary data collected through a desk study, this paper argues that the poor solid waste situation in Kinshasa is not only a health risk, but also presents issues of both social and environmental injustices. These issues are analysed within the context of evolving arguments that focus on the need to develop a pro-poor approach in solid waste management that may present an opportunity for achieving both social and environmental justice for the urban poor in Kinshasa.","[Kubanza, Nzalalemba Serge; Simatele, Danny] Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, P-B 1, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Simatele, Danny] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Siyakhana Initiat Ecol Hlth & Food Secur, Fac Hlth Sci, P-B 1, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa","Simatele, D (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, P-B 1, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.; Simatele, D (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Siyakhana Initiat Ecol Hlth & Food Secur, Fac Hlth Sci, P-B 1, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",danny.simatele@wits.ac.za,"Simatele, Mulala Danny/AAS-9958-2020","Simatele, Mulala Danny/0000-0002-2161-1586",NRF for a KIC research grant of ZAR,"The authors are deeply indebted to the NRF for a KIC research grant of ZAR 19,000 awarded to Dr Danny Simatele on 20 March 2014 to support the conference and research activities of Mr. Serge Kubanza, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, at the University of the Witwatersrand.",,69,20,21,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,7,,,,,866,882,,10.1080/13549839.2015.1038985,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,EG7UZ,WOS:000391263200005,,,,,2021-08-07,

B., et al., 2011. The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change mitigation policies in California. Climatic Change, 109 (Suppl. 1), S485-S503]. The climate and poverty relationship is examined using multi-scaled analysis across three indicators of climate vulnerability, focusing on connections to health, food, and energy during the period 2010-2012. We provide an overview of climate-related social vulnerability in the Southwest based on available federal, state, and county-level census data. We then summarise the results from a stakeholder workshop and in-depth interviews about climate vulnerabilities with social service providers in southern Arizona. We identify a significant Southwest climate gap based on census data and interview findings about climate vulnerability especially relating to high levels of poverty, health disparities, and increasing costs for energy, water, and food. We find that grassroots and community organisations have mobilised to respond to climate and social vulnerability, yet resources for mitigation and adaptation are insufficient given the high level of need. Confronting a changing climate that is projected to be hotter, drier, and with the potential to reach new thresholds, we suggest that more research needs to be done to understand the social and spatial characteristics of climate risk and how low-income populations embody and experience climate risk, and adapt to a changing climate.","[Wilder, Margaret; Liverman, Diana; Bellante, Laurel; Osborne, Tracey] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Wilder, Margaret] Univ Arizona, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Liverman, Diana] Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Liverman, Diana] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England","Wilder, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Wilder, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mwilder@email.arizona.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Climate Program Office of the US Global Change Research Program's National Climate Assessment [NA07OAR4310382]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1243125] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,We are grateful to support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Climate Program Office [grant number NA07OAR4310382] to the Climate Assessment for the Southwest program at the University of Arizona in support of the US Global Change Research Program's National Climate Assessment.,,62,5,5,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,11,,,,,1332,1353,,10.1080/13549839.2015.1116063,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,EG7VM,WOS:000391264500003,,,,,2021-08-07,

Yet scholars are just beginning to investigate how climate policies are impacting social equity in practice. This paper contributes concrete examples and a multiscalar analysis to this emerging understanding. As cities are increasingly important players in global climate governance, it examines cases from three cities in the global North that have made notable attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a socially just way: Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, England; and Vancouver, British Columbia. These cases show that there is significant potential for cities to further global climate justice through emission reductions while enhancing social justice locally. However, they also demonstrate the importance of understanding just carbon mitigation as a multiscalar phenomenon. In each of these cities, leaders' abilities to mitigate climate change in a just way are shaped by larger processes of changing global markets, political opportunities and constraints, and inconsistent national regulatory environments. To the extent that cities continue to act as important sites of the carbon mitigation necessary to achieve global climate justice, this research highlights the necessity of creating national and global political conditions that enable the implementation of just climate mitigation in urban areas.","[McKendry, Corina] Colorado Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA","McKendry, C (corresponding author), Colorado Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA.",corina.mckendry@coloradocollege.edu,,,Colorado College Social Science Executive Committee; Mrachek Fellowship for Early Career Scholars,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 49th annual meeting of the International Studies Association on 19 February 2015.

However, we still have a hard time determining exactly the impact of climate change on the environment or the damage that climate change inflicts on countries comprising small islands or low-lying lands in light of today's science and technology. The progress for dealing with the issue of loss and damage has been struggling for a long time from the beginning to the present. In this paper, the author begins by summarizing talks on the concept and the positions of commentators. The author is proposing that the development of future climate negotiations and rule-making process be based on global climate justice as a standard for measuring value. Also, the author proposes that a holistic view of climate justice be established. Generally, three aspects of climate justice can be derived. First, the dimension of human rights protection shows that protection of fundamental human rights is a logical precondition if small-island and low-lying countries are able to achieve climate justice. Second, the definite and traditional concepts of distributive justice and corrective justice hold the view that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should be upheld as a basic standard of allocating rights and duties associated with climate change. Third, climate justice requires that any state follow the no-harm principle, which is regarded as an international customary rule. According to the principle, the obligation of states to prevent the use of their territory for causing trans-boundary harm to the environment shall be a violation of state responsibility, which incurs international punishment. Then we put forward three remedial approaches in light of climate justice, including the approach of State Responsibility (SR) based on the principles and rules of international human rights law and international environmental law. Based on clear rules, the judge can determine whether the damaging behavior or the damage perpetrated by a state party constitutes a state responsibility. The International Environmental Regulation (IEB), which means solving the problems within the framework established by the Conventions on Climate Change, takes advantage of the market mechanisms and incentives such as fund and insurance support system to relieve or compensate the loss and damage. International Environmental Dispute Settlement Mechanism (IEDSM), which includes the means such as consultations, negotiations, nonmandatory ways and international arbitration, international judicial ways to solve these disputes, functions as a procedural safeguard. As an active promoter of global climate governance, China should no doubt stand by the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) and take it as a basis for negotiations, actively strengthen the work of South-South cooperation, fulfill her international climate commitments without reservation, vigorously develop a low-carbon economy, and actively promote international negotiations on the subject of loss and damage.","[Cao, Mingde; Wang, Qi; Cheng, Yu] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Civil Commercial & Econ Law Sch, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China","Wang, Q (corresponding author), China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Civil Commercial & Econ Law Sch, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.",nanyangwangqi@163.com,,,,,,20,6,6,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1004-2857,2325-4262,,CHIN J POPUL RESOUR,Chin.

J,"Morrow, DR",,,,"Morrow, David R.",,,Climate Sins of Our Fathers? Historical Accountability in Distributing Emissions Rights,ETHICS POLICY & ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,JUSTICE; DEBT,"One major question in climate justice is whether developed countries' historical emissions are relevant to distributing the burdens of mitigating climate change. To argue that developed countries should bear a greater share of the burdens of mitigation because of their past emissions is to advocate 'historical accountability.' Standard arguments for historical accountability rely on corrective justice. These arguments face important objections. By using the notion of a global emissions budget, however, we can reframe the debate over historical accountability in terms of distributive justice. This paper argues that, given two defensible assumptions, distributive justice requires historical accountability. These assumptions are that the proper claimants on the emissions budgets are societies or states, not individuals, and that we should be allocating the entirety of the original, pre-industrial budget, rather than just the remainder.","[Morrow, David R.] George Mason Univ, Inst Philosophy & Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Morrow, DR (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Inst Philosophy & Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dmorrow2@gmu.edu,,"Morrow, David/0000-0002-2025-429X",,,,35,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2155-0085,2155-0093,,ETHICS POLICY ENV,Ethics Policy Env.,,2016,19,3,,,,,335,349,,10.1080/21550085.2016.1226240,,,15,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EC0CN,WOS:000387765600007,,,,,2021-08-07,

There is also an expanding literature that is highly skeptical of this research. Critics point out that (1) this research has so far produced widely divergent findings, and that there is no consensus on a causal link between climate and the incidence of conflict. Critics also argue that much climate violence research (2) draws upon a long discredited environmental determinism, (3) rehashes colonial stereotypes of the global South, (4) naturalizes and depoliticizes inequalities within and between nations, and (5) potentially creates new rationales for militarism and intervention from more powerful states. In the following essay, I build on these critiques, arguing that orthodox climate conflict research also focuses unduly on the potential climate-related violence of the poor, overlooking the violence of the powerful. Drawing from a climate justice perspective, I advocate for more study on the structural violence of climate change. To make this case, I focus on the world's largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies.","[Bonds, Eric] Univ Mary Washington, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Fredericksburg, VA 22401 USA","Bonds, E (corresponding author), Univ Mary Washington, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Fredericksburg, VA 22401 USA.",ebonds@umw.edu,,,,,,68,6,6,0,21,SOC HUMAN ECOLOGY,BAR HARBOR,"105 EDEN ST, BAR HARBOR, ME 04609 USA",1074-4827,,,HUM ECOL REV,Hum.

The current impasse over taking action may lie in the very different ways people view the world and their place in it. The aim is to explore some profound contradictions within differing strands of knowledge feeding into common understandings of climate justice. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review of appropriate peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted with a view to defining the term climate justice. Findings - In addition to there being no single, clear definition of climate justice, a fundamental schism was found between what indigenous peoples want to see happen and what industrialised nations can do with respect to both the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. Research limitations/implications - One limitation to defining climate justice, and reason for publishing, is the lack of peer-reviewed work on this topic. Practical implications - This paper has many practical implications, the most fundamental of which is the need to reach a consensus over rights to the Earth's resources. If humanity, within which there are many societies, chooses to follow a truly equitable path post 2015, industrialised countries and corporations will need to move away from endless growth economics. The ways in which climate justice might be operationalised in future are considered, including the concept of a climate-justice checklist. Originality/value - While the reconciliation proposed in this paper might be considered idealistic, unless it is acknowledged the Earth's resources are limited, over-exploited and for all people to use sustainably, thus requiring a reduction in consumption by individuals relatively affluent in global terms, climate negotiators will continue talking about the same issues without achieving meaningful change.","[Meikle, Mandy; Wilson, Jake; Jafry, Tahseen] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Jafry, T (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",t.jafry@gcu.ac.uk,,"Jafry, Tahseen/0000-0003-1191-0029",,,,57,7,7,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The original fellowships drew on sociology, economics, geography, psychology and international relations. Cross-cutting themes of rights, risks and responsibilities were identified following a series of workshops. Results of these workshops were discussed in a number of policy fora. Analysis of the feedback from that fora is used to propose the case for a rights, risks and responsibilities approach to building a more accessible climate justice debate. Findings - Existing climate policy unjustly displaces a) responsibility for emission reductions, b) risks from climate impacts and c) loss of rights. Foundational questions of acceptable risk have been ignored and a just climate policy requires procedurally just ways of revisiting this first-order question. Research limitations/implications - The contribution a rights, risks and responsibilities framework can bring to a process of educating for climate stewardship is at this stage theoretical. It is only through trialling a rights, risks and responsibilities approach to climate justice debates with the relevant stakeholders that its true potential can be assessed. Practical implications - Policy actors expressed strong resistance to the idea of overhauling current decision-making processes and policy frameworks. However, moving forward from this point with a more nuanced and tactical understanding of the dialectical relationship between rights, risks and responsibilities has the potential to improve those processes. Social implications - Educating for climate stewardship will be more effective if it adopts an approach which seeks a co-production of knowledge. Beginning with the foundational question of what counts as an acceptable level of climate risk offers an inclusive entry point into the debate. Originality/value - Reveals limits to public engagement with climate policy generated by a 'justice' framing.","[Shaw, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England","Shaw, C (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.",C.J.Shaw@sussex.ac.uk,,,ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC),"The results discussed in this paper emerged out of the ESRC-funded Climate Crunch project, which ran from May 2013 to May 2014.

Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical analysis is provided regarding the conditions for creating a club for climate change mitigation. Indicators of good governance and trust, as well as the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN), are used to assess the capacity for creating such a club. Findings - While opportunities for achieving climate justice are identified, climate change mitigation is likely to be at most a club good at the global level, thus excluding the most vulnerable countries, regions and groups of people. Although the threats of climate change may be acknowledged, they are easily neglected. Economic growth is likely to be a condition for economic sustainability, which in turn tends to be a condition for environmental sustainability. Decision makers should be conscious of the potential danger of creating a club for climate change mitigation based on the belief that economic growth and technology will solve these problems, as such a club is likely to be either unsustainable, or very small, while deepening existing injustice. Originality/value - The authors provide an overview of the complexity of issues involved, to gain an appreciation of the vast, perhaps insurmountable, challenges facing climate justice. A club good approach is applied to issues of climate justice, emphasizing the limitations of the all-inclusiveness of climate justice and sustainable development.","[Platje, Johannes (Joost)] WSB Univ Wroclaw, Fac Finance & Management, Wroclaw, Poland; [Kampen, Remko] Wroclaw Sch Banking, Wroclaw, Poland","Platje, J (corresponding author), WSB Univ Wroclaw, Fac Finance & Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",joost.platje@gmail.com,"Platje, Johannes/AAX-8860-2020","Platje, Johannes/0000-0002-6274-1467",,,,83,2,2,1,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

J,"Ahmed, ME",,,,"Ahmed, Mey Eltayeb",,,A gender justice approach to eliminating Sudan's Savannah belt's vulnerability to climate change,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Climate justice; Conflict; Gender approaches; REDD,,"Purpose - Arguing that a gendered invisibility surrounding climate justice contributes to the overall vulnerability and burden placed upon the ability of women from disadvantaged communities, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of developing a participative gender framework for climate justice with the potential to address the policy and programme vulnerability gap within climate change and conflict in Sudan's Savannah Belt. Design/methodology/approach - In utilising gender responsive discourse analysis, along with setting out the history of gender engagement within social forestry, this paper examines both the method of Sudan's reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) development and its content. Findings - The paper's findings demonstrate that the REDD+ programme in Sudan provides ample evidence of the importance of integrating climate justice and gender approaches to policy, programming and projects through ensuring women and local community participation at all levels and interaction within policy and programme development, along with its implementation. Research limitations/implications - The paper is theoretical in nature but did draw upon case studies and consultations, and the author was involved in some of the research. Originality/value - The paper provides a positive and arguably original example of social forestry within the Savannah Belt and its utilisation as a best practice that has fed into Sudan's REDD+ Proposal/Policy Document so as to potentially drive and streamline similar such initiatives across Sudan.",,,meyahmed@gmail.com,,,,,,33,1,1,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

It provides new insights, as examined through a climate justice lens, into the status of women and socially excluded groups in the region and, based on this, calls for re-thinking both politically and practically on how to shape future initiatives to be more gender and socially inclusive, thereby supporting the rights of the neediest. Design/methodology/approach - An overview of research and evidence is conducted on how gender and social inequality is currently being addressed in the agricultural sector through an analysis of peer reviewed and grey literature. This is followed by a synthesis which is presented as directions and recommendations for future initiatives developed through a climate justice lens. Findings - Gender and social inequality issues are rife across the IGP. This may be for many reasons including poor targeting, little capacity, lack of strategic positioning in programme and project design - all of which have enormous implications for the poorest and most marginalised communities and, especially, women. The need to conduct more gender-inclusive and socially inclusive research to enhance gender equity and equal opportunities for women and men is highlighted. The need to include a human rights-based approach to safeguarding the rights of the most vulnerable affected by climate change is indicated through the gender analysis; the finding provides some guiding principles in moving towards the new 2015 climate agreement and Post 2015 Development Goals. Originality/value - The results provide a foundation which stimulates thinking around climate justice, and the contribution this approach can make to better inform future agricultural initiatives/policies to be more gender-inclusive and socially inclusive.","[Jafry, Tahseen] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Jafry, T (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",t.jafry@gcu.ac.uk,,"Jafry, Tahseen/0000-0003-1191-0029",CGIAR CIMMYT CRP WHEATCGIAR,"The author would like to acknowledge the funding contribution from the CGIAR CIMMYT CRP WHEAT in relation to the finding of this paper, in particular to Dr Lone Badstue, Strategic Leader for Gender Research CIMMYT.

The first concerns the movement's normative and political relationship to non-human nature: climate change in particular is forcing an urgent reconsideration of how nature is to be understood and managed. The second problem concerns the implications of full recognition of the rights of First Peoples for environmental justice. These issues may lead to crises of identity, legitimacy, and effectiveness for the Australian movement. The normative bases upon which Australian environmentalists may draw in order to protect nature' in the Anthropocene are discussed. Setting aside the simple emancipatory ambition of preservationist environmentalism and the Australian movement's earlier Romantic protectionism, a new pragmatic, pluralistic environmental politics - based on precaution, the avoidance of pain and suffering, and protection of the most vulnerable - is suggested.","[Christoff, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Christoff, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",peterac@unimelb.edu.au,,"CHRISTOFF, PETER/0000-0002-7826-2401",,,,71,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

First, regional planning agencies and environmental justice advocates are engaged in conflicts over not only the content of regional climate change plans, but the very definitions of region and the authority used to put these regional visions into action. Second, regional organizing provides environmental justice movements with new opportunities to address regional economic patterns and to negotiate with regional planning agencies, both of which influence local manifestations of environmental injustice. Third, regional strategies raise significant dilemmas for these movements as they try to sustain engagement across extensive spatial territories and engage with a broad set of policy and economic protagonists. Together, this analysis demonstrates that a dynamic approach to regions, regionalism, and regionalization can assist political ecology and environmental justice scholars in their common aim of understanding the co-production of social and environmental inequity and collective action to change it.","[London, Jonathan K.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Community & Reg Dev, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [London, Jonathan K.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Reg Change, Davis, CA 95616 USA","London, JK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Community & Reg Dev, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; London, JK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Reg Change, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jklondon@ucdavis.edu,,"London, Jonathan/0000-0001-5478-0880",National Institute for Food and Agriculture and the Resources Legacy Fund,"I would like to thank the National Institute for Food and Agriculture and the Resources Legacy Fund for partial funding for this project, my UC Davis collaborators Catherine Garoupa White, Dana Rowangould, Alex Karner and Chris Benner, and our many community partners in the regional equity movements for their support.

More recently, the concept of energy justice has gained prominence, most frequently framed in terms of access to affordable energy and fuel poverty but also related to the politics of energy infrastructures. To date however, there has been little critical interrogation of energy justice in relation to actions undertaken by activist and advocacy movements. In this paper, we set out an analysis of the concept of 'energy justice' from the perspective of framing. Drawing on research with organisations in Philadelphia, Paris and Berlin, the paper explores the articulation and elaboration of an energy justice frame. In so doing, it explores how such actors strategically frame their interpretation of energy justice, considers the overall emergence of an energy justice frame, and draws out an agenda for future research.

The aim of this study was to propose a new framework to address the health consequences of environmental exposures beyond 2015. This framework is transdisciplinary and precautionary. It is based on identifying social and economic determinants of health, strengthening primary health systems, and improving the health of vulnerable populations. It incorporates deliberate plans for assessment and control of avoidable environmental exposures.

This chapter addresses the complex relationship between these two policy domains, their scientific background and the related acceptability issue, which varies substantially among countries and social groups and is influenced by social and cultural factors. The first section of this chapter describes the relationship between air quality and climate change policies. Indeed, global CO2 reduction objectives require complex adaptations of socio-economic behaviours that might not directly appear to be related to pollution reduction or to improvement the exposure of citizens to harmful pollutants. Recent studies, however, have confirmed that air pollution and its impacts are one of the main environmental concerns for citizens, even if relevant differences in public perception between countries still remain. This section also addresses the ambiguities and conflicts that characterise communication between experts and citizens. The second section briefly describes recent scientific evidence that shows the possibility of coupling air quality and climate change mitigation benefits with policies targeted at specific pollutants called short lived climate forcers (SLCF). The third section spells out some preliminary research questions on the acceptability of these policies and their complex relationship with individual interests and cultural contexts. Linking air quality to climate change could be a win-win strategy to increase the social acceptability of specific policies and their implementation if knowledge and communication gaps between citizens and policy makers will be reduced.","[Sergi, Vittorio; Giardullo, Paolo; Maione, Michela] Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Kazepov, Yuri] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria","Sergi, V (corresponding author), Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",vittorio.sergi@uniurb.it,"Giardullo, Paolo/AAQ-1455-2021","Giardullo, Paolo/0000-0002-2560-9088; KAZEPOV, Yuri Albert Kyrill/0000-0002-7586-3850",,,,82,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-2010,,978-3-319-24660-4; 978-3-319-24658-1,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2016,,,,,,,89,106,,10.1007/978-3-319-24660-4_6,10.1007/978-3-319-24660-4,,18,Economics; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BE8JS,WOS:000376523200007,,,,,2021-08-07,

We analyse several college divestment campaigns to illuminate key factors that have contributed to wins and rejections, and explore why students continue to organise for FFD. It is our contention that such widespread mobilisation for FFD signals a sea change, from individualised sustainability efforts to youth-led collective political action, and recognition of climate change as a social justice issue. In addition to participant observation, we gathered data from 23 survey responses of organisers involved in divestment campaigns within higher education, and 40 interviews with individuals including student and professional organisers within the FFD movement, institutional decision-makers at campuses with FFD campaigns, and other experts in the area. Our analysis also reveals that relatively smaller endowments and, more importantly, institutional values of environmental sustainability and social justice played key roles in colleges' decision to divest. Our examination of divestment losses illuminates common arguments administrators deploy in their rejection statements, including the perceived costs of divestment, the need to maintain fiduciary responsibility, and scepticism that divestment will have any impact on the fossil fuel industry. Finally, in spite of increasing resistance from college and university administrations, student divestment campaigns continue to escalate, and are committed to organising over the long term.","[Grady-Benson, Jessica] Responsible Endowments Coalit, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Sarathy, Brinda] Pitzer Coll, Environm Anal, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Sarathy, B (corresponding author), Pitzer Coll, Environm Anal, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",brinda_sarathy@pitzer.edu,,,,,,55,35,35,3,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,6,,,,,661,681,,10.1080/13549839.2015.1009825,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,DP0HW,WOS:000378171500001,,,,,2021-08-07,

We analyzed 215 research articles, spanning four decades and representing 71 countries, and which engaged a range of methodologies. Our analysis combines quantification of geographic and methodological trends with qualitative analysis of content-based themes. Significant findings included temporal spikes in published policy research occurring in the mid-1970s, late 1990s, and after 2005, as well as geographic under-representation of Africa, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, and North and West Asia. The majority of articles reviewed were non-empirical; empirical articles overwhelmingly focused on teaching and learning directives, rather than exploring the complexity of policy development or enactment. We conclude our analysis by describing key research gaps as highlighted by the review and propose directions for moving forward policy research in environmental and sustainability education. In particular, we suggest greater research attention to critical policy theory and methodology, issues of intersectionality, and climate change education policy research. By outlining in greater detail the policy research that has been undertaken to date, the review provides a platform for a broadened diversity of policy studies in environmental and sustainability education.","[Aikens, Kathleen] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [McKenzie, Marcia] Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Fdn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Vaughter, Philip] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, UNU Ctr, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Aikens, K (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",kathleen.aikens@usask.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [895-2011-1025],This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 895-2011-1025].,,109,62,62,2,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

The critical missing link was the absence of a social/human aspect to water resources and its relation to the human society. Access to water resources revolved predominantly around the health and livelihood needs of the society. Multiple values that a society could derive from its access to water were ignored. This limited focus on access to water coupled with a growing problem of water scarcity gave birth to a new phenomenon of considering water as an 'economic good'. This commoditization of water meant water was provided based on the ability to pay and efficiency of use, thus further alienated the social value of water. Furthermore, the link between water and society can also be viewed from a hazards perspective. With the increasing awareness of climate change and water related hazards, view of water based upon assumption of average normal conditions is no longer tenable. Building resilience and adaptation capacity to address water hazards must involve a fundamental shift towards a planning paradigm that works inwards from extremes rather than outward from means. With this background, the objective of the chapter is to review water research literature through the tri-focal lens of Access, Equity and Hazards and attempt to identify the gaps - when the water resources field is viewed through this tri-focallens. To set the stage, the chapter will first briefly discuss the rationale for the choice of our tri-focal analytical lens before delving into the international academic and policy literature to address the aforementioned objectives.","[Mirza, M.

Here, we report evidence that through status and group-based social influence processes, and our moral sense of justice, it may be possible to employ such characteristics of the human mind in efforts to engender pro-environmental action. We draw on applied work demonstrating the efficacy of social modeling techniques in order to examine the indirect effects of social model status and group membership (through perceptions of efficacy, pro-environmental social identity and moral judgments of how fair it is for individuals to perform particular pro-environmental actions) on pro-environmental action tendencies. We find evidence that high- (vs. low-) status models increase pro-environmental action, in part, through making such actions seem morally fairer to undertake. This effect of high-status models only occurs when they share a meaningful ingroup membership with the target of influence. Further, we find evidence that this conditional effect of high-status models may also have a direct impact on action tendencies. While the exact behaviors that are influenced may vary across student and non-student samples, we argue that a focus on the justice pathway to action and the social-cognitive features of models may offer a good opportunity for cognitive and behavioral scientists to integrate insights from basic research with those stemming from more applied research efforts.","[Sweetman, Joseph] Univ Exeter, Psychol, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Whitmarsh, Lorraine E.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales","Sweetman, J (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Psychol, Exeter EX4 4QG, Devon, England.",j.p.sweetman@exeter.ac.uk,"Whitmarsh, Lorraine/AAD-3756-2019; Whitmarsh, Lorraine/A-1611-2010","Whitmarsh, Lorraine/0000-0002-9054-1040; Whitmarsh, Lorraine/0000-0002-9054-1040",,,,51,7,7,1,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1756-8757,1756-8765,,TOP COGN SCI,Top.

However, several socioeconomic, demographic and geographic processes may render the access to GS challenging. Moreover, it is often critical to know what type of GS service to develop at a specific place. Also, measurements accuracy issues could be critical for planning and decision making. As an example of what could happen in many other cities of different sizes, we modeled and compared the access to GS, including several of their specific functions, in the Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) of Montreal and Quebec City in Canada. We used the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) (average of 3 million people per year over 1996-2011) to measure over time, the proximity of each individual to the closest GS boundary using travel costs and spatial interaction models. ANOVA models and their corresponding base regressions were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the relationship of GS distances and surface to density, deprivation, gender and age, including interaction terms. The spatial clustering of the reduction of distances to GS was evaluated on a chronological basis. Unlike the larger CMA of Montreal, Quebec City CMA showed greater equity in access to GS, largely due to the specific geographic insertion of linear GS. The CMA of Montreal showed an improvement in the access to GS which benefits the wealthy in the densest areas on the island of Montreal. Everything happens as if a green gentrification process affects the access to GS in Montreal. Our results suggest that for the promotion of GS as an important element of primary prevention in public health, both the quality or functions of GS and the geographic determinants of their access are of higher importance than a simple consideration of total GS surface per capita as often used by decision makers or public health promoters. They also underline the limits of standard measurements of attraction and accessibility and the complexity for large cities to promote environmental justice, given the complexity of their socio-demographic processes.

The literature on environmental equity focuses especially on the distribution of nuisances and resources, which, because of the unequal spatial distribution of different social groups, leads to an increased exposure to risks or to less access to beneficial elements for certain populations. Little work has been done on the multidimensionality of different environmental burdens and the lack of resources in some urban environments. This article has two main objectives. The first objective is to construct an environmental equity index that takes into consideration seven components of the urban environment (traffic-related pollutants, proximity to major roads and highways, vegetation, access to parks, access to supermarkets, and the urban heat island effect). The second objective is to determine whether groups vulnerable to different nuisances-namely, individuals under fifteen years old and the elderly-and those who tend to be located in the most problematic areas according to the environmental justice literature (i.e., visible minorities and low-income populations) are affected by environmental inequities associated with the application of the composite index at the city block level. The results obtained by using four statistical techniques show that, on the Island of Montreal, low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities are more frequently located in city blocks close to major roads and with higher concentrations of NO2 and less vegetation. Finally, the environmental equity index is significantly lower in areas with high concentrations of low-income populations in comparison with the wealthiest areas.","[Carrier, Mathieu] Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H2X 0A9, Canada; [Apparicio, Philippe; Seguin, Anne-Marie] Natl Inst Sci Res, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, Montreal, PQ H2X 2C6, Canada; [Kestens, Yan; Siemiatycki, Jack] Univ Montreal, Ecole Sante Publ, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Montreal, PQ H2X 0A9, Canada; [Pham, Hien] Univ Quebec, Dept Urban Studies, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada; [Crouse, Dan] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Sociol, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada","Carrier, M (corresponding author), Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H2X 0A9, Canada.",mathieu.carrier@ucs.inrs.ca; philippe.apparicio@ucs.inrs.ca; yan.kestens@umontreal.ca; anne-marie.seguin@ucs.inrs.ca; pham.thi_thanh_hien@uqam.ca; dan.crouse@unb.ca; j.siemiatycki@umontreal.ca,"Crouse, Dan/AAL-1267-2020; Apparicio, Philippe/K-6086-2013","Crouse, Dan/0000-0002-8824-3108; Carrier, Mathieu/0000-0002-8455-4566; Apparicio, Philippe/0000-0001-6466-9342",,,,115,6,7,4,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

The urgent discussion of how to bring about alterations in human energy usage and economic production in order to mitigate the social and ecosystemic harm done by climate change calls for a bioethics voice. But bioethics will not be able to make this contribution if it merely addresses climate change as one more in a series of problems or dilemmas. The nature of the climate change challenge is such that bioethics will have to alter fundamentally its discourse and broaden its moral horizons. This chapter argues that bioethics should become more discerning and insightful concerning matters of political power and economics. It will also do well to establish new ties and overlapping perspectives with the ecological sciences. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the structure and the logic of the encounter between bioethics-understood as a particular kind of discourse-and climate change-understood as a systemic challenge to human and ecological health. Extended consideration is given to what needs to be added to the conceptual range of bioethics in its engagement with climate change, with particular emphasis on the concepts of autonomy, membership, and solidarity.","[Jennings, Bruce] Ctr Humans & Nat, Bioeth, Chicago, IL 60606 USA; [Jennings, Bruce] Vanderbilt Univ, Hlth Policy, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Jennings, Bruce] Hastings Ctr, Garrison, NY 10524 USA","Jennings, B (corresponding author), Ctr Humans & Nat, Bioeth, Chicago, IL 60606 USA.; Jennings, B (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Hlth Policy, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.; Jennings, B (corresponding author), Hastings Ctr, Garrison, NY 10524 USA.",brucejennings@humansandnature.org,,,,,,77,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-6680,2211-6699,978-3-319-26167-6; 978-3-319-26165-2,PUB HEALTH ETHICS AN,,,2016,4,,,,,,11,37,,10.1007/978-3-319-26167-6_2,10.1007/978-3-319-26167-6,,27,"Ethics; Environmental Studies; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics","Social Sciences - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics",BJ1TQ,WOS:000418031000004,,,,,2021-08-07,

In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning.","[Kabisch, Nadja; Bonn, Aletta] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Leipzig, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja; Bonn, Aletta] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja; Haase, Dagmar] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Frantzeskaki, Niki] Erasmus Univ, DRIFT Dutch Res Inst Transit, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Pauleit, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Naumann, Sandra; Davis, McKenna] Inst Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Artmann, Martina] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Dresden, Germany; [Artmann, Martina] Salzburg Univ, Res Grp Urban & Landscape Ecol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Knapp, Sonja] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Commun Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Korn, Horst; Stadler, Jutta] German Fed Agcy Nat Conservat, Bonn, Germany; [Zaunberger, Karin] Commiss European Communities, Environm Directorate Gen, Brussels, Belgium; [Bonn, Aletta] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Kabisch, N (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Leipzig, Germany.; Kabisch, N (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.; Kabisch, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany.",,"Bonn, Aletta/A-2164-2013; Frantzeskaki, Niki/AAN-1044-2021; Knapp, Sonja/D-5989-2015; Kabisch, Nadja/ABE-6198-2020","Bonn, Aletta/0000-0002-8345-4600; Frantzeskaki, Niki/0000-0002-6983-448X; Knapp, Sonja/0000-0001-5792-4691; Kabisch, Nadja/0000-0002-8925-4423; Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720; Haase, Dagmar/0000-0003-4065-5194; Artmann, Martina/0000-0003-3119-4314","German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety [3514 80 020A]","We would like to sincerely thank all participants for their active contribution to the expert workshop on which this paper builds.

A conceptual review is now required for the consolidation and logical extension of this field. Within this exploration, we give an account of its core tenets: distributional, recognition and procedural. Later we promote the application of this three-pronged approach across the energy system, within the global context of energy production and consumption. Thus, we offer both a conceptual review and a research agenda. Throughout, we explore the key dimensions of this new agenda - its evaluative and normative reach-demonstrating that energy justice offers, firstly, an opportunity to explore where injustices occur, developing new processes of avoidance and remediation and recognizing new sections of society. Secondly, we illustrate that energy justice provides a new stimulating framework for bridging existing and future research on energy production and consumption when whole energy systems approaches are integrated into research designs.

They prefer to address individuals as citizens rather than as consumers, and focus on collective rather than individual change. Two prominent movements in this regard are Transition Towns and Climate Justice Action. While both movements criticise conventional approaches, they put forward entirely different strategies for what has to happen instead. Based on extensive qualitative research, this article analyses how these movements manifest themselves in Flanders (Belgium). The focus is on their different accounts of how and why collective practices have to be built, and the place they attribute to the political' in this. The analysis reveals the existence of two different forms of ecological citizenship: one communitarian, the other agonistic.","[Kenis, Anneleen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Heverlee, Belgium","Kenis, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Heverlee, Belgium.",Anneleen.Kenis@ees.kuleuven.be,"Kenis, Anneleen/AAV-1460-2021","Kenis, Anneleen/0000-0002-6106-6340",,,,57,26,26,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Varied expressions of political agency among young people exist, among them those responding to pressing global challenges that implicate social justice, climate change, and urbanization. Transport is one of the sectors of social and spatial life both deeply affected by and strongly influencing these particular challenges. Among some young people, several responses exist in relation to the perennial questions about how to be mobile: walk, cycle, blade, skate, practice parkour, catch public transport, drive cars, or use combinations of these modes. For some, other supports such as wheelchairs are used. This paper focuses on one of these: skateboarding. The claim that is examined here is whether, how, to what extent, and with what effects skateboarding can be (and be seen to be) both social and environmental praxis. Consideration is given to how to comprehend skateboarding as a means to mitigate and adapt to climate change, to be mobile, to claim a place in public spaces, and to strike a balance between consuming and producing wisely. What might skateboarding as social and environmental praxis reveal about youthful politics, agency, political rights, and protection, and what new insights might emerge from these reflections?","[Stratford, Elaine] Univ Tasmania, Peter Underwood Ctr Educ Attainment, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Stratford, E (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Peter Underwood Ctr Educ Attainment, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Elaine.Stratford@utas.edu.au,"Stratford, Elaine/D-1057-2010",,,,,59,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-4585-54-5; 978-981-4585-53-8,GEOGR CHILD YOUNG,,,2016,8,,,,,,531,551,,10.1007/978-981-4585-54-5_13,10.1007/978-981-4585-54-5,,21,Family Studies; Geography,Family Studies; Geography,BL2JZ,WOS:000449028100028,,,,,2021-08-07,

There are conflicts on resource extraction, transport and waste disposal. Therefore, there are many local complaints, as shown in the Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJatlas) and other inventories. And not only complaints; there are also many successful examples of stopping projects and developing alternatives, testifying to the existence of a rural and urban global movement for environmental justice. Moreover, since the 1980s and 1990s, this movement has developed a set of concepts and campaign slogans to describe and intervene in such conflicts. They include environmental racism, popular epidemiology, the environmentalism of the poor and the indigenous, biopiracy, tree plantations are not forests, the ecological debt, climate justice, food sovereignty, land grabbing and water justice, among other concepts. These terms were born from socio-environmental activism, but sometimes they have also been taken up by academic political ecologists and ecological economists who, for their part, have contributed other concepts to the global environmental justice movement, such as 'ecologically unequal exchange' or the 'ecological footprint'.","[Martinez-Alier, Joan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Quito, Ecuador; [Martinez-Alier, Joan] FLACSO, Quito, Ecuador; [Temper, Leah] Global Atlas Environm Justice EJatlas, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Temper, Leah] Seeds Survival Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Del Bene, Daniela; Scheidel, Arnim] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Scheidel, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",joanmartinezalier@gmail.com; leah.temper@gmail.com; d.delbene@gmail.com; arnim.scheidel@gmail.com,"Del Bene, Daniela/AAU-2500-2021; Scheidel, Arnim/C-3105-2018","Del Bene, Daniela/0000-0002-7879-5275; Scheidel, Arnim/0000-0001-9764-685X; Martinez-Alier, Joan/0000-0002-6124-539X","EJOLT Project, Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade, an FP7 project - European Commission [266642]; Transformations to Sustainability Programme from the International Social Science Council (ISSC) [T2S_PP_289, TKN150317115354]","This work received funding from the EJOLT Project, Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade, an FP7 project supported by the European Commission, 2011-2015 [grant number 266642]; as well as by the Transformations to Sustainability Programme from the International Social Science Council (ISSC) (Seed Grant T2S_PP_289 and Grant TKN150317115354).

Our attention to the task of mitigation, which by itself must negotiate enormous geopolitical obstacles, requires priority if we are truly concerned with alleviating the human costs of climate change. This choice of framing of the human challenges we face from climate change, however, is at odds with the standard conception of climate justice, which seeks to provide reforms to the international legal and political order to address increasing systemic inequities. What these two perspectives have in common is the recognition that climate change necessitates systemic reforms to the international order. To the extent that international law can facilitate these reforms, the question seems to be how can we better enforce equitable international obligations. This commentary asserts that the distribution of costs and benefits inherent to international regulatory standards will determine the effectiveness of any subsequent enforcement. The utility of a Climate Court, therefore, will be reflected in the ability of the operative climate treaty to produce sufficiently systemic voluntary commitments.","[Carroll, Murray] Int Court Environm Coalit, London, England; [Carroll, Murray] Global Environm Governance Project, London, England; [Carroll, Murray] Harvard Univ, Int Relat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Carroll, Murray] Univ London, Int Law, London WC1E 7HU, England","Carroll, M (corresponding author), Int Court Environm Coalit, London, England.; Carroll, M (corresponding author), Global Environm Governance Project, London, England.; Carroll, M (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Int Relat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Carroll, M (corresponding author), Univ London, Int Law, London WC1E 7HU, England.",murraycarroll@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,26,1,1,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-6811,2376-4538,,J ENERGY NAT RESO LA,J.

The most prominent pattern resulting from the analysis is that of ecological assimilation among the Mexican-origin population, with the foreign-born portion of this group being much more likely than their native-born counterparts or whites to both engage in sustainable practices and express a willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of the environment. There is evidence for a concern gap between African Americans and whites in the responses to questions tied to economic progress and standard of living reductions, though the inverted concern gap implied by the environmental justice literature is also apparent in responses to questions about perceived environmental risks where the majority of non-whites in the survey showed higher levels of concern than whites.","[Macias, Thomas] Univ Vermont, Sociol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Macias, T (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Sociol, 31 S Prospect St, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",tmacias@uvm.edu,,,,,,57,17,17,0,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

Both social scientists as well as conservationists have come to the conclusion that human activity is one of the main reasons for climate change and nature degradation, and the main target of justice related mitigation and adaptation responses. This article puts human (in)activity into focus, and introduces a social identity perspective on environmental justice. Specifically, it shows how conservation scientists can draw from the idea of a common human identity (CHI). It delineates how the representation of a common human ingroup could inform beliefs about environmental justice, which in turn should motivate individuals and groups to act in favor of the natural environment. The review highlights that social identification with all humans may represent a potential path to global environmental justice, and combines recent insights from social identity research with conservation behavior.","[Reese, Gerhard] Univ Jena, Dept Social Psychol, Humboldtstr 26, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Reese, G (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Dept Social Psychol, Humboldtstr 26, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",gerhard.reese@uni-jena.de,"Reese, Gerhard/U-9446-2019","Reese, Gerhard/0000-0001-6672-3832",,,,54,24,24,3,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

It is unlikely that this approach will be equally successful into the future because the source of conservation will shift from indoor to outdoor use. Outdoor water is climate sensitive, difficult to measure, hard to predict, linked to other components of complex and dynamic urban resource systems, imbued with behavioral and cultural dimensions, and implicated in societal conflicts about climate risk, modern lifestyles, social justice, and future growth. Outdoor water conservation is not a traditional management problem focused on the water sector, assuming a stationary climate, and set aside from public debate. Instead, outdoor water is an adaptation problem, involving complex and uncertain system dynamics, the need for cross-sector coordination, strategies for dealing with climatic uncertainty, and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders with differing goals. This paper makes the case for treating outdoor water as an adaptation problem and offers a six-point strategy for how cities can better prepare their water systems for the uncertainties of climate and societal change.","[Gober, Patricia] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gober, Patricia; Quay, Ray; Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, 126b,21 E 6th St, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Gober, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.; Gober, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Decis Ctr Desert City, 126b,21 E 6th St, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",gober@asu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0951366]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic ScieNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [0951366] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1462086] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant SES-0951366, Decision Center for a Desert City II: Urban Climate Adaptation.

Three interrelated questions motivate our analysis. First, how does the environmental risk perception of air pollution, water pollution, agricultural chemicals, climate change and nuclear power generation vary among specific categories of race and ethnicity? Second, to what degree are higher levels of perceived risk among immigrant-origin groups subject to change as a result of cultural assimilation over generations? And third, to what degree are race and ethnic differences in environmental risk perception a reflection of other possibly more significant factors such as education, income, gender and conservative political views? Though we find some evidence for attitude assimilation among generations of Mexican-origin people, the dominant pattern is greater perceived risks among non-whites than whites across generations in the U.S. Additionally, not only did race and ethnic groups show greater concern for the threats posed by climate change and nuclear power generation than whites, they also expressed more concern about these two topics than they did for more localized issues such as air pollution emanating from industry and transportation. Despite our statistical controls for socioeconomic status, race and ethnic categories remained strong independent predictors of perceived environmental threats.","[Macias, Thomas] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Macias, T (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Sociol, 31 South Prospect St, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",tmacias@uvm.edu,,,,,,57,41,41,2,62,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1468-7968,1741-2706,,ETHNICITIES,Ethnicities,FEB,2016,16,1,,,,,111,129,,10.1177/1468796815575382,,,19,Ethnic Studies,Ethnic Studies,DB5HU,WOS:000368546000006,,,,,2021-08-07,

Included in the interpretations are the nature of moments of consciously committing, the role of both concern for nature and for social justice, the dynamic and ceaseless process of committing, and the role of the youth climate movement. The discussion highlights the uniqueness of youth and of climate change in the process of committing.

In a continuing collaborative relationship, these organizers embraced mutually strategic narratives rooted in local civil rights history, but rejected common global climate justice' narratives used to frame social and environmental collaborative organizing. We examine the departure from global climate justice' narratives, which was exemplified by coalition building in Georgia, to argue that scholarship articulating global climate justice' as a new context for integrating social and environmental movements must anticipate barriers to these solidarities, especially historical, regional and racialized dynamics of power among organizations engaged in these developing alliances. Based on an investigation of strategic alliances between anti-racist, immigrant justice organizers and climate change activists in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Athens, Georgia, we argue that climate justice narratives in both activism and scholarship would benefit from more attention to the particular political and cultural geographies in which diverse forms of climate justice organizing can take hold.","[Black, Sara Thomas; Milligan, Richard Anthony; Heynen, Nik] Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Geog Geol Bldg,210 Field St,Room 204, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Black, ST (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Geog Geol Bldg,210 Field St,Room 204, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",saratomblack@gmail.com; richard.milligan@gmail.com; nheynen@uga.edu,,"Milligan, Richard/0000-0002-9161-7801",,,,47,9,9,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-1317,1468-2427,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

Approaches to addressing these issues are described from the perspective of urban governance, urban planning and design, social determinants of health, health promotion, and personal and community empowerment. Examples of successful strategies are provided from Latin America, including using participatory instruments (assessments, evaluation, participatory budgeting, etc.), establishing intersectoral committees, increasing participation of civil society organizations, and developing virtual forums and networks to channel participatory and collaborative processes. A way forward is proposed, using the urban setting to show the imperative of creating intersectoral policies and programs that produce environments that are both healthy and sustainable.

How are sovereign rights in natural resources justified? What are the implications of these rights for the demands of climate justice, which pertain to the use and management of natural resourcesfor example, rainforests? This article reviews five theories of territorial rights, in contemporary political and legal philosophy, and the justifications that they provide for territorial jurisdiction over natural resources. It is argued that insofar as the philosophical-normative perspectives justify sovereigns' jurisdiction over natural resources within their borders, they also give rise to limits on the legitimate and permissible exercise of the jurisdictional prerogative. This theoretical proposition is then illustrated in the case of international climate-justice obligations of rain-forest-rich countries.

Methods: Using a pretest-posttest design, this study examines changes in advocacy intentions around LGBTQQ issues among middle school and high school students who participated in the intervention (n = 515). Results: Students reported a significant increase in intentions to advocate. Existing intervention behaviors and increased recognition of homophobia/transphobia as problems were associated with greater increases in intention to advocate. Respondents with higher existing intervention behaviors, as well as White students and cisgender women, reported higher advocacy intentions compared to students of color and cisgender men. Further, we found indication of greater awareness of homophobia/transphobia as a problem in school.

I hope to initiate, through this paper, a different conversation concerning theories of climate justice (TCJ) in the offing and ask questions about how different TCJs may be from theories about global justice (TGJ) and environmental justice (TEJ). These approaches are all related of course - but the questions that interest me pertain to the distinctions and differences between them. Although TEJs remain tethered to domestic and regional social orderings, they generally come closer to TCJs than TGJs do. I argue here that another important difference between TEJs and TCJs concerns the notion of 'generations' in TCJs. This goes beyond the three generations (past, present and future) in most accounts of TGJ to encompass infinite generations. In addition, I examine the notion that there is a human right to do harm and the ways in which TCJ may address harm prevention as the cornerstone of a new planetary approach to justice.",,,,,,,,,195,8,8,1,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

Islanders face the prospect of forcible relocation without protection under international law and with few resources for resettlement. They are entitled to compensation for climate-related loss and damage in the interests of climate justice. The present article discusses the history of proposals for an international compensation mechanism under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change led by the Alliance of Small Island States. These calls led to the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts in 2013. Several proposals have been put forward about how a mechanism should operate and achieve its objectives. I argue that climate justice will be promoted through compensation for loss and damage. An international compensation fund offers a relatively simple and ethically satisfactory way of acknowledging the physical loss and psychological damage resulting from climate change and from the extensive violation of islanders' human rights.,"[Adelman, Sam] Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Adelman, S (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,,"Adelman, Sam/0000-0002-2896-6996",,,,103,17,17,2,13,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

We suggest that a legal stalemate has arisen at global level regarding environmental migrants. The second section examines the evolving negotiations to address environmental migrants in the Pacific region that are, in contrast to the global North, based on climate science and on calls for climate justice and solidarity. We conclude that the inclusion of post-colonial perspectives in the debates on environmental migration can render visible the political nature of climate adaptation choices and reconnect global negotiations to questions of fair burden sharing in adaptation. The article brings a legal anthropological lens to bear on empirical material from the Pacific region, to show the new rights, resources and policies that may emerge from climate change and migration debates. The article offers insights into the increasingly complex decision-making processes and development of policies and laws in the context of global climate change.","[Klepp, Silja; Herbeck, Johannes] Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Bremen, Germany","Klepp, S (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Bremen, Germany.",,,"Herbeck, Johannes/0000-0001-8108-9921; Klepp, Silja/0000-0001-9837-362X",,,,107,20,20,1,13,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

According to this view, historical high-emitters of greenhouse gases-or currently existing individuals that are appropriately related to them-are in possession of some form of emission debt, owed to certain of those who are now burdened by climate change. It is frequently claimed that such debts were originally incurred by historical emissions that violated a principle of fair shares for the world's natural resources. Thus, a suitable principle of natural resource justice is required to render this interpretation of historical accountability complete. I argue that the need for such a principle poses a significant challenge for the historical emission debt view, because there doesn't appear to be any determinate answer to the question what a fair share of climate sink capacity would have been historically. This leaves the historical emission debt view incomplete and thus unable to explain a powerful intuition that appears to motivate the view: namely, that there is something unjust about how the climate sink has historically been used. I suggest an alternative explanation of this common intuition according to which historically unequal consumption of climate sink capacity, whether or not wrongful in and of itself, is a symptom of broader global injustice concerning control over and access to the world's natural resources. This broader historical injustice will be harder to quantify and harder to repair than that which the historical emission debt purports to identify.","[Blomfield, Megan] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England","Blomfield, M (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",megan.blomfield@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,57,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1356-4765,1572-8692,,RES PUBLICA-NETH,Res Publica,MAR,2016,22,1,,,SI,,67,81,,10.1007/s11158-015-9312-z,,,15,Philosophy,Philosophy,FF2JZ,WOS:000408725000007,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-08-07,

While much of the normative literature on climate mitigation has focused on burden sharing within the context of reductions in emissions of greenhouse gas, I explore the question of how the costs of protecting tropical forests in order to harness their climate mitigation potential should be distributed amongst developing and developed states. In response to this question, I outline and defend a 'beneficiary pays' account of forestry mitigation burden sharing that requires affluent states to finance measures supporting avoided deforestation while less affluent states, within whose territory these forests tend to be located, implement these measures. The normative basis for this account, I argue, is a principle of 'unjust enrichment' according to which developed states must bear much of the cost of avoided deforestation for its climate mitigation potential because of the huge economic benefits their citizens have accumulated from productive activities that have contributed to climate change.","[Page, Ed] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Page, E (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",E.A.Page@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,27,7,7,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1356-4765,1572-8692,,RES PUBLICA-NETH,Res Publica,MAR,2016,22,1,,,SI,,83,97,,10.1007/s11158-015-9313-y,,,15,Philosophy,Philosophy,FF2JZ,WOS:000408725000008,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

Global carbon sink conservation raises a host of normative issues, though, since it is debatable who should pay the costs of carbon sink conservation, who has the duty to protect which sinks, and how far the duty to conserve one's carbon sinks actually extends, especially if it conflicts with other duties one might have. According to some, forested states like Ecuador have a duty to preserve their tropical forests while the rich states of the global North have a duty of fairness to compensate states like Ecuador for the costs they incur. My aim in this paper is to critically analyse this standard line of argument and to criticise its validity both internally (i.e. with regard to its normative conclusion based on its premises) and externally (i.e. with regard to the argument's underlying assumptions and its lack of contextualisation). As I will argue, the duty to conserve one's forests is only a particular instantiation of a wider, more general duty to contribute towards global climate justice for which the context in which one operates (e.g. whether other agents are complying with their duties of global climate justice or not) matters significantly.","[Schuppert, Fabian] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland","Schuppert, F (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",f.schuppert@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,24,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1356-4765,1572-8692,,RES PUBLICA-NETH,Res Publica,MAR,2016,22,1,,,SI,,99,116,,10.1007/s11158-015-9314-x,,,18,Philosophy,Philosophy,FF2JZ,WOS:000408725000009,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-08-07,

Both individually and collectively, in the form of adaptation and mitigation strategies, we are building our capacity to respond to the climate change, but the dimensions of environmental justice, equal treatment in the policy making and even the clear definition of vulnerable groups are often neglected. The climate justice is an evidence-based response to the environmental injustice and helpful in creation of fair policies and strategies to address the impacts of global warming by empowering the vulnerable groups with required legal resources, provision to ensuring necessary funding and capability to deal existing discrimination in the society. Historically, the journey of climate justice had begun with its recognition by the international bodies and legal frameworks. In the year 1992, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change insisted the member states to work together to reduce the greenhouse gases emission and also emphasized on the equity dimension of climate justice by mentioning the 'common but differentiated responsibility' in the charter. It specifies the need of proactive participation of the developed countries to resolve the issue of global warming, which was fueled by their ambitions, and they should help the developing countries with technological advances and finance to respond to climate change. The dimension of climate justice for the individuals and the vulnerable groups is to achieve a fair, equitable and sustainable legal solution to deal with the existing injustice in the society. It is a new kind of environmental movement, which is advocating for achieving a socially responsible, scientifically sound and economically fairly distributed legal framework. Climate justice offers a fair treatment and equal platform to deal with the inconsistencies in the recognition of different vulnerable groups and lack of opportunities for involving in decision-making system. The paper discusses the sustainable approach to respond to the climate injustice, where the vulnerable groups, disadvantaged individuals and the least developed states, who contributed least in global warming, but likely to be most affected by its impacts.

As a global issue, climate justice requires the recognition by rich countries of the adverse impact of climate change, especially in the Third World. Environmental pragmatism is an ethical paradigm that offers immediate, solid and action-oriented approach to environmental problems. From a practical end, the issue seems to demand that the theoretical debates on policy should now be resolved to hold governments and people accountable in order to address the problem. Is this the right thing to do? I argue that the pragmatic position on this matter is problematic. Environmental pragmatism suffers from ethical and democratic deficits. For instance, pragmatic solutions will not work in the Third World societies because of weak institutions and hegemonic power relations between the national leadership and the people. In this regard, one has to appeal to participatory democracy in the choice of ethical paradigms.

These IPCC recommendations aim to preserve a likely (>66%) chance of limiting global warming to 2 degrees C but are not necessarily consistent with the stronger ambition of the subsequent Paris Agreement of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'. The G7 did not specify global or national emissions scenarios consistent with its own agreement. Here we identify global cost-optimal emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models that match the G7 agreement. These scenarios have global 2030 emissions targets of 11%-43% below 2010, global net negative CO2 emissions starting between 2056 and 2080, and some exhibit net negative greenhouse gas emissions from 2080 onwards. We allocate emissions from these global scenarios to countries according to five equity approaches representative of the five equity categories presented in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (IPCCAR5): 'capability', 'equality', 'responsibility-capability-need', 'equal cumulative per capita' and 'staged approaches'. Our results show that G7 members' Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDCs) mitigation targets are in line with a grandfathering approach but lack ambition to meet various visions of climate justice. The INDCs of China and Russia fall short of meeting the requirements of any allocation approach. Depending on how their INDCs are evaluated, the INDCs of India and Brazil can match some equity approaches evaluated in this study.","[Robiou du Pont, Yann; Meinshausen, Malte] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Jeffery, M.

Drawing upon some fundamentals of the social work profession such as coalition building, advocacy engagement, and stakeholder outreach, this article shows how social workers can become engaged in the political arena to pass legislation. It is the author's hope that this article will be used by social workers and social workers in training to deepen their commitment to women's issues and social justice advocacy and facilitate their engagement in making policy change.","[Bird, Melissa] Univ So Calif, Sch Social Work, Montgomery Ross Fisher Bldg,669 West 34th St, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Bird, M (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Sch Social Work, Montgomery Ross Fisher Bldg,669 West 34th St, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",birdm@usc.edu,,,,,,9,3,3,2,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0886-1099,1552-3020,,AFFILIA J WOM SOC WO,Affil.

To date, discussions around climate justice within Scottish policy have largely focussed on international dimensions. Questions remain as to what climate justice means at home in Scotland. This article aims to engage with such questions. It begins with an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of climate justice discourses and discusses the various ways that climate justice is framed and understood. We then introduce a categorisation of three broad approaches to climate justice which are being seen globally: conceptual, pragmatic and transformative. We discuss how climate justice has been pursued in practice to illustrate the different forms that can occur under a climate justice banner, and the implications of different understandings of the concept. Using the human rights based approach to climate change as an illustration of the malleable nature of climate justice, we categorise and critique the dominant approach to climate justice used in Scotland. We find that climate justice is a label which can be applied to a range of practices, with differing results. It is hoped that this article encourages further reflection and debate on the particular flavour of climate justice which has been chosen in Scotland and its implications.","[Aitken, Mhairi] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ben Christman] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Law, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Bonaventura, Mike] Univ Glasgow, Crichton Carbon Ctr, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Bonaventura, Mike] Univ Glasgow, Sch Interdisciplinary Studies, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Bonaventura, Mike] ClimateXChange, Intranatl Climate Justice, London, England; [van der Horst, Dan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Energy Environm & Soc, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Holbrook, Julian] Climate Challenge Fund, Community Act Support Programme, London, England","Aitken, M (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,"Aitken, Mhairi/0000-0002-4654-9803",,,,80,4,4,1,12,EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS,EDINBURGH,"THE TUN-HOLYROOD RD, 12 2F JACKSONS ENTRY, EDINBURGH EH8 8PJ, SCOTLAND",0966-0356,2053-888X,,SCOTT AFF,Scott.

Two research questions drive the analysis: (1) how does recovery vary by acquisition funding source; and (2) what is the relationship between recovery and vulnerable populations? Through spatial econometric modeling, relative recovery is compared between two federal programs that funded the acquisitions, and across socially vulnerable populations. The results indicate both distributive and temporal inequalities in the allocation of federal recovery funds. In particular, Latino and elderly populations were associated with lower recovery rates.

According to government officials and industry leaders, the opening of energy reserves for private development will spur economic growth and establish the country as a leader in the energy arena. This article examines whether the reforms could also lead to community-led growth in the renewable energy sector, specifically in Oaxaca, Mexico, which has been identified as one of the windiest places in the world and is currently already the site of extensive wind energy development. Building on my prior work exploring the impact of renewable energy development on indigenous communities in Oaxaca, this article presents a framework to explore the aspects of the energy reform that could lead to greater participation in renewable energy development by communities who have historically disproportionately borne the brunt of the country's energy development in the country. This article utilizes the theory of energy justice, which incorporates principles of environmental justice and climate justice as well as energy democracy, to consider whether opening the Mexican energy market to private participation and increased competition in the electricity sector could render communities more resilient in the face of climate change and better able to meet their energy needs.","[Baker, Shalanda H.] Univ Hawaii, William S Richardson Sch Law, Energy Justice Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Baker, Shalanda H.] Univ Hawaii, William S Richardson Sch Law, Environm Law Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Baker, SH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, William S Richardson Sch Law, Energy Justice Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.; Baker, SH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, William S Richardson Sch Law, Environm Law Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,,,,,,77,23,23,0,12,"UNIV NEW MEXICO, SCH LAW",ALBUQUERQUE,"MSC11-6070, 1 UNIVERSITY NEW MEXICO, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA",0028-0739,,,NAT RESOUR J,Nat.

The study contributes to the growing body of literature that explores the impacts climate-induced changes are having on Indigenous peoples through its explicit focus on this distinctive social group. The paper entails a detail case study of the particular ways the recent onset of two consecutive extreme weather events have impacted livelihood activities in these traditional farming villages. Primary data were collected in the aftermath of a severe drought that was followed by Hurricane Tomas in 2010, using a mixed method approach involving a questionnaire survey of 311 households, 70 unstructured interviews and 2 focus group sessions held in each of the three communities. The combined impact of these extreme weather events not only brought to light how exposed and sensitive these communities are to climatic hazards, but also illustrated some of the underlying issues driving vulnerability at the local scale that must be dealt with if climate justice is to be achieved. We argue that the factors driving vulnerability within these communities are partly a function of centuries of economic neglect and political marginalization and are also strongly related to the communities' characteristically lower-socio economic status, geographic location, heavy reliance on land-based resources, coupled with a range of cognitive barriers that affect residents' capacity to adapt to a changing and variable regional climate regime.

Vulnerability studies of climate change effects on communities have often focused on differences between communities given these climate injustices. However, there is a need to also focus on vulnerability within communities, referred to here as comparative vulnerabilities. Climate justice therefore becomes even more important with more focused attention given to the nuances within groups that fall within the vulnerable category. This article examines comparative vulnerabilities for the fishing community in Jamaica. A survey of 241 fishers from Old Harbour Bay, the largest fishing village in Jamaica, was conducted to examine the level of vulnerability of different fishers to climate change. A vulnerability index was constructed for the community and then comparative vulnerabilities were determined based on socio-demographic characteristics. Overall for the sample 46.9% of respondents would be considered as experiencing a comparatively high level of vulnerability to climate change. Climate change vulnerability was influenced by a number of socio-demographic variables with unique profiles emerging for groups that can be ranked as low, moderate, and high vulnerability. The paper therefore argues that within vulnerable populations there are comparative vulnerabilities based on economic factors and social capital, which must be taken into consideration for adaptation strategies to be implemented. Given these comparative vulnerabilities a more targeted approach to coping and adaptation strategies can then be taken. This will assist in building resilience of these communities that must now adjust to a new normal with climate change effects currently occurring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is therefore an appropriate time to ask whether the frameworks that lie behind climate change discourse and policy are consistent with the demands of social and environmental justice. In this paper, we use climate justice as a lens for evaluating three prominent frameworks for addressing climate change, those of adaptation, resilience, and vulnerability. Each of these discursive frameworks, we argue, can contribute to our understanding of climate change, but they do not all incorporate justice concerns to the same degree. In order to illustrate this, we examine the justice implications of using each of the three frameworks to assess a case study of agricultural transformation in Southwestern Jamaica. Farmers in this region have adapted to changing climate conditions in a variety of ways, including the use of new agricultural technology. The ability of many farmers to take advantage of such innovations, however, is constrained by the underlying landscape of vulnerability within the region. After interpreting this example from the perspectives of adaptation, resilience and vulnerability, we conclude that all three paradigms are capable of calling attention to climate justice issues, but only in the vulnerability perspective are such issues intrinsic. We believe, therefore, that a greater attention to vulnerability within Caribbean climate policy holds the potential to advance the goals of climate justice within the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Peasant farmers and herders in the Peruvian headwaters are among the most vulnerable to global warming, since they are the first to experience the changes in water supplies. Leaders in the highlands claim rights connected to a fluid ownership of water that is born in their territory and demand payments from the companies making money on this water based on the principles of reciprocity and justice. These demands are attempts at taking control of an uncertain future and as such are examples of political agency relating to climate change.

The objective was to explore how two neighbouring communities and their governments respond to large-scale environmental change within connected but uneven political ecological contexts. Current climate change impacts in this bi-national island present an opportunity to better understand not only local climate justice but also how fragmented sovereignty, territoriality, and citizenship regimes may affect processes of climate adaptation. The researchers conducted 27 semi-structured interviews in the Dominican Republic and 11 in Haiti, with open ended questions. The data analysis explores impacts of the lakes' growth; perceived causes and solutions; access to assistance; views on responsibility; and capacities for mobilization, bi-national cooperation, and international partnerships. The article argues that different capabilities for climate adaptation are shaped by historical path dependencies, local institutional contexts, and international linkages; and that attaining climate justice requires attention to these factors within a collective normative framework. The conclusion examines how climate science, research partnerships, and citizen participation might be leveraged to help build binational adaptation strategies grounded in a capabilities approach to climate justice.

This paper addresses that limitation by examining whether Hispanic immigrants are disproportionately exposed to risks from flood hazards relative to other racial/ethnic groups (including US-born Hispanics), adjusting for relevant covariates. Survey data were collected for 1283 adult householders in the Houston and Miami Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and flood risk was estimated using their residential presence/absence within federally-designated 100-year flood zones. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with binary logistic specifications that adjust for county-level clustering were used to analyze (separately) and compare the Houston (N = 546) and Miami (N = 560) MSAs in order to clarify determinants of household exposure to flood risk. GEE results in Houston indicate that Hispanic immigrants have the greatest likelihood, and non-Hispanic Whites the least likelihood, of residing in a 100-year flood zone. Miami GEE results contrastingly reveal that non-Hispanic Whites have a significantly greater likelihood of residing in a flood zone when compared to Hispanic immigrants. These divergent results suggest that human-flood hazard relationships have been structured differently between the two MSAs, possibly due to the contrasting role that water-based amenities have played in urbanization within the two study areas. Future EJ research and practice should differentiate between Hispanic subgroups based on nativity status and attend to contextual factors influencing environmental risk disparities.","[Maldonado, Alejandra; Collins, Timothy W.; Grineski, Sara E.; Chakraborty, Jayajit] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Collins, TW (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",amaldonado7@miners.utep.edu; twcollins@utep.edu; segrineski@utep.edu; jchakraborty@utep.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1129984, CMMI-1536113]; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1536113] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact InnNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1129984] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank Marilyn Montgomery for her assistance with data preparation.

Critical theorization of the concept is in its nascent phase and the notion itself has received relatively little attention in the United States. Our paper aims to address these lacunae by mobilizing an urban political ecology framework to consider a community-based campaign that targeted residential energy conservation funds in Buffalo, New York. We analyze how the community campaign drew upon the network crisis of the energy-poor home to frame critical justice demands that foregrounded energy poverty as the product of uneven socionatural development. Through spatial claims and scalar strategies, the campaign highlighted the contribution of neoliberal conservation programs to deepening patterns of uneven development, and demanded redress of disinvestment in urban housing stock through funding of weatherization for low-income households. We argue that contests over urban energy metabolism offer a fruitful area to explore the possibilities of transforming uneven development from below. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We point out that energy poverty affects millions of families in Mexico, so there is a need for overcoming this social justice problem. Hence, this paper presents a methodological framework to characterize families according to their levels of deprivation of energy services and, furthermore, identify the determining factors of these different levels of deprivation. Our results indicate that five groups of homes exist: one which does not lack any energy service; two which lack only one energy service; and two which lack the majority of energy services. Those variables which most precisely explain the probability that a home be found in each of these groups are per-capita income, size of settlement (urban or rural), and type of climate. We conclude our findings have public policy implications in that, upon characterizing households based on their level of deprivation of energy services, sound strategies may be designed and implemented to attend to the specific needs of each household group.

However, there has been relatively little examination of exactly which energy uses should be considered basic necessities within a given cultural context and so of concern for energy justice. We examine the inclusion of energy-using necessities within the outcomes of deliberative workshops within members of the public focused on defining a minimum-standard of living in the UK and repeated biannually over a six year period. Our secondary analysis shows that energy uses deemed to be necessities are diverse and plural, enabling access to multiple valued energy services, and that their profile has to some degree shifted from 2008 to 2014. The reasoning involved is multidimensional, ranging across questions of health, social participation, opportunity and practicality. We argue that public deliberations about necessities can be taken as legitimate grounding for defining minimum standards and therefore the scope of 'doing justice' in fuel poverty policy. However we set this in tension with how change over time reveals the escalation of norms of energy dependency in a society that on climate justice grounds must radically reduce carbon emissions.

The magnitude and pattern of changes in weather and climate variables are creating differential exposures, vulnerabilities, and health risks that increase stress on health systems while exacerbating existing and creating new health inequities. Examples from national and local health adaptation projects highlight that developing partnerships across sectors and levels are critical for building climate-resilient health systems and communities. Strengthening current and implementing new health interventions, such as using environmental information to develop early warning systems, can be effective in protecting the most vulnerable. However, not all projected risks of climate change can be avoided by climate policies and programs, so health system strengthening is also critical. Applying a health inequity lens can reduce current vulnerabilities while building resilience to longer-term climate change. Taking inequities into account is critical if societies are to effectively prepare for and manage the challenges ahead.","[Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fawcett, Stephen B.] Univ Kansas, WHO, Ctr Work Grp Community Hlth & Dev, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Spiegel, Jerry] Univ British Columbia, Global Hlth Res Program, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Tovalin, Horacio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Occupat Hlth Grad Program, FES Zaragoza, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Ebi, KL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",krisebi@uw.edu,,"TOVALIN, HORACIO/0000-0003-4419-9392",World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline,,,21,1,1,0,5,PAN AMER HEALTH ORGANIZATION,WASHINGTON,"525 23RD ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037 USA",1020-4989,,,REV PANAM SALUD PUBL,Rev.

Yet, a number of questions arise when one contemplates how international human rights law might accommodate the rights of persons as yet unborn. Among them are the theoretical questions of whether it is possible for future generations to possess human rights and for present generations to owe them corresponding duties. Assuming that such a theoretical conceptualisation is possible, a number of legal issues are present in attempting to protect the rights offuture generations within current international human rights law, including the question of how the rights of future generations can be balanced against those of current generations. The paper will examine a number of domestic measures designed to protect the rights of future generations and consider how such mechanisms might contribute to a rights-based approach to resolving intergenerational climate injustice.","[Lewis, Bridget] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Lewis, B (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",,"Lewis, Bridget/J-1114-2012","Lewis, Bridget/0000-0002-1940-5548",,,,77,5,5,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0924-0519,2214-7357,,NETH Q HUM RIGHTS,Neth.

In this letter we examine thermal inequity associated with climate change impacts and changes to urban form in a comparatively socio-economically disadvantaged Australian suburb. Local urban densification policies designed to counteract sprawl have reduced block sizes, increased height limits, and diminished urban tree canopy cover (UTC). Little attention has been given to the combined effects of lower UTC and increased heat on disadvantaged residents. Such impacts include rising energy expenditure to maintain thermal comfort (i.e. cooling dwellings). We used a survey of residents (n = 230) to determine their perceptions of climate change impacts; household energy costs; household thermal comfort practices; and dispositions towards using green infrastructure to combat heat. Results suggest that while comparatively disadvantaged residents spend more on energy as a proportion of their income, they appear to have reduced capacity to adapt to climate change at the household scale. We found most residents favoured more urban greening and supported tree planting in local parks and streets. Findings have implications for policy responses aimed at achieving urban climate justice.","[Byrne, Jason] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Byrne, Jason] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Ambrey, Christopher; Matthews, Tony] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Ctr, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia; [Portanger, Chloe] Informat Analyt Specialist Climate Planning, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Lo, Alex] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Baker, Douglas] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Davison, Aidan] Univ Tasmania, Discipline Geog & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Byrne, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.; Byrne, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.",jason.byrne@griffith.edu.au; c.ambrey@griffith.edu.au; chloe@climateplanning.com.au; alexloyh@hku.hk; t.matthews@griffith.edu.au; d2.baker@qut.edu.au; aidan.davison@utas.edu.au,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008; Byrne, Jason/AAC-6344-2019; Baker, Douglas C/J-1007-2012; Davison, Aidan GM/N-3863-2013; Byrne, Jason A/L-7140-2013","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176; Baker, Douglas C/0000-0001-8812-8567; Davison, Aidan GM/0000-0002-5618-7068; Byrne, Jason A/0000-0001-8733-0333; Matthews, Tony/0000-0003-0838-5462",City of Gold Coast Council,We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the City of Gold Coast Council in funding survey printing and mailing.

Traditional drainage approaches using grey infrastructure offer low adaptation to an uncertain future. New methodologies of stormwater management focus on decentralized approaches in a long-term planning framework, including the use of Green Infrastructure (GI). This work presents a novel methodology to select, evaluate, and place different green-grey practices (or measures) for retrofitting urban drainage systems. The methodology uses a hydrodynamic model and multi-objective optimization to design solutions at a watershed level. The method proposed in this study was applied in a highly urbanized watershed to evaluate the effect of these measures on Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) quantity. This approach produced promising results and may become a useful tool for planning and decision making of drainage systems.","[Alves, Alida; Sanchez, Arlex; Vojinovic, Zoran; Brdjanovic, Damir] UNESCO IHE, Environm Engn & Water Technol Dept, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Seyoum, Solomon] UNESCO IHE, Hydroinformat & Knowledge Management Dept, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Babel, Mukand] AIT Asian Inst Technol, Sch Engn & Technol, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand","Alves, A (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE, Environm Engn & Water Technol Dept, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands.",a.alves@unesco-ihe.org; a.sanchez@unesco-ihe.org; z.vojinovic@unesco-ihe.org; sol_d1972@yahoo.com; msbabel@ait.asia; d.brdjanovic@unesco-ihe.org,,"Sanchez Torres, Arlex/0000-0003-3146-2841",Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program; Advanced Class Program at UNESCO-IHE by UNEP-DHI Partnership-Center on Water and Environment; Municipality of Montevideo,This research was funded by the Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program and by the Advanced Class Program at UNESCO-IHE financed by UNEP-DHI Partnership-Center on Water and Environment.

Burdened low-income communities and people of color could experience health benefits from reductions in air and water pollution, yet these same groups could suffer harm if transitions lack broad public input or if policies prioritize elite or corporate interests. This paper highlights how U.S. energy transitions build from, and contribute to, environmental injustices. Energy justice requires not only ending disproportionate harm, it also entails involvement in the design of solutions and fair distribution of benefits, such as green jobs and clean air. To what extent does the confluence of state, civic, and market processes assure just transitions to clean, low-carbon energy production involving equitable distribution of costs, benefits, and decision-making power? To explore this question we assess trends with (1) fossil fuel divestment; (2) carbon taxes and social cost of carbon measurements; (3) cap-and-trade; (4) renewable energy; and (5) energy efficiency. Current research demonstrates opportunities and pitfalls in each area with mixed or partial energy justice consequences, leading to our call for greater attention to the specifics of distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice in research, policy, and action. Illustrative energy transition case studies suggest the feasibility and benefit of empowering approaches, but also indicate there can be conflict between green and just, as evident though stark inequities in clean energy initiatives. To identify positive pathways forward, we compile priorities for an energy justice research agenda based on interactive and participatory practices aligning advocacy, activism, and academics.","[Finley-Brook, Mary] Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Holloman, Erica L.] Southeast CARE Coalit, Newport News, VA 23607 USA","Finley-Brook, M (corresponding author), Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",mbrook@richmond.edu; holloman.e.l@gmail.com,,"Finley-Brook, Mary/0000-0001-6416-3560",University of Richmond; Bonner Center for Civic Engagement,"Mary Finley-Brook appreciates travel funding from the University of Richmond, support from the Bonner Center for Civic Engagement, and insights from Zoltan Grossman, Abigail Martin, Noel Healy, Curt Gurvich, Valerie Rountree, Reverend Lennox Yearwood, Jr., and Munro Brook.

I start from a position of considerable sympathy with their appreciation of the discursive dimensions of power that attach to the idiom of development and their solidarity with the oppositional projects of subaltern groups. However, this sympathy combines with a considerable degree of disagreement in terms of how the discursive power of development is understood and how the dynamics of popular resistance are theorised. As an alternative to the relatively crude postulation of development as a discursive regime that enables the West to exercise power over the Rest, I develop an argument that emphasises the multivalent character of the idiom of development and trace this multivalence to situated contestations that take place between opposing political projects that strive to shape the form and direction of social change in specific ways. Furthermore, I will argue that this contentious dynamic becomes particularly evident in those world-historical conjunctures when subaltern groups mobilize around social movement projects that destabilise hegemonic power relations in the capitalist world-system. To illustrate this point, I will provide a broad-brushed outline of three distinct 'development regimes' that have shaped North-South relations from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first century and discuss the ways in which these regimes have been destabilised by the articulation of oppositional meanings of development articulated from below by progressive social movement projects. Finally, I draw on my own fieldwork experiences to reflect on how critical scholars can engage with movement projects that challenge the dominant directions and meanings of development in ways that can contribute to democratic deliberations within social movements.","[Nilsen, Alf Gunvald] Univ Bergen, Dept Sociol, Bergen, Norway; [Nilsen, Alf Gunvald] Univ Witwatersrand, Soc Work & Dev Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa","Nilsen, AG (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Sociol, Bergen, Norway.; Nilsen, AG (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Soc Work & Dev Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa.",alfgunvald@gmail.com,,,,,,139,9,9,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0891-4486,1573-3416,,INT J POLITICS CULT,Int.

These communities' long-term vulnerability may increase as a result of the interaction of sea-level rise and legacy pollution. This article presents research on experience and perceptions of sea-level rise, flooding, legacy pollution/contamination, and health in an EJ community in northern Delaware. The community is in close proximity to documented brownfields and other hazardous sites, and is located where there are long-term projections of water inundation due to sea-level rise. Researchers administered quantitative surveys at local events that measured knowledge and concern for these issues; conducted focus groups that enabled a deeper understanding of survey results; and examined community perceptions relative to existing policy tools, including sea-level rise inundation maps and documentation of contaminated sites. The mixed-method approach created a baseline of perceptions on pollution, flooding, a health-environment connection, and sea-level rise. Key findings include the value of experiential knowledge of local flooding to improve efficacy of future policy prescriptions, and how a lack of knowledge of sea-level rise, coupled with great concern for it, might be explained by longtime familiarity with flooding issues in the community.","[Perez, Victor W.] Univ Delaware, Dept Sociol & Criminal Justice, 329 Smith Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Egan, Jennifer] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Water Sci & Policy Program, 213 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Perez, VW (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Sociol & Criminal Justice, 329 Smith Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",victorp@udel.edu,,,National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant [IIA-1301765]; state of Delaware; Office Of The DirectorNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1301765] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"The authors wish to thank Robyn Mello, David Carter, Donald Sparks, Joshua LeMonte, Kent Messer, Lindsey Craig, Melisa Soysal, Clare Sevcik, the Southbridge Civic Association, the South Wilmington Planning Network, and the Southbridge Weekend Committee.

But what facilitates individual adaptive behavior? How does the performance of government intervention affect such behavior? Drawing on political economy, environmental psychology, and climate justice perspectives, we explore how perceived fairness of responses to weather-related extreme events affects the public and private distribution of responsibility and action. We focus on flood risk and examine how perceptions of fairness of response by residents in flood-affected areas, along with their prior experience of flooding and perceptions of scope of government responsibility and capacity, affect willingness to take individual adaptive action. We use data from surveys of 356 households affected by a flood event in November 2009 in Cumbria, UK, and Galway, Ireland, to compare perceptions of fairness of responses and private intentions across two political jurisdictions. We find that aspects of fairness are related to willingness to take adaptive action but vary with context, experience, and knowledge of flooding. In Cumbria, where there is greater experience of flooding, willingness to act correlates with procedural justice, risk knowledge, and capacity. Capacity for flood management in Galway is firmly associated with state agencies, whereas in Cumbria it is perceived to result from responsibilities of public and private action. These findings highlight the central role of government action and its perceived fairness in structuring private responses to environmental risks and point to the crucial role of climate justice perspectives in navigating adaptation.","[Adger, W.

We present a four-metric framework to identify priority regions to deploy and dispatch these technologies to displace marginal grid air emissions with high environmental and health impacts. To the standard metrics of total mass and rate of air pollutant emissions we add location and time, to prioritize emission displacement near densely populated areas with poor air quality, especially at times when air pollutant concentrations exceed regulatory standards. We illustrate our framework with a case study using storage, demand response, and other technologies to displace peaker power plants, the highest-rate marginal emitters on the California grid. We combine spatial-temporal data on plant electricity generation, air quality standard exceedance days, and population characteristics available from environmental justice screening tool CalEnviroScreen 2.0 to determine where emissions reductions may have the greatest marginal benefit. This screening approach can inform grid siting decisions, such as storage in lieu of peaker plants in high impact regions, or dispatch protocol, such as triggering demand response instead of pealcer plants on poor air quality days.

These are the use of non-legal perspectives from the social sciences for improving environmental law scholarship, further enquiry into risk concepts, and the incorporation of social justice considerations into environmental market-based approaches.","[Le Gal, Elodie] Univ New England, Australian Ctr Agr & Law, Armidale, NSW, Australia","Le Gal, E (corresponding author), Univ New England, Australian Ctr Agr & Law, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,,89,2,2,0,0,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1385-2140,1875-8258,,ASIA PAC J ENVIRON,Asia Pac.

It has become necessary to build nonideal approaches. We propose to give serious consideration to the problem of motivation to act by putting forward some prudential reasons for tackling climate change-with the aim not of replacing existing but inadequate moral motivations, but of strengthening them. First, we identify three major ideal approaches that have so far prevailed in climate justice research, grounded respectively on deontological ethics, on virtue ethics, and on utilitarianism. We highlight their practical limitations, particularly with regards to the problem of motivation to act. Second, we open the way for an alternative nonideal approach to climate justice based on amoral motivations issuing from a careful examination of global systemic disruptions as well as of specific national and local situations. This approach cannot be ignored if one wishes to motivate nation-states, corporations, and individuals to act. However, our goal is not to replace ideal theory with nonideal theory, but rather to complete the former with the latter for a more comprehensive account of climate justice that distinguishes the problem of moral justification from the problem of motivation.","[Andre, Pierre] Univ Paris Sorbonne Paris IV, Philosophie, Paris, France; [Bourban, Michel] Univ Lausanne, Inst Geog & Durabilite, Rech, Lausanne, Switzerland","Andre, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sorbonne Paris IV, Philosophie, Paris, France.",,,,,,,54,0,0,0,1,"UNIV MONTREAL, FAC ARTS & SCIENCES",MONTREAL,"SUCC CENTRE VILLE, C P 6128, MONTREAL, QC H3C 3J7, CANADA",1718-9977,,,ATELIERS ETHIQUE,Ateliers Ethique,FAL,2016,11,2-3,,,,,4,27,,,,,24,Ethics,Social Sciences - Other Topics,VB8OJ,WOS:000419287300001,,,,,2021-08-07,

However, attributing direct human health effects to climate change adaptation is difficult, causing an ethical dilemma between the need for evidence of strategies and their precautionary implementation before such evidence has been generated. In the absence of conclusive evidence for individual adaptation strategies, alternative approaches to the measurement of adaptation effectiveness need to be developed. This article proposes a theoretical framework and a set of guiding questions to assess effects of adaptation strategies on seven domains of health determinants, including social, economic, infrastructure, institutional, community, environmental, and cultural determinants of health. Its focus on advancing gender equity and environmental justice concurrently with the implementation of health-related adaptation could serve as a template for policymakers and researchers.","[Boeckmann, Melanie] Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Zeeb, Hajo] Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol BIPS, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, Achterstr 39, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Zeeb, Hajo] Univ Bremen, Hlth Sci Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Boeckmann, Melanie] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Fac Med, Ctr Addict Res & Clin Epidemiol, Inst Gen Practice, POB 101007, D-40001 Dusseldorf, Germany","Boeckmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.; Boeckmann, M (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Fac Med, Ctr Addict Res & Clin Epidemiol, Inst Gen Practice, POB 101007, D-40001 Dusseldorf, Germany.",boeckmannmelanie@gmail.com; zeeb@leibniz-bips.de,"Zeeb, Hajo/I-2701-2019","Zeeb, Hajo/0000-0001-7509-242X; Boeckmann, Melanie/0000-0001-5909-5508",,,,81,6,6,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2227-9032,,,HEALTHCARE-BASEL,Healthcare,SEP,2016,4,3,,,,,,,65,10.3390/healthcare4030065,,,14,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Health Care Sciences & Services,VE4YP,WOS:000439450200031,27618121,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-08-07,

To avoid further disruptions, Brazil will need to take bold steps to eliminate both illegal and legal Amazon deforestation over the short term. Amazon deforestation declined by 70% between 2005 and 2014 due to drops in commodity prices and interventions by federal and state governments, such as law enforcement campaigns and credit restrictions for landowners who deforest illegally. Despite these impressive achievements, Brazil still deforests 5,000 km(2) of Amazonian forests each year. How then will Brazil eliminate Amazon deforestation altogether if the country is only committed to cut illegal deforestation by 2030-as stated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (iNDC) to the 2015 climate change treaty meeting in Paris? Here we provide an analysis of the major socio-economic-political threats that could constrain Brazil from achieving its current goals. We then propose six fundamental strategies to help Brazil achieve a more ambitious goal to eliminate all major legal and illegal Amazon deforestation. These strategies involve bringing social and environmental safeguards to the infrastructure plans in the region, consolidating and expanding positive incentives for the production of sustainable commodities, establishing a new policy to guarantee the social and environmental sustainability of rural settlements, fully implementing the national legislation protecting forests (the Forest Code), protecting the land rights of indigenous people and traditional communities, and expanding the existing network of protected areas, allocating the 80 million hectares of not designated public forests as protected areas or areas for sustainable use of timber and non-timber forest products. The implementation of these strategies however depends on the formulation of a new development paradigm that promotes economic growth, social justice and productive agriculture, while protecting the fundamentally important ecological services of tropical forests.","[Moutinho, Paulo; Guerra, Raissa] Amazon Environm Res Inst IPAM, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Moutinho, Paulo] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Azevedo-Ramos, Claudia] Fed Univ Para, NAEA, Ctr Higher Amazon Studies, Belem, Para, Brazil","Moutinho, P (corresponding author), Amazon Environm Res Inst IPAM, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.; Moutinho, P (corresponding author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA.",moutinho@ipam.org.br,,,,,,72,42,44,2,31,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2325-1026,,,ELEMENTA-SCI ANTHROP,Elementa-Sci.

India is the third largest coal producer in the world; it is projected to be the largest coal consumer by 2050. In the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India, over 450 hydroelectric power schemes are proposed or are under development. Hydropower projects ranging from micro hydro (run-of-the-river systems with generating capacity up to 100 kW) to large reservoirs (storage systems up to 2000 MW) such as the Tehri Dam are in various stages of planning, construction or implementation. Run-of-the-river hydropower projects are being developed in Uttarakhand in order to avoid some of the costs to local communities created by large dams. Stakeholders in this rapid hydropower expansion include multiple actors with often diverging sets of interests. The resulting governance challenges are centered on tradeoffs between local electricity and revenue from the sale of hydropower, on the one hand, and the impacts on small-scale irrigation systems, riparian-corridor ecosystem services, and other natural resource-based livelihoods, on the other. We focus on the Bhilangana river basin, where water dependent livelihoods differentiated by gender include farming, fishing, livestock rearing and fodder collection. We examine the contradictions inherent in hydropower governance based on the interests of local residents and other stakeholders including hydropower developers, urban and other regional electricity users, and state-level policymakers. We use a social justice approach applied to hydropower projects to examine some of the negative impacts, especially by location and gender, of these projects on local communities and then identify strategies that can safeguard or enhance livelihoods of women, youth, and men in areas with hydropower projects, while also maintaining critical ecosystem services. By assessing the Bhilangana basin case, we also offer hydropower-livelihoods-irrigation nexus lessons for headwater regions across the Himalayas and globally.","[Buechler, Stephanie; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Buechler, Stephanie; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Sen, Debashish; Khandekar, Neha] Peoples Sci Inst, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Khandekar, Neha] Energy & Resources Inst TERI, Delhi 110003, India","Buechler, S (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Buechler, S (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",buechler@email.arizona.edu; debu_manu@yahoo.co.in; khandekar05@gmail.com; cascott@email.arizona.edu,,,"International Water Management Institute; Water, Land, and Ecosystems Program of the CGIAR","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Water, Land, and Ecosystems Program of the CGIAR, and specifically funding for the project The Irrigation-Hydropower Nexus in the Ganges Headwaters provided by the International Water Management Institute.",,59,13,13,2,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2016,8,10,,,,,,,437,10.3390/w8100437,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,EE5PD,WOS:000389659200022,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-08-07,

Our work addresses such cost allocation problems by applying two different theoretical approaches: social justice and cooperative game theory in a real case study. First of all, a cost-effective portfolio of adaptation measures at the basin scale is selected using a least-cost optimization model. Cost allocation solutions are then defined based on economic rationality concepts from cooperative game theory (the Core). Second, interviews are conducted to characterize stakeholders' perceptions of social justice principles associated with the definition of alternatives cost allocation rules. The comparison of the cost allocation scenarios leads to contrasted insights in order to inform the decision-making process at the river basin scale and potentially reap the efficiency gains from cooperation in the design of river basin adaptation portfolios.","[Girard, Corentin; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia, Spain; [Rinaudo, Jean-Daniel] French Geol Survey, BRGM, Montpellier, France","Girard, C (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia, Spain.",cogimar@upv.es,"Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel/N-1619-2014; Rinaudo, Jean-Daniel/AAI-1193-2021","Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel/0000-0001-7009-6130; RINAUDO, Jean-Daniel/0000-0001-8539-574X","IMPADAPT project from the Spanish ministry MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) [CGL2013-48424-C2-1-R]; European FEDER fundsEuropean Commission; University Lecturer Training Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain [FPU12/03803]; BRGM's research program (environmental and risk economics) [30]","The study has been partially supported by the IMPADAPT project (CGL2013-48424-C2-1-R) from the Spanish ministry MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) with European FEDER funds.

This study aims to assess the cohesion of these frameworks in practice. To do this, we parse individuals' theories of change, or how they identify and propose to resolve environmental injustices in the pursuit of sustainability. We posit that these theories of change are comprised of three main components: (1) perceived environmental benefits and burdens; (2) the causal pathways of environmental and social injustice; and (3) visions for positive change. Drawing from 35 stakeholder interviews in Milwaukee (WI, USA) we examine individual and institutional perspectives on environmental and social change and their links to the production of injustice. Our findings reveal that participants do not distinguish between environmental and social injustices. Instead, both social and environmental factors are implicated in injustice. Furthermore, we identify two mental maps for how social and economic change reproduce injustice. These findings suggest the need to reorient how urban injustice is considered and make efforts to acknowledge how a diversity of operational theories of change could either be divisive or could bring environmental justice and sustainability initiatives together.","[Hornik, Kaitlyn] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cutts, Bethany] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, 2820 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Greenlee, Andrew] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 611 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Hornik, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hornik2@illinois.edu; bbcutts@ncsu.edu; agreen4@illinois.edu,"Cutts, Bethany/L-2757-2019","Cutts, Bethany/0000-0001-7879-526X; Greenlee, Andrew/0000-0002-2790-673X",Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant [NA14OAR4170095]; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Graduate College Focal Point Initiative Urban Environmental Equity,"We gratefully acknowledge funding from Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant, grant no.

This article addresses critically the issue of climate debt and climate injustice, forged over more than twenty years of international climate negotiations. Our goal is to show that climate change is a scientific or environmental issue but also, fundamentally, a social issue. The article will describe how, in view of the lack of agreements, civil societies have become increasingly involved in the climate debate through the adoption of innovative solutions. The Urgenda case in the Netherlands and the cases brought to court by the organization Our Children Trust, in the United States, are telling illustrations. The Paris Agreement sets out to counteract the geopolitics of the disrespect for sovereignty over natural resources. Therefore, the study of movements for climate justice provides a different perspective of climate negotiations, based, finally, on human rights, dignity and equality. The change in Paris portends some hope in achieving climate justice.","[Borras, Susana] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Derecho Int Publ & Relac Int, Tarragona, Spain","Borras, S (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Derecho Int Publ & Relac Int, Tarragona, Spain.",susana.borras@urv.cat,"Borras, Susana/E-5057-2016","Borras, Susana/0000-0002-8264-1252",,,,37,1,1,0,13,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,MADRID,"UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, MADRID, 00000, SPAIN",1699-3950,,,RELAC INT-MADR,Relac.

When nations and urban districts publicize their low GHG emissions, these emissions are often based on a production perspective including only emissions occurring within their geographical boundary. If instead a consumption perspective is applied then all emissions attributable to the inhabitants consumption patterns, no matter where they occur, are included, e.g. from imported goods and air travel. This provides new outlooks on sustainability, from this perspective Swedish emissions have increased rather than decreased in the last decades. Swedish researchers and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency propose that the production perspective should be complemented with a consumption perspective to describe more fairly who is responsible for what emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a consumption perspective on GHG emissions has gained ground in Sweden, specifically in the new Strategic Climate Program of the City of Gothenburg, discussing what municipal strategies and environmental discourses this perspective enhances. Applying actor network theory, we found three common features of importance for Sweden, and the City of Gothenburg, supporting the consumption perspective to gain ground. One is the existence of long-term environmental goals that facilitate this perspective. The other features are the existence of civil servants as drivers and the use of calculations from legitimate fact builders. We conclude that a consumption perspective strengthens the environmental justice discourse (as it claims to be a more just way of calculating global and local environmental effects) while possibly also increasing an individualized environmental discourse (as many municipal strategies aim to inform and influence the public to make lifestyle changes on their own). We argue that a consumption perspective is necessary in order to fully address environmental problems and to highlight issues of justice and responsibility. At the same time, this kind of eco-governmentality might lead to individualized self-governed climate subjects with outlooks that are too limited to foster change of dominant everyday practices.

The work demonstrates that despite the rise of neo-conservatism and self-interested power politics, questions of global distributive justice remain a central aspect of the international politics of climate change. However, while it is relatively easy to demonstrate that international climate politics is not beyond the reach of moral contestations, the assessment of exactly how much impact justice has on climate policies and the broader normative structures of the climate governance regime remains a very difficult task. As the world digests the Paris Agreement, it is vital that the current state of justice issues within the international climate change regime is comprehensively understood by scholars of climate justice and by academics and practitioners, not least because how these intractable issues of justice are dealt with (or not) will be a crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of the emerging climate regime.

However, it is often argued that maintaining economic growth conflicts with keeping human activities adjusted to ecological boundaries and finite resources, at least for the more-developed countries. With this paper, we present sustainability goals for building and planning in Sweden to be achieved by 2050 in a context of limited or even negative economic growth. These goals should ensure that all groups in society have sufficient resources and a good life within planetary boundaries. We select four goals in a participatory process: two environmental goals related to climate change and land use and two social goals related to welfare and participation. Our results show that achieving the environmental goals will require significant reductions of Sweden's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use compared to today's levels. Regarding the social goals, these are, in many aspects, reasonably well fulfilled in Sweden today, although disparities remain between groups of citizens. The main challenge, however, is to ensure that these goals are fulfilled even within environmental limits and if economic growth should halt.","[Faure, Eleonore; Svenfelt, Asa; Finnveden, Goran] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Environm Strategies Res, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hornborg, Alf] Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Human Geog, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hornborg, Alf] Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Human Ecol Div, S-22100 Lund, Sweden","Faure, E (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Environm Strategies Res, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",eef@kth.se; asa.svenfelt@abe.kth.se; goran.finnveden@abe.kth.se; alf.hornborg@hek.lu.se,,"Faure, Eleonore/0000-0003-4389-8984",FormasSwedish Research Council Formas,"Financial support from Formas is gratefully acknowledged.

In the same way, governing bodies and vested economic interests stake out opposing public positions. In the wake of the crucial international climate negotiations in Paris, December 2015, at which the nations adopted the first truly universal climate treaty, we look back over five years of participatory ethnographic research inside the UN climate talks and the social movements for climate justice, identifying key lifeworld assumptions inscribed in the public position-taking of central economic, public, and political sphere actors. Our findings include grounds for skepticism that UN climate policy can transcend the power of the fossil fuel companies to attenuate both international ambitions and national contributions to the universal effort, but also an exciting possibility that climate justice philosophy and tactics, aided by bold counter-spectacle techniques from the Occupy movement, might return to the stage in the coming years and lead the necessary deep culture shift that decarbonization will require.","[Widick, Richard] IICAT, 324 Carrillo St,Cottage D, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Foran, John] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Widick, R (corresponding author), IICAT, 324 Carrillo St,Cottage D, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",richard.widick@orfaleacenter.ucsb.edu; foran@soc.ucsb.edu,,,,,,55,1,1,0,10,BERGHAHN JOURNALS,BROOKLYN,"20 JAY ST, SUITE 512, BROOKLYN, NY 11201 USA",1558-6073,1558-5468,,NAT CULT,Nat.

Equally important yet receiving less attention is the need to support adaptation of the most vulnerable communities to the increasingly severe impacts of climatic changes. The Paris Agreement, negotiated at the 21st COP in December 2015, 'stitches up' national contributions on adaptation and mitigation into a global agreement. This article first reviews the adaptation components of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by developed, emerging and least developed nations. Second, we examine how adaptation and the related themes of loss and damage have been dealt with in the Paris Agreement in terms of: global goal, legal form, review mechanisms and financing arrangements. Finally, we look at the possibility of evolving new arrangements and opportunities for strengthening global response to adaptation by drawing on references to human rights and climate justice in the Paris Agreement. We contend that the global response cannot be relegated to action by individual nations-partly and loosely supported by global financial and technological flows. The Paris Agreement has made significant steps in raising the importance of adaptation vis-a-vis mitigation in climate action but a lot of work remains to be done. In a sense, the top-down elements of adaptation action reflect long held negotiating positions and the skepticism of developed nations with respect to adaptation. For the post-Paris climate regime to be legitimate and earn the trust of developing nations, it must focus equally on adaptation and mitigation and address the special needs of vulnerable communities across the world.","[Mathur, Vikrom] Observer Res Fdn, New Delhi, India; [Mohan, Aniruddh] Tandem Res, Candolim, Goa, India","Mohan, A (corresponding author), First Floor,D 342, New Delhi 110024, India.",ani.mohan11@hotmail.com,"Mohan, Aniruddh/G-5496-2018","Mohan, Aniruddh/0000-0002-6797-6329",,,,26,4,4,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0974-9284,0975-2684,,INDIA Q,India Q.,DEC,2016,72,4,,,,,330,342,,10.1177/0974928416672021,,,13,International Relations,International Relations,EG3ME,WOS:000390947900003,,,,,2021-08-07,
J,"Greffrath, W",,,,"Greffrath, Wynand",,,Radical post-colonialism and universities in South Africa,TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,,,Afrikaans,Article,,,,,,#FeesMustFall; Post-apartheid; Post-colonialism; radical politics; student protest; South African universities,,"This article concerns the wave of student protests that swept across South African universities during 2015 and 2016. The phenomenon of student protest at universities is approached and analysed against the backdrop of several macro political trends that are currently emerging in the South African context. It is argued that the most pronounced of these emergent trends is the radicalisation of South African politics and society. Widespread dissatisfaction with service delivery and the rendering of public goods by government have intensified calls for quicker and more radical political solutions to perceived socio-economic hardships. In this regard, the culture of service delivery protest stands out as a significant barometer of social dissatisfaction, despite the strides that have been made since 1994 in the improvement of basic quality of life in South Africa. Furthermore, and related to the aforementioned trend of radicalisation, there has occurred a clear burgeoning of the political left in South African politics. As social dissatisfaction has escalated over the last three to four years, new progressive and radical political actors have emerged in the landscape of institutionalised politics in order to capitalise on the prevalent alienation among citizens. Concurrently, established political parties have also adopted more progressive, and in some cases radical, policy and ideological positions. Together, these developments point towards a political playing field that is shifting to the left, as it were. Furthermore, the aforementioned developments have taken place during an epochal change in the South African psyche, namely the expiration of the period known as post-apartheid. The guiding values of tolerance, reconciliation and rainbow nationalism that characterised the post-apartheid period and political engagement are now conspicuously absent in South African politics. Instead, racial and economic class tensions have re-emerged and the political climate has become more confrontational and militant. Whereas the post-apartheid period was premised on forgiving the transgressions of apartheid and adopting a prospective orientation of future consolidation, South African society is now engaged in a retrospective re-interrogation of its colonialist past. Because of the confluence of these trends and circumstances, this article argues that it is possible to speak of the emergence of a post-colonial epoch in South Africa's historical trajectory. The notion of post-colonial South Africa is premised on numerous aspects which exist in a dialectical relationship with the history of the state and society. Among the most significant manifestations of this dialectic is the manner in which the post-colonial society engages critically with its institutions in an attempt to change and transform. Thus, as universities have become increasingly subject to such critical engagement by society, but spegfically by students, instability and conflict have arisen in the process of change and transformation. Various possible outcomes of such instability and change are considered in the article as universities, and formerly Afrikaans universities in particular, are faced with the challenges of responding to the demands of post-colonial politics and society. These demands include that universities become activist institutions that promote social justice, Africanisation and indigenisation, and the decolonisation of knowledge. In the process, it appears that the utility and value of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction and institutional language is disparaged with the purpose of annihilation, and furthermore that universities may increasingly become domains of ideological, and not intellectual, contestation. The article concludes by positing that the future of the university in a post-colonial local context will require a commensurate reconceptualisation of the role and functions of a university.","[Greffrath, Wynand] Noordwes Univ, Navorsingsfokusarea Sosiale Transformasie, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa","Greffrath, W (corresponding author), Noordwes Univ, Navorsingsfokusarea Sosiale Transformasie, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Wynand.Greffrath@nwu.ac.za,,,,,,48,1,1,0,12,"SUID-AFRIKAANSE AKAD VIR WETENSKAP EN KUNS, SEKRETARIS",PRETORIA,"P.

J,"du Plessis, T",,,,"du Plessis, Theodorus",,,"The revision of language policy at the University of the Free State, 2003-2015",TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,,,Afrikaans,Article,,,,,,Double-medium education; Monolingualism; Multilingualism; Multiculturalism; Medium of instruction; Education language policy; Parallel-medium education; Language policy; Language policy higher education; Language policy evaluation; Language policy review; Language diversity; Bilingualism,,"The article offers an overview of language policy review at the University of the Free State (UFS), from the inception of the university council's 2003 language policy up to the adoption of an entirely new policy in March 2016. This overview is undertaken against the background of theoretical insights about the role of the evaluation of effective policy implementation in policy review at higher education institutions. Several studies as well as some institutional reports since then have suggested that the UFS language policy needed to be reconsidered in view of drastically changing demographics in particular The underlying question that is considered in terms of relevant documentation available in the public space is therefore why the UFS did not respond earlier to warnings about the inappropriateness of a policy that had been implemented under completely different conditions back in 2003. Departing from international studies on policy review, the study specifically looks at the role of regulative factors in policy review. This is done in terms of an analysis of external core reports that, as far back as 2006 already, recorded shortcomings requiring corrective actions by the UFS. The role of specifically two reports published during 2008, namely the Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) institutional audit report and the Ministerial Committee's report on transformation and social cohesion and the elimination of discrimination in public higher education institutions (the so-called Soudien report), are considered. Incidentally, they are also foregrounded in a transformation report issued by the UFS towards the end of 2014, which turns out to have provided a basis for reinventing language problems that could eventually be used as a rationale for changing the UFS language policy. As these reports have identified a range of shortcomings in the 2003 language policy, the study was specifically interested in how the mentioned transformation report presented these findings and how the UFS responded aspects the transformation report omits. From publicly available documents, it is clear that the UFS has indeed responded appropriately and even revised aspects of implementing the existing language policy. With the changeover to a new leadership during 2009, these measures were not followed through and not even mentioned at all after 2010. Among others, the study finds that the UFS nevertheless did attempt language policy revisions in 2010 and 2012, which led to instilling a more pragmatic approach to language policy implementation. After the 2010 review, the notion was adopted of a university that (still) used English and Afrikaans as media of instruction, but not necessarily within a framework of absolute parallel-medium teaching and where English was used as a kind of mediating language within multicultural situations. Other policies were revised to reflect this new approach, among them the policy on the UFS's branding identity, employment equity and integration in hostels. After the 2012 revision, the notion was adopted that parallel-medium education will be offered where possible and practicable and that the use of Southern Sotho within the teaching and learning environment will be increased. These measures partly responded to the dwindling number of Afrikaans students that still opted for Afrikaans classes (by 2012 already below 30% of all students). The changes resulting from these two reviews notably went further than the corrective actions undertaken before 2010 under the former management. They were nevertheless not mentioned in the UFS's transformation report, nor did they feature in the 2015 review process. In order to reconstruct the entire 2015 language review process (which is the actual focus of the study), the run-up to the surprising announcement about a language policy review is studied in some detail. Neither the 2014 annual institutional report nor the UFS's 2015-2020 strategic plan (finalised towards the end of 2014) mentions any of the kind of concerns about the institutional language policy that were raised during 2015. On the contrary, this strategic plan in particular still reaffirms the status quo position regarding language. One therefore has to assume that consistent pressure from the Department of Higher Education and Training by means of the mechanisms envisaged by the 2008 Soudien report, the role of the Director of the UFS's Institute for Reconciliation and Social Justice and the increased demand for transformation from student quarters as a by-product of the #RhodesMustFall campaign, have all contributed to a change of heart by the university management regarding the language issue. In stark contrast with the position adopted towards the end of 2014, it was subsequently argued that the 2003 language policy was found to be inappropriate to promote transformation at the institution, a phrase that began to be propagated in official announcements and press releases. The article concludes that, because of a degree of neglect to execute actual language policy revisions (and thereby aligning revisions made in other policies) the university's management was eventually caught off guard by increased demands for transformation from all quarters. By inadvertently creating a hostile intellectual climate about the position of Afrikaans, the leadership could probably succeed without any policy revision to remove the existing bilingual language policy and replace it with a predominantly monolingual language policy. One therefore wonders whether Afrikaans became the culprit for the lack of proper and regular evaluation of a range of measures that were implemented at different stages in an attempt to realign the 2003 language policy with the changing circumstances at the UFS. In the end, this case demonstrates the importance of a meta-policy that helps to steer a university such as the UFS through troubled waters within an overall unstable higher education environment.","[du Plessis, Theodorus] Univ Vrystaat, Eenheid Taalfasilitering & Bemagtiging, Bloemfontein, South Africa","du Plessis, T (corresponding author), Univ Vrystaat, Eenheid Taalfasilitering & Bemagtiging, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",dplesslt@ufs.ac.za,"du Plessis, Lodewyk T/B-4224-2018","du Plessis, Lodewyk T/0000-0003-0982-4842",,,,59,2,2,1,6,"SUID-AFRIKAANSE AKAD VIR WETENSKAP EN KUNS, SEKRETARIS",PRETORIA,"P.

This review attempts to develop and explore a broad analytical theme the differing interconnections between gender, health and nature. The paper summarizes the interconnections that have been subject to extensive academic enquiry between gender and health, health and space, and gender and space. Methods: A combination of key terms including place; gender; health; outdoor space; green space; natural environment; national parks; femininity; masculinity; recreation; physical activity; sustainability; ecofeminism; feminism; environmental degradation; and environmental justice were used to search the electronic databases Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science and Scopus to identify relevant articles. We took two approaches for this review to provide an overview and analysis of the range of research in the field, and to present a framework of research that is an analysis of the intersection of gender, health and nature. Results: Four dimensions are distinguished: (1) evaluations of health benefits and 'toxicities' of nature; (2) dimensions and qualities of nature/space; (3) environmental justice including accessibility, availability and usability; and (4) identification of boundaries (symbolic/material) that construct differential relationships between nature, gender and health. This paper offers an understanding of how environmental and social conditions may differentially shape the health of women and men. The dimensions direct analytical attention to the diverse linkages that constitute overlapping and inseparable domains of knowledge and practice, to identify complex interconnections between gender, health and nature. Conclusion: This review therefore analyses assumptions about the health benefits of nature, and its risks, for gender from an in-depth, analytical perspective that can be used to inform policy.

As key institutions in the world's food system, retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers have taken steps to reduce food waste. Yet, while food corporations promote their food waste programs as part of their broader green sustainability initiatives, it is unclear how and why they have developed these initiatives. To fill this research gap, this study examines a US company's food waste reduction programs as a case study. To this end, this study utilises interview data of key stakeholders to examine the ways that food waste is produced, regulated, and reused by food corporations. Research findings point to some positive outcomes, such as the transformation of food waste into alternative energy and increased efficiency in food donation systems. Yet, these positive outcomes may be overshadowed by corporate priorities which privilege profitability, brand enhancement, and short-term high-visibility solutions. This research highlights that the broad and somewhat diffuse definition of sustainability may allow corporations to highlight narrow, company-specific technical fixes rather than do the hard work associated with reducing food waste in their supply chains. Moreover, data suggest that many food corporations use the sustainability trope as a way to ensure that they are recognised as legitimate, ethical, and profitable companies. Thus, while some argue that sustainable development institutionalises important environmental practices into the market, evidence from this study suggests that these corporate practices may be evidence of neoliberal environmental governance which is determined by market logics rather than environmental or social justice. In this way, corporate profitability determines how sustainability is defined, when and where sustainability is implemented, and how sustainability is to be measured.","[Warshawsky, Daniel N.] Univ Southern Calif, Spatial Sci Inst, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy,Hancock AHF B55B, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Warshawsky, DN (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Spatial Sci Inst, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy,Hancock AHF B55B, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",warshaws@usc.edu,,,,,,67,11,12,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0016-7398,1475-4959,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

The Hunter economy's strong basis in fossil fuel production and consumption is challenged by civil society campaigns employing environmental justice discourses. This paper analyses how two civil society campaigns in the Hunter region ('Stop T4' and 'Groundswell') have countered the regional hegemony of fossil fuel interests from an environmental justice perspective. However, the discursive dominance of the jobs versus environment' frame hinders efforts to build solidarity amongst local environmental justice goals on the one hand, and workers and union aspirations for secure, quality jobs on the other. Long-term structural decline of global coal markets adds pressure for economic transition. We argue that campaigns to open up possibilities for transition away from fossil fuel dependency to a post carbon society can be strengthened by engaging with the 'just transition' discourses that are typically associated with organised labour. Doing so can create synergy for social change by aligning community and labour movement interests. Inclusive social movement partnerships around this synergy must address structural disadvantage that creates social and economic insecurity if communities are to prevail over the fossil fuel sector's hegemony.

It is an open question, however, as to whether the accuracy of business students' knowledge of social justice issues in the United States affects student attitudes. We empirically examine whether the social justice knowledge deficits of management students affect student social and economic justice perceptions. Data were collected from business students (n = 222) at an AACSB-accredited business school at a comprehensive state university. Results indicate that students who are less accurate regarding where the United States ranks in reference to its OECD peers on social justice issues perceive current social justice policy and practice as more equitable, have lower levels of agreement with the goals of the Occupy Wall Street social justice movement, and are more likely to endorse GNP as an effective measure of a society's progress.","[Westerman, James W.; Bergman, Jacqueline Z.; Whitaker, Brian G.; Daly, Joseph P.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Management, ASU Box 32089, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Bergman, Shawn M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Psychol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Westerman, Jennifer] Appalachian State Univ, Goodnight Family Sustainable Dev Dept, 305 Bodenheimer Dr,Living Learning Acad Bldg 215, Boone, NC 28607 USA","Westerman, JW; Bergman, JZ; Whitaker, BG; Daly, JP (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Management, ASU Box 32089, Boone, NC 28608 USA.; Bergman, SM (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Psychol, Boone, NC 28608 USA.; Westerman, J (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Goodnight Family Sustainable Dev Dept, 305 Bodenheimer Dr,Living Learning Acad Bldg 215, Boone, NC 28607 USA.",westermanjw@appstate.edu; bergmanjz@appstate.edu; bergmans@appstate.edu; whitakerbg@appstate.edu; dalyjp@appstate.edu; westermanjh@appstate.edu,,,,,,56,0,0,1,1,GREENLEAF PUBL,SHEFFIELD,"AIZLEWOOD BUSINESS CENTRE, AIZLEWOODS MILL, NURSERY ST, SHEFFIELD, S3 8GG, ENGLAND",2051-8757,,,BUS PEACE SUSTAIN DE,Bus.

Projections of population and land cover at the census tract scale were combined with climate models for the year 2050 at 4 km x 4 km resolution to produce future summer temperatures which were input into a comparative risk assessment framework for the temperature-mortality relationship.

Understanding whether and how CCD design processes reconcile different stakeholder preferences can reveal how the concept contends with patterns of sociocultural and political oppression that condition patterns of development. We, therefore, explore procedural justice and power within CCD design through a case study analysis of two donor-funded projects in Malawi. Findings show that donor agencies are driving design processes and involving other stakeholders selectively. While considerable overlap existed between stakeholders' revealed priorities for CCD, invisible power dynamics encourage the suppression of true preferences, reducing the likelihood that CCD will be contextually appropriate and have widespread stakeholder buy in. Visible, hidden, and invisible forms of power create barriers to procedural justice in CCD design. We present five recommendations to help policy makers and practitioners to overcome these barriers.","[Wood, Benjamin T.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Quinn, Claire H.; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Wood, BT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",ee12btw@leeds.ac.uk,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654",Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy PhD studentship; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded through a Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy PhD studentship awarded to Benjamin T.

Though heretofore unexamined, an implication of Schneider and Ingram's model presented in Policy Design for Democracy (1997) is that the effects of policy with widespread outcomes should be rankable with respect to targets' social constructions, with Advantaged receiving less than Contenders who receive less than Dependents who receive less than Deviants of bad outcomes, and vice versa for good outcomes. Air pollution policies affect members of all four types of socially constructed groups, air pollution is well known to have social justice components, and air pollution is of particular interest because of its seeming universal application. So we performed an empirical, quantitative analysis of this rank-order hypothesis using data on air pollution in cities in California's Central Valley. The analysis finds evidence that social constructions of subpopulations in Central Valley cities help to explain the incidence of air pollution in the hypothesized rank-order way. The results provide new evidence of the value of the Schneider and Ingram (Policy design for democracy. University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, 1997) model in the area of outcomes, and new evidence regarding the social justice of seemingly universal policies.","[Al-Kohlani, Sumaia A.] Univ Sharjah, Dept Int Relat, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Campbell, Heather E.] Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Polit & Policy, 170 E 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Al-Kohlani, SA (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Int Relat, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",salkohlani@sharjah.ac.ae,,"Al Kohlani, SUMAIA/0000-0003-4586-0031",,,,91,1,1,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-2687,1573-0891,,POLICY SCI,Policy Sci.,DEC,2016,49,4,,,,,467,488,,10.1007/s11077-016-9251-3,,,22,"Public Administration; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EC1JC,WOS:000387859700006,,,,,2021-08-07,

The use of a transformative philosophical framework is presented as a way for evaluators to become more aware of the implications of various assumptions made by themselves and program stakeholders. The argument is examined and demonstrated that evaluators who are aware of the assumptions that underlie their evaluation choices are able to provide useful support for stakeholders in the examination of the assumptions they hold with regard to the nature of the problem being addressed, the program designed to solve the problem, and the approach to evaluation that is appropriate in that context. Such an informed approach has the potential for development of more appropriate and culturally responsive programs being implemented in ways that lead to the desired impacts, as well as to lead to evaluation approaches that support effective solutions to intransigent social problems. These arguments are illustrated through examples of evaluations from multiple sectors; additional challenges are also identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Koukouzelis, K",,,,"Koukouzelis, Kostas",,,Climate Change Social Movements and Cosmopolitanism,GLOBALIZATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; global social movements; cosmopolitanism from below; non-domination,GLOBALIZATION,"Following one of Gerard Delanty's recent arguments, if political philosophy is about the desirability or feasibility of norms, sociology is about the emergence and empirical existence of these norms. Cosmopolitanism has together with its normative dimension a cognitive and an epistemological one. It is because cosmopolitanism is basically a process, rather than a fixed condition, that the objectives of global justice are finally determined by public argumentation and reflect the outcome of social processes in which normative ideals are contested and de-contested'. I argue that there is a specific version of cosmopolitanism, which tries to incorporate, although not exhaust, the three dimensions mentioned above within its normative foundations. This version is called contestatory cosmopolitanism', and it is political rather than moral and prescriptive. Second, by focusing on social processes, it is mostly exemplified in global social movements. These social movements, through contestation of existing norms, unveil the essential cognitive dimension of cosmopolitanism as a learning process, which is based and enhanced by its normative foundation. Third, in relation to climate change, I show that climate justice social movements that come from below constitute the avant-garde of a cosmopolitan order to come, by producing critical knowledge of transformative potentials. Yet, contestatory cosmopolitanism', although empirically manifested in climate justice social movements, also justifies and shapes their claims.","[Koukouzelis, Kostas] Univ Crete, Philosophy & Social Studies Dept, Rethimnon, Greece","Koukouzelis, K (corresponding author), Univ Crete, Philosophy & Social Studies Dept, Rethimnon, Greece.",koukouze@uoc.gr,,,,,,52,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-7731,1474-774X,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,,2017,14,5,,,,,746,761,,10.1080/14747731.2016.1217621,,,16,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EV4PB,WOS:000401742100007,,,,,2021-08-07,

Critical systems theory understands cities as urban metabolisms, with different material and energy flows, highlighting the circularity in production, consumption, and discard. Waste pickers in low- and medium-income countries work on dumps and landfills, sifting through highly contaminated household waste and are exposed to health hazards. This paper discusses the risk factors, hazards, and vulnerabilities waste pickers are exposed to during collection and separation of recyclables, based on the review of literature on waste and environmental health and on findings from participatory research with waste pickers conducted in Brazil. We take a social and environmental justice perspective and identify the vulnerabilities and waste-borne hazards of household waste, associated with these workers, their communities, watersheds, and the environment. Household waste, although not always per se toxic or hazardous, can become a hazard if not collected or inadequately managed. Those communities where household waste is not collected or waste collection is insufficient are the most critical places. Informal and organized waste pickers, municipal or private waste collectors/workers, small waste traders and sometimes residents, particularly small children, may be considered vulnerable if exposed to waste-borne hazards. The results include recommendations to address household waste-borne hazards and vulnerabilities, according to waste workers involved in this research.

It seeks to help bridge the research gap regarding non-state actors' (NSAs) influence on the role of the nation-state and the United Nations in global political ecology and environmental policy, including emission reductions, such as antideforestation measures, and environmental justice. We consider NSAs as consisting of two heterogeneous global coalitions: a) civil society organizations (CSOs) and environmental non-governmental organizations, and b) peak corporate organizations with green economy objectives, here denominated green business organizations, representing transnational corporations (TNCs). After a review of prior studies, we present a version of an advocacy coalition framework; identify a timeline of changes in UN architecture and simplified NSA influence categories. We only begin to test very broad hypotheses on relative agency and to compare NSA narratives with UN documents. We show that the architecture of the UN has gradually shifted from favoring civil society to corporations. There is evidence that, in the late 1990s, in comparison with CSOs, TNCs increased their access to nation-states and UN agencies. The TNC narrative changed from a) denying climate change and ignoring the UN to b) recognizing change and guiding negotiations. These shifts in UN architecture, TNC agency and narrative appears to have influenced changes in UN documents towards a corporate global environmental framework, reducing their references to the regulatory and enforcement roles of the state and global binding agreements, shifting global debate towards a voluntary corporate orientation. This may have reduced prospects for reducing emissions and increasing environmental justice. Combining market mechanisms with strong regulatory frameworks is best practice for environmental policy. When nation-states have the will and capacity to command and control, they can reduce environmental degradation. Stronger national government competence and enforcement capacity and binding UN agreements are essential for the effectiveness of market incentives, which may be enhanced by business and civil society initiatives. If CSOs can reunite and regain their strength, maybe they could negotiate with TNCs on a more equal footing. Perhaps UN members could once again become comfortable with the idea of strong states and non-hegemonic global governance.","[Weiss, Joseph S.] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, CDS UnB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Zhu Dajian] Tongji Univ, Dept Publ Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Enriquez, Maria Amelia] Univ Fed Para, Econ, Belem, Para, Brazil; [May, Peter H.] Univ Fed Rural Rio De Janeiro, Grad Program Social Sci Dev Agr & Soc, CPDA, Seropedica, Brazil; [do Nascimento, Elimar Pinheiro] Univ Brasilia, Sociol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Pengue, Walter A.] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Inst Conurbano, Los Polvorines, Argentina; [Shmelev, Stanislav] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Weiss, JS (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, CDS UnB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",josephweissbr@gmail.com,"Shmelev, Stanislav E./K-1036-2017","Shmelev, Stanislav E./0000-0003-2103-0201",,,,96,0,0,0,7,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

The literature is reviewed with reference to various definitions of resilience, the relation between concepts of resilience and vulnerability, the conceptualization of resilience and the use of indicators, and the inclusion of social justice issues. The analysis shows that different disciplines employ various definitions of resilience and conceptions of its relation to vulnerability. Although recognized as important, distributive issues are not currently addressed in the literature.

We built from evidence in three city-regions that over the past years they saw the proliferation of community-based and policy-based initiatives with the aim to improve sustainability, livability and the aspiration to foster inclusivity and social justice in their cities: the city of Dresden in Germany, the city of Genk in Belgium and the city-region of Stockholm in Sweden.

In this chapter, urban green spaces are considered as one type of nature-based solutions that use urban ecosystem services to provide mitigation and adaptation actions and solutions to climate change and urbanisation related challenges. An overview over the relationships to urban health is presented. The city of Berlin is used as a case, to show how an unequal distribution of urban green area may be linked to an insufficient provision of ecosystem services and the related positive health outcome effect. This is discussed through the presentation of the distribution of different vulnerable population groups such as children and elderly people throughout the city area.

Despite rapid technical advances, research on climate-smart agriculture has arguably under-theorized the socio-political processes that continue to marginalize vulnerable groups such as smallholder farmers. This review discusses the potential usefulness of political ecology perspectives for improving climate-smart agriculture. Political ecology theory elucidates how three interrelated socio-political processes that perpetuate smallholder farmer vulnerability significantly influence climate-smart responses: inequality, unequal power relations and social injustice. The article discusses these three inter-connected political ecology factors using a number of examples from the Green Revolution, smallholder farming communities, and indigenous farmers. In comparison to conventional technical approaches, our article argues that Climate-Smart Agriculture needs to consider political ecology perspectives at different levels to explore the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to current and future climate change impacts. Interventions to support climate-smart agriculture should examine local risks, specificities and priorities of smallholder farmers. The article concludes with a renewed call for concepts of inequality, unequal power relations and social injustice to be embedded into both the policy and practice of climate smart agriculture.","[Chandra, Alvin; McNamara, Karen E.; Dargusch, Paul] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Chandra, A (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",a.chandra@business.uq.edu.au,"Chandra, Alvin/AAU-8641-2020; McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","Chandra, Alvin/0000-0002-2421-4412; DARGUSCH, Paul/0000-0001-9255-2803; McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403",,,,120,18,18,5,17,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

If we take the ontological turn in anthropology and other disciplines and its focus on indigenous ontologies seriously, however, we seem to end up in a situation that is difficult to maneuver in relation to conventional understandings of climate justice. When discussing climate change in relation to multiple ontologies, there are two risks: 1) reproducing what I call the coloniality of reality, arguing that indigenous ontologies are actually nothing but a cultural (mis-) representation of the world; 2) reproducing a conservative relativism that leads to nothing but the maintenance of status quo and that bears a resemblance to climate change denial. A thorough ethnographic understanding of what I would call the moral meteorology of the Andes and a broadened understanding of climate change, however, make it possible to navigate between the Scylla of coloniality and the Charybdis of relativism and to articulate a radical critique of fossil-fueled capitalism from a relational ontology, demanding climate justice while denouncing coloniality, and discussing the political ontology of climate change without ignoring its political ecology - and vice versa.","[Burman, Anders] Lund Univ, Human Ecol Div, Lund, Sweden","Burman, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Human Ecol Div, Lund, Sweden.",anders.burman@hek.lu.se,,"Burman, Anders/0000-0002-3161-2734",Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,The research upon which this article is based was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences.,,66,12,12,0,5,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Combining scientific understandings of allotropy in chemistry - describing the property of certain elements to manifest in various highly diverse forms - and the insights of Caribbean trickster stories, trickster carbon enables novel understandings of the multiple workings and effects of carbon as a material and cultural element. Rather than granting 'carbon' a singular seemingly-scientific meaning or reducing carbon to a singular problem that master human agents can ever definitively trap or sequester, this notion allows us to view carbon's unique ability to shape-shift in a variety of contexts and for myriad agendas. Understanding carbon in this way provides more than simply a theoretical or imaginative 'romp'; rather, this lens enables both a critique of the ways in which carbon is mobilized in practice as a profit-generating tool of colonial capture and also a generative opening for understanding carbon's potential as a connector to more transformative associations and postcolonial politics. As an ambivalent and paradoxical figure, trickster carbon offers a powerful method of cultural way-finding through the urgent concern of climate change.","[Girvan, Anita] Univ Victoria, Fac Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada","Girvan, A (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Fac Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada.",agirvan@uvic.ca,,,,,,45,4,4,0,3,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

How does evidence-based communication influence local residents' risk perception and potential behavior change in support of climate planning? Built upon our previous study of Climate Justice maps illustrating high scores of both social and ecological vulnerability in Michigan's Huron River watershed, USA, a quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effects of Climate Justice mapping intervention on residents' perceptions and preparedness for climate change associated hazards in Michigan. Two groups were compared: residents in Climate Justice areas with high social and ecological vulnerability scores in the watershed (n = 76) and residents in comparison areas in Michigan (n = 69). Measurements for risk perception include perceived exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability to hazards. Results indicate that risk information has a significant effect on perceived sensitivity and level of preparedness for future climate extremes among participants living in Climate Justice areas. Findings highlight the value of integrating scientific risk assessment information in risk communication to align calculated and perceived risks. This study suggests effective risk communication can influence local support of climate action plans and implementation of strategies that address climate justice and achieve social sustainability in local communities.","[Cheng, Chingwen] Arizona State Univ, Design Sch, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Tsai, Jiun-Yi] Northern Univ Arizona, Sch Commun, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Yang, Y.

Nonetheless, realising the transformative potential of fostering sustainable transition pathways is challenging. Our entry point for understanding this impasse is that the ability of cities to transform lies in the opaque spaces between policy rhetoric and implementation. We unpack these policy disjunctures in two ways. Firstly, we posit that the potential of the City to ensure that policy based on progressive and transformative principles is implemented in ways that foster the intended action is tied up with its ability to perform as a learning institution. The transformative role of learning is in turn dependent on accessing the situated tacit knowledge that informs decision-making and action. Secondly, we propose that researching the capacity of the City to learn requires alternative spaces for research and deliberation. To illustrate these arguments, we draw on a knowledge co-production urban experiment in Cape Town to improve the efficacy and analysis of both policy development and implementation. Tacit knowledge surfaced practices that are found to hamper learning within the City. Engaging with identified barriers to learning and change provides alternate entry points for identifying feasible points of leverage to address sustainability disjunctures.","[Greyling, Saskia; Patel, Zarina] Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Cape Town, South Africa; [Davison, Amy] City Cape Town, Environm Resource Management Dept, Cape Town, South Africa","Patel, Z (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Environm & Geog Sci Dept, Cape Town, South Africa.",zarina.patel@uct.ac.za,"Patel, Zarina/M-8391-2018","Patel, Zarina/0000-0002-5986-5653",Mistra; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental ResearchSwedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Sida; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,"This article is based on work undertaken as part of the Mistra Urban Futures programme, which is mainly funded by Mistra - the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research - and Sida - the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.",,60,8,8,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2017,22,,,1,SI,,52,65,,10.1080/13549839.2016.1223621,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,FQ6MV,WOS:000418479500005,,hybrid,,,2021-08-07,

While environmental justice questions are often focused on the location choices for specific activities that pollute, another important perspective is environmental justice over the life cycle of the production of products. Upon close examination renewable energies, critical alternatives to the fossil fuels which induce climate change, have environmental justice issues over their life cycles. Formal, statutory national law is not sufficient to address environmental justice problems along product life cycles in a world in which production is globalised and environmental effects pass beyond political borders. The responses to this challenge must draw on an interacting combination of information, custom, soft law, such as international standards and certification, and formal national laws. Through an interesting complex of intertwined effects, this system has already advanced our capacity to address environmental justice problems along product life cycles. The magnitude of the challenge and the complexity of the system demand ongoing effort and further innovation.

But despite its promising wording, the agreement does not provide for any binding enforcement mechanism. This basically means that liability law remains silent on issues of environmental damage. What would be needed, therefore, are effective enforcement mechanisms including novel forms of private law enforcement. When faced with the demand of climate justice, however, the law finds itself in a paradoxical state that can be described as an epistemic trap: On one hand, the law is unable to immunize itself against political or economical or other nonlegal communication. On the other hand, it does not appear to be able to achieve nonlegal policy goals, especially those given by norm-incentive models or ex ante consequentialism. But it is these epistemic limitations of law that provide for epistemic autonomy, thus for constructive freedom in a long-term self-reflective discovery process. In order to escape from the epistemic trap, the law needs to look beyond the traditional criteria of individual causation and fault, likewise transcending its own reality perceptions of actors as legal persons and subjects of responsibility.","[Gruber, Malte-Christian] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Am Main, Fachbereich Rechtswissensch, Frankfurt, Germany","Gruber, MC (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt Am Main, Fachbereich Rechtswissensch, Frankfurt, Germany.",gruber@jur.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,49,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-50932-7; 978-3-319-50931-0,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2017,4,,,,,,107,121,,10.1007/978-3-319-50932-7_5,10.1007/978-3-319-50932-7,,15,Business; Environmental Studies; Law,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law,BJ1SF,WOS:000418023700008,,,,,2021-08-07,

To do so, we review how equity is mobilised in the climate change economics literature and confront arguments about justice used within or at the periphery of climate negotiations with those of moral and political philosophers. We present the stances of States, NGOs and experts. We discuss the principles of justice underpinning the fair sharing of a carbon budget and their moral justifications.

It focuses on economic sustainability as a measure to address water security, placing this thematic in the context of a complicated power structure consisting of local, district and national administration as well as external development cooperation actors. The study aims to find out whether efforts to improve the economic sustainability of water schemes have contributed to water security at the local level. In addition, it will consider the interactions between water security, power structures and local equality and justice. The research builds upon survey data from the Nepalese districts of Nawalparasi and Palpa, and a case study based on interviews and observation in Nawalparasi. The survey was performed in water schemes built within a Finnish development cooperation programme spanning from 1990 to 2004, allowing a consideration of the long-term sustainability of water management projects. This adds a crucial external influence into the intra-state power structures shaping water management in Nepal. The article thus provides an alternative perspective to cross-regional water security through a discussion combining transnational involvement with national and local points of view.","[Hakala, Emma] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","Hakala, E (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",emma.hakala@helsinki.fi,,"Hakala, Emma/0000-0001-5020-9812",,,,65,1,1,0,9,"UNIV GRANADA, INST PAZ CONFLICTOS",GRANADA,"CALLE RECTOR LOPEZ ARGUETA S/N, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN",1988-7221,,,REV PAZ CONFL,Rev.

It provokes scholars to rethink their conceptions of accounts and nature, and alongside others in this AAAJ special issue, provides the basis for an agenda for theoretical and empirical research that begins to ecologise accounting. Design/methodology/approach - Utilising a wide range of thought from accounting, geography, sociology, political ecology, nature writing and social activism, the paper provides an analysis and critique of key themes associated with 40 years research in environmental accounting. It then considers how that broad base of work in social science, particularly pragmatic sociology (e.g. Latour, Boltanksi and Thevenot), could contribute to reimagining an ecologically informed accounting. Findings - Environmental accounting research overwhelmingly focuses on economic entities and their inputs and outputs. Conceptually, an information throughput model dominates. There is little or no environment in environmental accounting, and certainly no ecology. The papers in this AAAJ special issue contribute to these themes, and alongside social science literature, indicate significant opportunities for research to begin to overcome them. Research limitations/implications - This paper outlines and encourages the advancement of ecological accounts and accountabilities drawing on conceptual resources across social sciences, arts and humanities. It identifies areas for research to develop its interdisciplinary potential to contribute to ecological sustainability and social justice. Originality/value - How to ecologise accounting and conceptualise human and non-human entities has received little attention in accounting research. This paper and AAAJ special issue provides empirical, practical and theoretical material to advance further work.","[Russell, Shona] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Milne, Markus J.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Dey, Colin] Univ Stirling, Sch Management, Stirling, Scotland","Milne, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Christchurch, New Zealand.",markus.milne@canterbury.ac.nz,"Bui, Binh/AAX-2439-2020","Bui, Binh/0000-0001-5215-8879; Russell, Shona/0000-0002-3473-5019; Dey, Colin/0000-0002-8035-4807",,,,247,44,44,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0951-3574,1758-4205,,ACCOUNT AUDIT ACCOUN,Account .

Since communities are the basic building blocks of social they remain central to social innovation. Taking as its key examples the Indian Sundarbans in the Bay of Bengal and Zhangjiangkou Mangrove Forestry National Nature Reserve in Yunxiao county of Fujian province of China, the chapter shows how communities located on sites characterized by multiple marginalities (geographical, socioeconomic, and cultural) perceive and approach impacts of environmental unsustainability and incremental climate change in both material-physical and ideational-representational terms.

This article examines the contribution of FBAs to the debate on climate justice and their relation to and difference from the climate justice movement. Based on a constructivist assumption that the meaning of climate change can be interpreted differently, this article understands action on climate change as an effect of its discursive construction. This article argues that FBAs are part of these discourses and that their religious and spiritual practices are constituted and constitutive of climate justice practices.

The most solid evidence is for air pollution, leading to increased disability-adjusted life years. Outdoor temperature and other seasonal climate changes may also influence cardiovascular health, according to their direct modulation of air pollution. Moreover, an increasing body of evidence associates environmental exposure to noise with poor cardiovascular outcome, and in particular with hypertension. Methods: This review is aimed at reviewing current evidence about the role of these environmental factors in cardiovascular disease and specifically hypertension. In particular, the impact of air pollution, with its short-term and long-term effects, the outdoor temperature and noise pollution will be investigated. Conclusions: People belonging to low social classes, as well as children, women, older people and those with established cardiovascular diseases, seem to have a greater susceptibility to the effects of environmental stressors, recalling the concept of environmental justice. The accumulating strong scientific evidence may thus support public health policies aimed at reducing social inequalities in cardiovascular health.","[Bruno, Rosa Maria; Di Pilla, Marina; Taddei, Stefano; Virdis, Agostino] Univ Pisa, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Pisa, Italy; [Ancona, Carla] Lazio Reg Hlth Serv, Dept Epidemiol, Rome, Italy; [Sorensen, Mette] Danish Canc Soc, Res Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gesi, Marco] Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res & New Technol Med & Surg, Pisa, Italy; [Munzel, Thomas] Univ Med Ctr Mainz, Zentrum Kardiol, Kardiol 1, Mainz, Germany; [Munzel, Thomas] DZHK Standort Rhein Main, Berlin, Germany","Virdis, A (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Pisa, Italy.",agostino.virdis@med.unipi.it,"Munzel, Thomas/A-2912-2014; Taddei, Stefano/AAB-2828-2019; Bruno, Rosa Maria/C-3594-2015","Munzel, Thomas/0000-0001-5503-4150; Bruno, Rosa Maria/0000-0002-6107-3356",,,,104,11,13,3,30,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1381-6128,1873-4286,,CURR PHARM DESIGN,Curr.

By tracing the effects of colonialism, including global organic pollutants that move through seals into Inuit bodies, and based on Inuit responses to climate change, the writers argue, that we, who are not Inuit, are all potentially seal, in seal, of seal, through and for seal. The Wear Qisi design counters colonial designs by entangling the global world into Inuit-seal relations.","[Drum, Duskin] Univ Tyumena, Sch Adv Studies, Tyumen, Tyumenskaya Obl, Russia","Drum, D (corresponding author), Univ Tyumena, Sch Adv Studies, Tyumen, Tyumenskaya Obl, Russia.",,,"drum, duskin/0000-0001-9184-8709",,,,14,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1352-8165,1469-9990,,PERFORM RES,Perform.

By shifting to a justice framing of loss and damage, NGOs were able to expand their mobilization and, in turn, enhance their influence. While it is not claimed that NGO advocacy was sufficient to produce the outcome, pathways by which issue framing can support increased NGO influence via persuasion and coercion are illustrated. First, the justice frame garnered additional media attention and raised the stakes should states fail to include the issue in the Paris Agreement. Second, the climate justice frame helped forge alliances with vulnerable countries and within civil society that enhanced bargaining.

The tactics employed by diverse civil society agents to influence climate policymaking are radicalizing through the adoption of more confrontational language.

By scrutinizing efforts of three environmental NGOs (ENGOs) - Climate Action Network, Center for International Environmental Law and Carbon Market Watch - the analysis concentrates on what tactical shifts have occurred in the framing positions and approaches of these activists during the 1997-2015 period. After several years of legal advocacy, expertise and/or critique in an effort to reform input legitimacy of CDM governance, the selected ENGOs have recently drifted away from narratives of green governmentality and ecological modernization and, instead, radicalized their rhetorical tactics by turning to a human rights perspective under the umbrella of climate justice.","[Kuchler, Magdalena] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Kuchler, Magdalena] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden","Kuchler, M (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden.; Kuchler, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden.",magdalena.kuchler@geo.uu.se,,"Kuchler, Magdalena/0000-0001-8110-4538",,,,74,3,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

These cures, do not get to the root of the problem. Perhaps it is time for us to adjust our thinking to be more proactive instead of reactive in public health. Perhaps we need to consider confronting environmental pollution of air, soil and water at a local level. As the Physicians for Social Responsibility point out, we should be preventing what we cannot cure. One such preventive measure is ensuring that our communities, including our poor inner-city neighbourhoods, enjoy a clean environment. We challenge local and national policy-makers to respond to the global call and to take action to address environmental toxins; to take local action to ameliorate the pollution of the air, water and soil in so many of our nation's neighbourhoods. A person's neighbourhood, and the proximity of dangerous environmental contaminants within it, is a powerful predictor of how long s/he will live. While situations like the poisoning of the water in Flint, Michigan have gotten some attention, they are generally treated as the exception rather than a reflection of real environmental hazards that exist in the west. Moreover we wonder why more endemic issues of neighbourhood environmental contamination that shorten human lives are not a priority for local action or that it is not linked to disproportionate production of greenhouse gases that cause climate change/warming/chaos.","[Gilderbloom, John I.

Analysing higher education institutes' (HEIs) divestment press releases and news reports shows how institutional alignment with cultures of sustainability and social justice efforts played key roles in HEIs' decisions to divest from fossil fuels. Key stated reasons for rejection were: minimal or unknown impact of divestment, risk to the endowment, and fiduciary duty. Participant observation and interviews with protagonists reveal the intricate power structures and vested business interests that influence boardroom divestment decision-making. While some HEIs embrace transformative climate actions, we contend that higher education largely embraces a business-as-usual sustainability framework characterised by a reformist green-economy discourse and a reluctance to move beyond business-interest responses to climate politics. Nonetheless, the FFD movement is pushing HEIs to move from compliance-oriented sustainability behaviour towards a more proactive and highly politicised focus on HEIs' stance in the modern fossil fuel economy. We offer conceptual approaches and practical directions for reorienting sustainability within HEIs to prioritise the intergenerational equity of its students and recognise climate change as a social justice issue. Fully integrating sustainability into the core business of HEIs requires leadership to address fundamental moral questions of both equity and responsibility for endowment investments. We contend that HEIs must re-evaluate their role in averting catastrophic climate change, and extend their influence in catalysing public climate discourse and actions through a broader range of external channels, approaches, and actors.","[Healy, Noel; Debski, Jessica] Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, Salem, MA 01970 USA","Healy, N (corresponding author), Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, Salem, MA 01970 USA.",nhealy@salemstate.edu,,,,,,91,17,17,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2017,22,6,,,,,699,724,,10.1080/13549839.2016.1256382,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,EV4LB,WOS:000401730100004,,,,,2021-08-07,

These critiques have often demonstrated that such approaches can retain deleterious implications for certain vulnerable populations across the developing world and beyond. With few exceptions, however, political ecologists have paid decidedly less attention to expounding upon alternative initiatives for pursuing both sustainability and socio-environmental justice. Accordingly, the contributions to this Special Section engage the concept of the green economy explicitly as a terrain of struggle, one inevitably conditioned by the variegated forms that actually-existing 'green economy' strategies ultimately take in specific historical and geographical conjunctures. In doing so, they highlight the ways in which there is likewise not one but many potential sustainabilities for pursuing human and non-human well-being in the ostensibly nascent Anthropocene, each of which reflects alternative - and, potentially, more progressive - constellations of social, political, and economic relations. Yet they also foreground diverse efforts to pre-empt or to foreclose upon these alternatives, highlighting an implicit politics of precisely whose conception of sustainability is deemed to be possible or desirable in any given time and place. In exploring such struggles over alternative sustainabilities and the 'ecologies of hope' that they implicitly offer, then, this introduction first reviews the current frontiers of these debates, before illuminating how the contributions to this issue both intersect with and build upon them","[Cavanagh, Connor Joseph; Benjaminsen, Tor Arve] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, As, Norway","Cavanagh, CJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, As, Norway.",connor.cavanagh@nmbu.no; t.a.benjaminsen@nmbu.no,"Cavanagh, Connor Joseph/S-6902-2019; Benjaminsen, Tor A./V-4762-2018","Cavanagh, Connor Joseph/0000-0001-8373-2124; Benjaminsen, Tor A./0000-0003-0192-833X",Research Council of Norway (RCN) under its FRIPRO Toppforsk programmeResearch Council of Norway,"We would like to thank all of the authors for their patience and excellent inputs throughout the process of seeing the collection through to publication, and support from the project Greenmentality: a political ecology of the green economy in the global South funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN) under its FRIPRO Toppforsk programme.

Yet, the quantity of matter and energy used by human economies continues to increase by the minute, while governments and businesses continue to promise and to prioritize further economic growth. Such a paradox raises questions about how we humans change course. This introduction to a Special Section offers a new theoretical approach to change, together with glimpses of adaptations underway around the world. It directs attention away from individual decision-making and toward systems of culture and power through which socialized humans and socioecological worlds are (re) produced, sustained and adapted. Potential for transformative change is found in habitual practices through which skills, perspectives, denials and desires are viscerally embodied, and in cultural systems (economic, religious, gender and other) that govern those practices and make them meaningful. Case studies reviewed illuminate diverse communities acting to maintain old and to forge new moral and material worlds that prioritize wellbeing, equity and sustainability rather than expansion. This article endeavors to galvanize change by conceptualizing degrowth, by decolonizing worldviews of expansionist myths and values, and by encouraging connections between science and activism, north and south.","[Paulson, Susan] Univ Florida, Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Paulson, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",spaulson@latam.ufl.edu,,,,,,144,44,44,5,35,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Therefore, a literary review of the extensive normative theoretical discussion about global climate justice is made, with special attention to the two approaches that have permeated multilateral political negotiations - historical responsibility and equal per capita emissions. From this normative discussion, this paper recalls the global climate change negotiation process, focusing on the Kyoto Protocol. Next, the analysis emphasizes on the Paris Agreement in an effort to evaluate the normative questions on justice and equity within the environmental governance regime. Finally, the set of conclusions indicates that, although the flexibility of the Agreement has encompassed some dimensions of responsibility, necessity and ability to bear the costs, the most complex dimensions of justice and equity has not been completely solved, which may hinder the operation of environmental governance in a near future.","[Santos, Marcelo] Univ Estadual Paulista, Fac Ciencias & Letras, Araraquara, SP, Brazil","Santos, M (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Fac Ciencias & Letras, Araraquara, SP, Brazil.",msantos@fclar.unesp.br,"Santos, Marcelo/H-1815-2014","Santos, Marcelo/0000-0003-0151-4284",,,,34,2,2,1,16,INST BRASILEIRO RELACOES INT,BRASILIA DF,"CAIXA POSTAL 4400, BRASILIA DF, 70919-970, BRAZIL",0034-7329,,,REV BRAS POLIT INT,Rev.

Thirty-five MSW graduates took part in a semi-structured online survey regarding the quality of social justice knowledge and practice skills in their field instruction and coursework. The survey also examined how graduates employ social justice in their current social work practice. The majority of the study sample reported favorable educational outcomes and embraced social justice goals in their current practice. Discourse analysis of written comments, however, identified a disconnect between social justice theory, field education, and the overall climate of the social work program. Despite an explicit endorsement of social justice values by the program and the profession, graduates reported limited opportunities to learn anti-oppressive practice or apply social justice theories in their field education. We argue that the 'hidden curriculum' in social work education reflects market pressures that privilege task-oriented goals while 'mainstreaming' social justice rhetoric. Skills to confront oppression with transformative change are viewed as abstract goals and thus less useful than clinical practice.","[Bhuyan, Rupaleem; Bejan, Raluca] Univ Toronto, Fac Social Work, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jeyapal, Daphne] Thompson Rivers Univ, Fac Educ & Social Work, Kamloops, BC, Canada","Bhuyan, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Social Work, Toronto, ON, Canada.",r.bhuyan@utoronto.ca,,"Bejan, Raluca/0000-0002-2601-3964",,,,52,22,22,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0261-5479,1470-1227,,SOC WORK EDUC,Soc.

Adaptation policies recommend the managed realignment of the most vulnerable assets and activities. Despite their medium-and long-term benefits, these policies face significant friction due to social acceptability in the communities where they are implemented. This article investigates the hypothesis that respecting principles of justice in the implementation of managed realignment should increase its acceptability. We compare preferences of those people who are exposed to the risk of climate-change-induced flooding and those who are not, as regards funding managed retreat policies and defining compensation criteria for assets at risk. The main theories of social justice provide the four principles included in the analysis: efficiency, need, responsibility and priority assigned to property rights. A choice experiment survey was conducted with 258 residents of coastal and hinterland communities in the south of France. Four attributes were selected to define the managed realignment policy: the dialogue arrangements, the implementation period, the policy implementation schedule and the cost. The results show support for a relatively fast launch of these policies (within 15 years) but in stages and through a process of dialogue with the population. People's perceptions of the funding criteria reveal a preference for national solidarity. Finally, national funding of managed retreat policies and compensation criteria based on market prices have a significant positive influence on the acceptability of managed realignment policies, whereas introducing responsibility-based compensation criteria tends to favour the status quo over the adaptation policy. Policy relevance Prioritization of the funding criteria reveals the preference for national solidarity. Preferences for the justice criteria underpinning compensation reveal a great diversity of values. Besides implantation modalities, preferences for managed realignment policies depend on which level they are implemented at, on the expropriation criteria (the emphasis given to property rights, i.e. market price), on the attachment (people perceived as worst off, i.e. the property is their main residence rather than a second home or they have lower levels of income) and on the degree of responsibility (related to the date of purchase, i.e. on the information given at the time on the risk).","[Rulleau, Benedicte] Univ Versailles St Quentin Yvelines, CEARC, OVSQ, 11 Blvd dAlembert, F-78280 Guyancourt, France; [Rulleau, Benedicte] Irstea, UR ETBX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Rey-Valette, Helene; Clement, Valerie] Univ Montpellier I, LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France","Rulleau, B (corresponding author), Univ Versailles St Quentin Yvelines, CEARC, OVSQ, 11 Blvd dAlembert, F-78280 Guyancourt, France.; Rulleau, B (corresponding author), Irstea, UR ETBX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France.",benedicte.rulleau@irstea.fr,,"Rulleau, Benedicte/0000-0002-3659-5769","Liteau Program (French Ministry for Ecology, Sustainable development and Energy); Contrat de Projet","This work was supported by the Liteau Program (French Ministry for Ecology, Sustainable development and Energy) and the 'Contrat de Projet' between the State and the Languedoc-Roussillon Region under the SOLTER project 'Territorial Solidarity and Strategies for Coastal Resilience to marine flooding'.",,85,6,6,4,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Consequently, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have a long way to go in their negotiations before they have any hope of meeting their agreed temperature goals, and protecting human and non-human Capabilities from climate disasters.","[Lyster, Rosemary] Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lyster, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",rosemary.lyster@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,47,15,15,4,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Through the structural coding of 53 semi-structured interviews, recreancy was found even in a project where the sponsors used community cohesion as a guideline. This article illuminates the difficulties flood control project engineers face when working in local communities and argues that engineering issues are also social issues. Further, the relocatees within this flood control project voice some of the same concerns experienced by people relocated in other involuntary infrastructure development projects. The case outlined in this article could be used to better help those involuntarily relocated for flood control.","[Lynn, Kevin] Univ Florida, Dept Sociol Criminol & Law, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Lynn, K (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Sociol Criminol & Law, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",kevinlynn@ufl.edu,,,,,,32,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2017,22,3,,,,,321,334,,10.1080/13549839.2016.1195802,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,EO3VI,WOS:000396622100004,,,,,2021-08-07,

In this paper, I present the results of an advanced discourse analysis that analyses trends in the relationship between conflict and climate change. I present two primary discourses dominate discussion: (i) climate as a security risk and (ii) climate as one of many factors affecting power relations that may lead to conflict. Both narratives implicitly or explicitly discuss climate conflict as a cause-outcome relationship, and further primarily construct conflict and climate change within normative frames. Yet, conflict has transformative potential and can be incorporated into management in ways that harness its capacity to drive innovation and lead to more robust and just adaptive governance. I argue for a shift in the discursive frame from a cause-outcome-oriented approach to a process-driven approach, one that treats conflict as an integral part of adaptive governance processes, thus being more just and equitable. Such a shift in focus can lead to positive on ground climate adaptation outcomes, in ways that respect rather than are counterintuitive to dominant political and societal imbalances and institutional structures.","[Nursey-Bray, Melissa] Univ Adelaide, Geog Environm & Populat, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Nursey-Bray, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Geog Environm & Populat, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",melissa.nursey-bray@adelaide.edu.au,"Nursey-Bray, Melissa/J-8183-2019","Nursey-Bray, Melissa/0000-0002-4121-5177","Faculty of Arts, University of Adelaide","Thank you to my colleagues in the department of Geography, Environment and Population who critiqued this article when I gave it as a paper and thus strengthened it as a text.

However, when infrastructures are to be deployed, opposition is often found. Environmental justice-involving issues of distributive and procedural justice and recognition-and associated inter-group relations, has been identified as a key aspect for local opposition. However, research has rarely examined local perceptions of environmental justice and associated practices, such as energy colonialism, within a global perspective. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, we examine if and how different-level intergroup relations and collective narratives shape people's social-psychological and geographical imaginaries and responses to EIs. Focus groups were conducted with community members affected by proposals to construct high-voltage power lines in the UK. Analyses suggest that narratives around England's colonial history-within Britain and beyond Britain-shape responses to EIs.","[Batel, Susana] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Ctr Invest & Intervencao Social, Lisbon, Portugal; [Devine-Wright, Patrick] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England","Batel, S (corresponding author), Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Ctr Invest & Intervencao Social, Lisbon, Portugal.",susana.batel@iscte.pt,"Batel, Susana/AAO-4580-2020","Batel, Susana/0000-0002-6586-6716",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [207774]; Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology;  [SFRH/BPD/96061/2013],"This research was supported by the Research Council of Norway (SusGrid - Grant No. 207774).

Findings indicate varying levels of action and some examples of best practice, but overall, evidence indicates more effort is needed at the community level.

On the basis of seven cases from Belgium, a country with a strong commuting culture and a traditional tendency towards multimodality, we show that the conversion of a sustainability discourse into policy actions often leads to realisations which are essentially to be labelled as non-sustainable. On the one hand we discuss a number of cases where additional travel is unintentionally stimulated, with an unforeseen contribution to global warming as a result. On the other hand, we refer to cases where subsidies for sustainable transport modes seem to be geared towards wealthier groups, while poorer groups are exposed to additional expenses. The cases cover different steps of the policy process: (1) problem definition and selection of indicators, (2) the choice of a particular solution, and (3) the design of the chosen plan or programme, and illustrate the mechanisms underlying goal-displacements.

A new analytical framework to examine and test how moral reasoning underpins and legitimizes governance and practice on adaptation to climate change risks is proposed. It develops a typology of eight categories of vulnerability-based and system-based moral reasoning that pertain to the dilemmas around adaptation and examines the prevalence of these moral categories in public discourse about specific adaptation issues. The framework is tested using data on climate change impact, adaptation, and societal responsibility, drawn from 14 focus groups comprising 148 participants across the UK. Participants consistently use moral reasoning to explain their views on climate adaptation; these include both vulnerability-based and system-based framings. These findings explain public responses to adaptation options and governance, and have implications for the direction of adaptation policy, including understanding which types of reasoning support politically legitimate interventions.","[Adger, W.

Specifically, those with right-of-centre political views are typically less concerned and more sceptical about climate change. A significant challenge remains to move beyond this ideological impasse and achieve a more open and constructive debate across the political spectrum. This paper reports on novel mixed-methods research in the UK to develop and test a series of 'narratives' to better engage citizens with centre-right political views. Qualitative work in Study 1 revealed two particularly promising narratives. The first focused on the idea that saving energy is predicated on the 'conservative' principle of avoiding waste; the second focused on the advantages of 'Great British Energy' (based on patriotic support for domestic low-carbon technologies). An online experiment in Study 2 with a representative UK sample compared these narratives with a more typically left-of-centre narrative focused on the concept of 'climate justice' with a representative sample of the UK public. Results indicate that the first two narratives elicited broad agreement and reduced scepticism amongst centre-right participants, while the 'climate justice' narrative (which reflects a common environmental message framing) polarised audiences along political lines. This research offers clear implications for how climate change communicators can move beyond preaching to the converted and initiate constructive dialogue about climate change with traditionally disengaged audiences.

The theme of Local Food Systems (LFS) is a complex one, and therefore a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary effort, drawing on a myriad of research concepts and frameworks. The chapter begins by embedding the food debate within the broader sustainability discussion. It highlights issues around future demand and supply scenarios, current production and consumption patterns, and the challenges of addressing some of these issues in the context of climate change. The chapter also provides a review of some of the responses so far to counter the current unsustainability of the global agri-food system. Initiatives and concepts such as local food systems, localisation, food security and sovereignty are discussed, drawing on examples from both the Global North and South. Since the volume is about socio-metabolic approaches to agri-food systems, the chapter also introduces the conceptual and methodological underpinnings of this approach, and how this relates to political ecology, social conflicts and environmental justice. The chapter ends with an introduction to the various contributions in this volume that discuss the following cross-cutting issues: the necessity to consider local cases as nested in regional, national and global scales, including the debate on what might be an optimal scale for food regionalisation or sovereignty; the agenda of re-localisation and its political and ideological background in relation to biophysical/socio-metabolic insights with respect to LFS; the inclusion of trade in the methodological and ideological framework of LFS studies; the multi-functionality of agriculture and various related metrics of efficiency in agriculture (including the energy efficiency/EROI variables); the biophysical performance of other, more sustainability-focused, production regimes; the land-sparing versus land-sharing debate in connection to the biodiversity and landscape multi-functionality of both historical and existing agri-food systems; the role of livestock in various agri-food systems, and the related issue of meat consumption and dietary transition as part of a broader metabolic transition happening in many parts of the world; the issue of labour in terms of efficiency, and also in broader social and economic contexts; the political underpinnings of peasant livelihoods, existing social conflicts and uneven ecological exchange related to food; the issue of democratisation of food systems, access to means of production for fulfilling basic needs, and the agenda of food sovereignty. The contributors to this volume all ask the following two questions: Which local food systems or their particular characteristics can serve as the best practice examples for maintaining and designing more sustainable agri-food systems in the future? Which scientific and policy relevant insights can the socio-metabolic approach offer with respect to studying the sustainability of local food systems?","[Frankova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Environm Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Haas, Willi] Alpen Adria Univ, Fac Interdisciplinary Studies, Inst Social Ecol, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Singh, Simron Jit] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev SEED, Environm 3 Bldg,200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Frankova, E (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Environm Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",eva.slunicko@centrum.cz; willi.haas@aau.at; Simron.Singh@uwaterloo.ca,"Frankova, Eva/AAC-2778-2019","Frankova, Eva/0000-0001-5874-7690",,,,117,1,1,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-69236-4; 978-3-319-69235-7,HUMAN ENVIRON INTERA,,,2017,7,,,,,,1,24,,10.1007/978-3-319-69236-4_1,10.1007/978-3-319-69236-4,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Food Science & Technology,Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Food Science & Technology,BL1CZ,WOS:000447147300002,,,,,2021-08-07,

Objectives: Thinking seriously about ubuntu, as a shared collective humanness or social ethics, means to examine how Africans have framed a struggle for this shared humanity in terms of decolonisation and activism. Method: Three examples of applications of ubuntu are given, with two mainly linked to making explicit umaka. Firstly, ubuntu is linked to making visible the invisible inequalities for a common humanity in South Africa. Secondly, it becomes correlated to the expression of environmental justice in West and East African countries. Results: An African model of disability that encapsulates ubuntu is correlated to how Africans have illustrated a social ethics of a common humanity in their grassroots struggles against oppression and disablement in the 20th century. Ubuntu also locates disability politically within the wider environment and practices of sustainability which are now important to the post-2105 agenda, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the (UN) Sustainable Development Goals linked to climate change. Conclusion: A different kind of political action linked to social justice seems to be evolving in line with ubuntu.

We suggest that (1) governmental agencies provide the legal, regulatory, and management framework, but it is often the universities, conservation organizations, consultants, and the public that conduct the research and perform activities that lead to increased research and conservation efforts; (2) departments within agencies may have conflicting mandates, making it difficult to resolve differences in actions; (3) there is often conflict among and within state agencies and conservation organizations about roles and priorities; and (4) the role of the public is critical to ongoing research and conservation efforts. Identification of all the relevant stakeholders is necessary to recognizing competing claims, identifying the threats, deciding how to manage the threats, and enhancing population viability. Conflicts occur even within an agency when one department oversees science and protection of populations and another oversees and fosters an industry (aquaculture or fisheries, or permits for off-road vehicles). Conflicts also occur between resource agencies, industry, and conservation organizations. Recognizing the different stakeholders and their mandates, and encouraging participation in the process, leads to a better understanding of the threats, risks, and possible solutions when conflicts arise.

We quantify how three factors affect the relative benefits of ozone policies with household income: (1) unequal ozone reductions; (2) policy delay; and (3) economic valuation methods. We model ozone concentrations under baseline and policy conditions across the full continental United States to estimate the distribution of ozone-related health impacts across nine income groups. We enhance an economic model to include these impacts across household income categories, and present its first application to evaluate the benefits of ozone reductions for low-income households. We find that mortality incidence rates decrease with increasing income. Modeled ozone levels yield a median of 11 deaths per 100 000 people in 2005. Proposed policy reduces these rates by 13%. Ozone reductions are highest among low-income households, which increases their relative welfare gains by up to 4% and decreases them for the rich by up to 8%. The median value of reductions in 2015 is either $30 billion (in 2006 U.S. dollars) or $1 billion if reduced mortality risks are valued with willingness-to-pay or as income from increased life expectancy. Ozone reductions were relatively twice as beneficial for the lowest- compared to the highest-income households. The valuation approach affected benefits more than a policy delay or differential ozone reductions with income.","[Saari, Rebecca K.; Selin, Noelle R.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Selin, Noelle R.] MIT, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Thompson, Tammy M.] CSU Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, 1375 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Saari, Rebecca K.] Univ Waterloo, Civil & Environm Engn, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Saari, RK (corresponding author), MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Saari, RK (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Civil & Environm Engn, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",rsaari@uwaterloo.ca,"Selin, Noelle E/A-4158-2008","Selin, Noelle E/0000-0002-6396-5622; Saari, Rebecca Kaarina/0000-0001-7899-7558",U.S. EPA under Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program [R834279]; MIT's Leading Technology and Policy Initiative; MIT Energy Initiative Total Energy Fellowship; MIT Martin Family Society Fellowship; National Park Service [P14AC00728],"This work was carried out with support from U.S. EPA under Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program (no.

Site C threatens to flood traditional fishing spots and traplines of Indigenous peoples in the name of the 'green energy' economy. We consider how people displaced by renewable energy projects justified as climate mitigation policies might constitute a different kind of 'climate refugee' in that they are 'displaced without moving' - the connections between the land and the people are severed to the extent that what is lost is the ability of the people to sustain themselves in a place. We demonstrate that the focus on 'security' and 'risk' in dominant approaches to the phenomenon of climate migration within the international regimes of human rights and climate governance produces contemporary commitments to 'migration management' and a prescription for 'planned relocations' that employ an abstract conception of the 'climate migrant'. The analysis reveals that the dominant international legal order on climate migration is devoid of meaningful consideration of ongoing, embodied practices of living on the land. Its abstract, universalist conceptions of land, labour and livelihoods deny the possibility of people's meaningful relations with specific places and obscure the actual 'loss and damage' that transpires when real, material and ecological relations that ground people's connections with land are severed. We conclude that, without concerted resistance and a focus on re-making the underlying structural relations, a policy emphasis on renewable energy development as 'climate mitigation' is likely to continue to produce the same inequitable patterns of benefits and burdens as climate change itself.","[Scott, Dayna Nadine] York Univ, Osgoode Hall Law Sch, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Smith, Adrian A.] Carleton Univ, Dept Law & Legal Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Scott, DN (corresponding author), York Univ, Osgoode Hall Law Sch, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,87,8,8,3,23,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

How integration should be achieved is nevertheless a matter of international law development. At the regional level, a tendency seems to progressively emerge to ground integration in the fundamental right to a sustainable environment. Against such a background, it is argued in this article that a third generation environmental claim simplifies the complex establishment of a causal nexus between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and first and second generation fundamental rights. This would allow international human rights protection mechanisms to be triggered based on (minimum) reduction targets under the UNFCCC regime. The international recognition of a human right to a sustainable environment therefore emerges as fundamental to determining human rights responsibility for climate change, with particular regard to States. It thus facilitates systemically integrating fundamental rights into climate change regulation and taking consequential institutional action. This argument adds strings to the bow of those scholars who support the idea of intergenerational environmental justice on legal and moral grounds.","[Quirico, Ottavio] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Quirico, Ottavio] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr European Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Quirico, Ottavio] European Univ Inst, Fiesole, FI, Italy","Quirico, O (corresponding author), Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",oquirico@une.edu.au,,"Quirico, Ottavio/0000-0001-8268-7501",ANU Centre for European Studies Fellowship Programme,The author received financial support for research through the ANU Centre for European Studies Fellowship Programme.,,59,1,1,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0924-0519,2214-7357,,NETH Q HUM RIGHTS,Neth.

Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work.","[Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Woelfle-Erskine, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",cleowe@uw.edu,"Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo/AAL-8964-2020","Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo/0000-0002-4363-237X",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Directorate of Geography and Spatial Sciences,"The author acknowledges funding from a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the Directorate of Geography and Spatial Sciences.

The latter objective is often implemented without adequate human rights safeguards. Yet, with the climate change regime offering little or no means of effective redress for affected communities, with home states and project operators being under pressure to ensure timely completion of the project, and with the grievance mechanisms of lenders resulting in non-binding outcomes, the human rights regime potentially offers the greatest hope for victims in terms of access to justice. Despite such promise, however, the jurisdictional scope of application of human rights treaties poses potential barriers to climate justice. It is against this background that this article explores whether the particular situation of (climate) project finance falls within the ambit of extraterritorial human rights obligations. The article also considers (broader) extraterritorial obligations arising in the context of (climate) policies, in particular the obligation of home states to regulate those actors that they are in a position to exert influence over.","[Hofbauer, Jane A.] Univ Vienna, Dept European Int & Comparat Law, Vienna, Austria","Hofbauer, JA (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept European Int & Comparat Law, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Hofbauer, Jane/0000-0002-0120-617X","Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, ACRP 6th Call [KR13AC6K11043]","This article is based on research conducted in the context of the project 'ClimAccount - Human Rights Accountability of the EU and Austria for Climate Policies in Third Countries and their possible Effects on Migration (KR13AC6K11043)' funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, ACRP 6th Call, that was implemented by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights (Austria), the University of Bielefeld (Germany) and the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy (Germany).

In joining wider calls, we choose here to focus on the educational value afforded by understanding the epistemological bases of natural history and its particular forms of reasoning. We also briefly discuss the ways in which an education in natural history provides the foundation for environmental and social justice efforts that directly affect the lives of young people and their communities. We end by highlighting the ease by which natural history may be incorporated in learning opportunities both in and outside of the classroom.","[King, Heather] Kings Coll London, Sch Educ Commun & Soc, Waterloo Rd, London SE1 9NH, England; [Achiam, Marianne] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sci Educ, Oster Voldgade 3, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark","Achiam, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sci Educ, Oster Voldgade 3, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",achiam@ind.ku.dk,"Achiam, Marianne F/C-1350-2012","Achiam, Marianne F/0000-0003-1701-2959; King, Heather/0000-0002-2849-9398",,,,95,5,5,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

These models are necessarily simplified and incomplete, serving as rough ideal types that can help us make sense of policy choices with regard to climate change as decisions laying the foundations of our future societal development. Decisions taken now direct us along one path, often making other directions more obscure, inaccessible, or unthinkable. The outcome of each junction in the interplay of social forces opens and forecloses future possibilities for action within a given time frame. Some outcomes are easily overturned, others are 'definitive' for a generation or more. In the context of global warming and related ecological crises, what we humans choose to do within the next ten years can be expected to have irreversible consequences for many future generations. Notwithstanding the potential for capitalists to invent and commodify new 'post-carbon' technologies or to invent eco-system service-based commodities, questions are posed about the ecological sustainability of a mode of production that relies upon ever-expanding growth in material and energy through-puts. Is capitalism, ultimately, unthinkable in a steady-state system of production and consumption? Can capitalism dematerialize while wage-labour continues to define the mode of production? Or, as many in the global climate justice movement believe, will a just solution to global warming require far-reaching transformations of the global capitalist economic and social order? Will the properties of the renewable energy technologies that we are currently able to envisage (solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, hydro-electric, conservation, etc.) resist monopoly ownership and control and underpin more decentralized and democratic communities? These are questions with which the left is grappling in every context, including in Alberta, where an unprecedented opportunity for change opened up with the election of the New Democratic Party in May 2015 following many decades of government by conservative parties. In the first part of this article I outline, in general terms, emerging post-carbon visions or models of development. In the second part, I shift the focus of analysis to the observable sign-posts and possibilities for post-carbon transition in the Alberta context.","[Adkin, Laurie] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Adkin, L (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,61,5,5,0,7,SOC SOCIALIST STUDIES,VICTORIA,"C/O DAVID HUXTABLE, DEPT SOCIOLOGY, VICTORIA, BC V8W 3P5, CANADA",1918-2821,,,SOCIAL STUD,Social.

Despite the mainstreaming of justice obligations into the global forest governance architecture and the proliferation of justice practices across multiple scales of governance, claims of injustice persist. The growing prominence of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation plus the enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) as a primary mechanism for addressing global forest loss and degradation has again directed attention to the justice effects of global forest policies on forest peoples across the Global South. While REDD+ proponents argue that safeguard procedures and participatory processes will promote justice, opponents argue REDD+ will exacerbate injustices. To generate new insights into the persistent justice debates in REDD+, this paper draws attention to the role of norms in constraining and shaping policy designs and outcomes. It asks: to what extent and how does REDD+ as articulated in UNFCCC decisions respond to the established justice trajectory in global forest governance? How do current approaches in REDD+ create and constrain opportunities for justice for forest peoples? An empirical analysis of justice norms in global forest governance, including REDD+, demonstrate that while justice possibilities under REDD+ could narrow, opportunities for norm contestation are expanding. These additional opportunities can create conditions conducive to broader norm shifts in global forest governance.","[Suiseeya, Kimberly R.

As such, social workers are increasingly called to work in disaster settings across the globe and collaborate with many actors, such as faith-based humanitarian organisations. Unfortunately, disaster interventions may perpetuate the values and practices of neo-liberalism, colonialism and oppression without careful consideration and action. In this article, the author discusses the environmental causes and consequences of disasters in relation to risk and vulnerability, offering a brief case study of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. This is followed by a discussion of the importance of community participation for sustainable disaster recovery. The author concludes with some specific recommendations for decolonising disaster social work practice.","[Pyles, Loretta] SUNY Albany, Sch Social Welf, 135 Western Ave,Richardson Hall, Albany, NY 12222 USA","Pyles, L (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Sch Social Welf, 135 Western Ave,Richardson Hall, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",lpyles@albany.edu,,,,,,66,7,7,3,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0045-3102,1468-263X,,BRIT J SOC WORK,Br.

Significant contributions have been made to the development of concepts, methods, and applications for CRA over the past decade. Work in both human health and ecological cumulative risk has advanced in two different contexts. The first context is the effects of chemical mixtures that share common modes of action, or that cause common adverse outcomes. In this context two primary models are used for predicting mixture effects, dose addition or response addition. The second context is evaluating the combined effects of chemical and nonchemical (e.g., radiation, biological, nutritional, economic, psychological, habitat alteration, land-use change, global climate change, and natural disasters) stressors. CRA can be adapted to address risk in many contexts, and this adaptability is reflected in the range in disciplinary perspectives in the published literature. This article presents the results of a literature search and discusses a range of selected work with the intention to give a broad overview of relevant topics and provide a starting point for researchers interested in CRA applications.","[Fox, Mary A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Brewer, L.

The purpose of this article is to describe how principles of organizational consultation can be applied to cultivate a program-wide emphasis on social justice issues in school psychology training. In particular, this article reviews relevant literature on social justice education and describes an adapted 5-stage model of organizational consultation for coordinating cohesive program change.

While much of the resilience agenda has been shaped by policies and discourses from the global North, its applicability for cities of the global South, particularly African cities, has not been sufficiently assessed. Focusing on rights of urban citizens as the object to be made resilient, rather than physical and ecological infrastructures, may help to address many of the root causes that characterize the unacceptable risks that urban residents face on a daily basis. Linked to this idea, we discuss four entry points for grounding a rights and justice orientation for urban resilience. First, notions of resilience must move away from narrow, financially oriented risk analyses. Second, opportunities must be created for negotiated resilience, to allow for attention to processes that support these goals, as well as for the integration of diverse interests. Third, achieving resilience in ways that do justice to the local realities of diverse urban contexts necessitates taking into account endogenous, locally situated processes, knowledges and norms. And finally, urban resilience needs to be placed within the context of global systems, providing an opportunity for African contributions to help reimagine the role that cities might play in these global financial, political and science processes.","[Ziervogel, Gina; Pasquini, Lorena] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Pelling, Mark] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Cartwright, Anton] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Cape Town, South Africa; [Chu, Eric] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Deshpande, Tanvi] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Harris, Leila; Rodina, Lucy] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Harris, Leila] Stellenbosch Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Hyams, Keith] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Kaunda, Jean] Mzuzu Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Mzuzu, Malawi; [Klaus, Benjamin] ALAT, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Michael, Kavya] IIHS, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Pharoah, Robyn; Zweig, Patricia] Stellenbosch Univ, Res Alliance Disaster & Risk Reduct RADAR, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Scott, Dianne] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Cape Town, South Africa","Pelling, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za; mark.pelling@kcl.ac.uk; anton@econologic.co.za; E.K.Chu@uva.nl; tdeshpande@iihs.ac.in; lharris@ires.ubc.ca; K.D.Hyams@warwick.ac.uk; kaundajean@hotmail.com; benjamin.klaus@cimonline.de; kmichael@iihs.ac.in; lorena.pasquini@gmail.com; robynpharoah@sun.ac.za; lucy.rodina@gmail.com; diannescott.dbn@gmail.com; patriciazweig@sun.ac.za,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015; Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019; Michael, Kavya/AAC-4846-2020; Harris, Leila M/C-7156-2013","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809; Harris, Leila M/0000-0002-1700-1902; Michael, Kavya/0000-0002-2310-8263; Pharoah, Robyn/0000-0002-7291-371X; Rodina, Lucy/0000-0001-5470-9005; Pelling, Mark/0000-0002-6472-9875; Cartwright, Anton/0000-0002-2033-9162","research programme - UK Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), called Urban Africa: Risk Knowledge (Urban ARK project) [ES/L008777/1]; African Climate and Development Initiative Research Chair Fund, University of Cape Town; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/L008777/1] Funding Source: researchfish","The work presented has been financed by a research programme funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), called Urban Africa: Risk Knowledge (Urban ARK project number ES/L008777/1), and the African Climate and Development Initiative Research Chair Fund, University of Cape Town.",,86,108,109,12,102,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

As urban areas house highly diverse people with differing vulnerabilities, intensifying climate change is likely to shift the focus of discussions from a general urban perspective to who in cities will be affected by climate change, and how. This brings the urban equity question to the forefront. Here we assess how climate change events may amplify urban inequity. We find that heatwaves, but also flooding, landslides, and even mitigation and adaptation measures, affect specific population groups more than others. As underlying sensitivity factors we consistently identify socioeconomic status and gender.

Accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have-taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. Claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous San and Khoi have also launched demands-to date unmet-for a stake in rooibos benefits. Meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. All remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the South African apartheid system. The melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as the mother and testing ground of so-called access and benefit sharing. Such approaches stem in part from the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. With growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry. Drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. Through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach.

It has producer, electricity and transport fuel subsidies. It is at an interesting juncture in subsidy reform: the government faces the embeddedness of distributive justice norms that are contested by fiscal prudence and environmental stewardship norms. The value of the paper is twofold. First it develops a subsidy intractability framework to explain reform global narratives that highlights: the power of agents, the nature of contested economic, justice and environmental norms and the availability of mechanisms for reform. Second, this framework is used to explain reform narratives and trajectories in Trinidad and Tobago using data from public documents and from a unique elite survey of former and present heads of state, politicians, policy makers and stakeholders. Even in conditions of falling oil prices and national revenue and pressures to reduce emissions, where redistributive justice arguments are heavily embedded in public discourses, those aspects of the subsidy that have developmental or distributive justice goals are more intractable. The results of the study have implications for carbon emission reduction strategies in developing states with fossil fuel reserves.","[Scobie, Michelle] Univ West Indies, Int Law, Global Environm Governance, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Scobie, Michelle] Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago","Scobie, M (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Int Law, Global Environm Governance, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.; Scobie, M (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",michelle.scobie@sta.uwi.edu,,,,,,47,10,10,0,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104,,,,,,265,273,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.008,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,WOS:000397549500026,,,,,2021-08-07,

These include efforts to reverse current policy initiatives to combat climate change and protect the integrity of the national air and watersheds. The purported rationale, in sum, is that current policy initiatives to protect the environment are over burdensome and retard economic growth. This age-old argument is wholly focused on one side of the equation, the costs of regulation. However, in reality, these regulations also provide substantial benefits that, by all legitimate estimates, far outweigh the purported costs. At the heart of this cost-benefit analysis that underpins environmental regulations is the fundamental reason government becomes involved in environmental regulation in the first place: externalities. And when viewed objectively, we see that externalities disproportionately impact communities that are already marginalized. In fact, the marginalization of these communities is often directly associated with externalities. The purpose of this article is to discuss the current posture of the Trump administration toward environmental deregulation within the context of externalities. The goal is to remind us that most environmental problems emanate from externalities; that externalities do not cease simply by removing regulatory obstacles to their existence; and that externalities disproportionately impact marginalized communities.","[McGuire, Chad J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, Environm Policy, Dartmouth, MA USA; [Lynch, Devon] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Econ, Dartmouth, MA USA; [Lynch, Devon] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, Econ, Dartmouth, MA USA","McGuire, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, 285 Old Westport Rd, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",cmcguire@umassd.edu,,"McGuire, Chad/0000-0003-2480-4751",,,,20,3,3,0,20,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

It simultaneously ties that mapping into issues that are relevant to green, socio-ecological action. Important to the reflections that constitute the field of ecotheology has been a framing of responding to the ecological crisis. The present article begins by briefly introducing that feature of the field before offering an alternative, which is informed by principles of environmental justice. That alternative, namely a socio-ecological framing, is shown to be helpful in moving beyond a crisis-response dynamic.

It aims to achieve a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation financing over time. While there is a diplomatic history leading to this arrangement, we argue the GCF's allocation strategy requires further refinement if it is to adequately address climate change. We advocate prioritizing climate mitigation over adaptation in funding while not ignoring climate justice concerns all together. We recommend a more targeted approach to its funding allocations based upon the GHGs abatement potential for mitigation or climate vulnerability for adaptation of very specific non-Annex I countries. We believe these refinements will help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of scarce climate change financing resources required to achieve the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) central objective of no more than 1.5 A degrees C by 2100, which requires emissions reductions between 70 and 95% (2010 levels) by 2050.","[Brechin, Steven R.; Espinoza, Maria I.] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Brechin, SR (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",steven.brechin@rutgers.edu,,"Espinoza, Maria Isabel/0000-0003-1817-2233",,,,40,7,8,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The primary contribution of the article is its focus on six new frontiers of future energy justice research. First is making the case for the involvement of non-Western justice theorists. Second is expanding beyond humans to look at the Rights of Nature or non-anthropocentric notions of justice. Third is focusing on cross-scalar issues of justice such as embodied emissions. Fourth is identifying business models and the co-benefits of justice. Fifth is better understanding the tradeoffs within energy justice principles. Sixth is exposing unjust discourses. In doing so, the article presents an agenda constituted by 30 research questions as well as an amended conceptual framework consisting of ten principles.

The authors reconsider discourses on climate migration' in the light of everyday caring practices and adaptive responses to climate stress, evaluating how climate policy interferes with grassroots' flows of care. Early engagements tended towards alarmist predictions of mass climate-induced displacement, triggering proposals to secure' potential host nations against anticipated influxes. Recently, apparently more sober approaches have emerged, promoting labour migration as contributing positively to climate resilience'. These new approaches encourage more able and resourceful people from under-resourced, climate-vulnerable regions to join trans-local or transnational labour markets - which often equates with predominantly female care workers entering global care chains. Effectively, this means that those best equipped to provide care in places where it is most urgently needed end up providing care in relatively privileged, less climate-vulnerable places. Questioning the climate justice implications of this mobilization against the gradient of vulnerability, the authors offer suggestions about how climate policy could actually support caring practices in the places where ordinary people struggle at the sharp edge of climate change.","[Clark, Nigel] Univ Lancaster, Social Sustainabil & Human Geog, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Bettini, Giovanni] Univ Lancaster, Climate Polit & Int Dev, Lancaster, England","Clark, N (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",n.clark2@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Clark, Nigel/0000-0002-6666-1739",,,,86,2,2,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0038-0261,1467-954X,,SOCIOL REV,Sociol.

The challenges arise from declining biophysical conditions and the socio-political and economic barriers that delay, delegitimize or co-opt genuine community responses. Opportunities are arising from global climate change activism networks that provide new resources and discourses for activists and community organizers. These challenges and opportunities are unevenly shaped by the possibility for genuine democratic contestation in different contexts. In this article we draw on recent climate justice mobilizations in Aotearoa New Zealand. These mobilizations called for divestment from fossil fuel activities by blocking access to major banks around the country that directly support the industry. While most actions in the campaign were peaceful and effective in closing down business-as-usual for the day at specific bank branches, one in particular provoked police and implicit state-sanctioned violence against the activists, pitting bank customers against climate activists. We use this case study to illustrate the complexity of contemporary climate activism and tactics within communities, and draw on the work of Judith Butler to show how violence and stigma are used to discipline certain bodies who contest more dominant development trajectories and investment.","[Diprose, Gradon] Open Polytech, Sch Hlth & Social Sci, Lower Hutt, New Zealand; [Bond, Sophie; Barth, Jule] Univ Otago, Ihowhenua Dept Geog, Te Whare Wananga Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Thomas, Amanda C.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Environm Studies, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Whare Wananga Upoko Ika Maui, Wellington, New Zealand; [Urquhart, Heather] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England","Diprose, G (corresponding author), Open Polytech, Sch Hlth & Social Sci, Lower Hutt, New Zealand.",gradon.diprose@openpolytechnic.ac.nz,,"Diprose, Gradon/0000-0001-5394-9410",University of Otago Research Grant; Open Polytechnic Research Grant,"The research was jointly funded through a University of Otago Research Grant and Open Polytechnic Research Grant, for which we are grateful.",,29,5,5,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0010-3802,1468-2656,,COMMUNITY DEV J,Community Dev.

There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in the United States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the Big Horn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture, which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream. Therefore, building capacity to take control of land and water resources and preparing for climate change and drought at Wind River Reservation is of critical importance.","[McNeeley, Shannon M.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","McNeeley, SM (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, North Cent Climate Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",shannon.mcneeley@colostate.edu,,,Wind River Office of the Tribal Water Engineer; Wind River Water Resources Control Board; North Central Climate Science Center; U.S. Geological Survey through the North Central Climate Science Center,"The author thanks the tribes at Wind River Reservation, the Wind River Office of the Tribal Water Engineer, and the Wind River Water Resources Control Board as well as the North Central Climate Science Center for supporting this research.

At a multistakeholder workshop, participants identified seven obstacles to increasing justice-lack of resources, preparedness, social capital, transparency, representation, information, and utilization of community knowledge. Participants also identified opportunities to address injustice, particularly by seeking greater engagement and mutual education. Analysis of workshop dialogue revealed that policymakers' and community members' differing perspectives on time, vulnerability, environmental conservation, and knowledge are key-but not insurmountable-obstacles to addressing injustice.

While considerable progress has been made in bringing environmental considerations into the centre of our profession's scholarship and practice, this project is far from complete. Drawing on environmental literature and based on findings of a qualitative case study of water activism in one Canadian city, this paper argues that the concept of community resilience provides both a practical and a conceptual framework for advancing social work's engagement with issues of the natural environment and environmental justice through community praxis. Findings In Guelph, Ontario, Canada, water issues are the focal point of considerable community activism. The case study research reveals, however, that while water is the focus, much of this activism is driven by three broad social priorities that reflect ideas of community resilience and which suggest entry points for social work participation in community-based environmental initiatives: self-reliance and sustainability, localization and direct citizen participation, and community. Applications Community resilience is increasingly popular in environmental and community development fields as a conceptual framework for assessing and building the capacity of communities to support wellbeing in the face of environmental change, adversity and risk. While the concept of resilience is well established in social work, community resilience remains under-examined in social work literature. In this paper, the author draws attention to this arena of resilience thinking, highlighting its potential for the integration of considerations of the natural environment into social work scholarship, education, and practice.","[Case, Robert A.] Renison Univ Coll, Social Dev Studies, 240 Westmount Rd North, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G4, Canada","Case, RA (corresponding author), Renison Univ Coll, Social Dev Studies, 240 Westmount Rd North, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G4, Canada.",racase@uwaterloo.ca,,"Case, Robert/0000-0002-6366-5988",Doctoral Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was made possible by a Doctoral Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (2010/2011).",,62,10,10,1,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1468-0173,1741-296X,,J SOC WORK,J.

Environmentally-motivated migration and displacement may lead to the disruption of existing social ties, with potentially adverse consequences for mobile populations as well as their family members who remain in places of origin. We propose that the disruption of social ties is a key mechanism by which climate-related migration may negatively impact mental health, in particular. Existing social ties may provide social and material resources that buffer mental health stressors related to both prolonged and acute climate events. Preparation for such events may also strengthen these same ties and protect mental health. Communities may leverage social ties, first to mitigate climate change, and second, to adapt and rebuild post-disaster in communities of origin. Additionally, social ties can inform migration decisions and destinations. For example, scholars have found that the drought-motivated adaptive migration of West African Fulbe herders only occurred because of the long-term development of social networks between migrants and non-migrants through trade and seasonal grazing. On the other hand, social ties do not always benefit mental health. Some migrants, including those from poor regions or communities with no formal safety net, may face considerable burden to provide financial and emotional resources to family members who remain in countries of origin. In destination communities, migrants often face significant social marginalization. Therefore, policies and programs that aim to maintain ongoing social ties among migrants and their family and community members may be critically important in efforts to enhance population resilience and adaptation to climate change and to improve mental health outcomes. Several online platforms, like Refugee Start Force, serve to integrate refugees by connecting migrants directly to people and services in destination communities. These efforts may increasingly draw upon novel technologies to support and maintain social networks in the context of population mobility due to climatic and other factors.","[Torres, Jacqueline M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Torres, Jacqueline M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Hlth & Community, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Casey, Joan A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, Mulford Hall,130 Hilgard Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Casey, Joan A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Mulford Hall,130 Hilgard Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Torres, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.; Torres, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Hlth & Community, 3333 Calif St,Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.",Jacqueline.Torres@ucsf.edu,"Casey, Joan/H-6405-2019","Casey, Joan/0000-0002-9809-4695",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars programRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF); Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII); UC Berkeley Library,At the time of writing this manuscript the authors were supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars program.

The key concern to examine in this study was the dilemmas and measures confronting principals' when they led changes to instigate inclusive education in Hong Kong. Thus, this paper aims to report sources of dilemmas and how principals tackled them in the change process. Ten principals of schools recognized for effective inclusive education practices were interviewed in a qualitative study. Findings suggested that the process of leading change was very complex. Two dilemmas were identified: (a) principals' struggles between benefits and issues of participating in inclusive education and (b) autocratic initial decisions versus need for staff involvement. The second dilemma stemmed from not involving key staff while the implementation required their active participation. Thus, the existing organizational culture and personnel capacities became obstacles required for the success of inclusive education. The leadership measures to tackle the obstacles began by building a shared vision which in turn required both transactional and transformational leadership activities in order to increase teacher commitment to reforms. This study has contributed to change leadership theories in affirming the need to include socio-political contexts in examining leadership decisions toward school reforms.","[Poon-McBrayer, Kim Fong] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Educ Policy & Leadership, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Poon-McBrayer, KF (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Educ Policy & Leadership, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mcbrayer@eduhk.hk,,"Poon-McBrayer, Kim Fong/0000-0002-5961-0896","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee [840013]","Funding was provided by Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee (Grant No. 840013).",,64,7,7,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1389-2843,1573-1812,,J EDUC CHANG,J.

Primarily affecting policy types that have long been subsidized, the reconfigured program will result in these being converted to risk-based policies and this has produced concerns over policy affordability, especially for moderate- to lower-income households. The Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 does require the program's administrator, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to develop an affordability framework and program to present to the US Congress for enactment. These NFIP changes are considered in the context of its historic challenges and through the lens of risk perception studies and their social justice implications. Studies show that perception of flood risk is conditioned by experience with flooding as much as by economic factors, and coupling of flood risk and climate change in FEMA communications is likely to be counterproductive. More deliberative and collaborative engagement with at-risk communities is important. The NFIP changes might exacerbate social injustice, but less so than a retreat from or dismantling of the program.","[Shively, David] Univ Montana, Dept Geog, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Shively, D (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Geog, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",david.shively@umontana.edu,,,,,,44,9,9,2,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The purpose of this cross-cultural study is to understand how emotional responses to climate change are inequitably distributed across people living in island nations with varying climate change vulnerability. We consider how emotional responses (particularly sadness, worry, anger, happiness, and hope) may be related to people's biophysical vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and likelihood of relocation in the face of climate change. Using data from 272 ethnographic interviews collected in local communities in Fiji, Cyprus, New Zealand, and England, we explore the emotional reactions of respondents to current and future effects of climate change. Our results demonstrate that respondents in island nations with greater biophysical vulnerability are more likely to be concerned about relocation as a result of climate change, and they are also more likely to indicate their sadness or anger. Countries with higher adaptive capacity and lower biophysical vulnerability are more likely to suggest that, though they are sad about the effects of climate change, they feel neutral about its overall effect. This research demonstrates how focusing on emotional responses within communities affected by climate change brings important and under-explored dimensions of climate-related environmental injustice into sharp relief.","[du Bray, Margaret V.] Idaho State Univ, Dept Sociol, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [Wutich, Amber; Brewis, Alexandra] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Larson, Kelli L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [White, Dave D.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Resources & Community Dev, Tempe, AZ USA","du Bray, MV (corresponding author), Idaho State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Criminol, 921 S 8th Ave,Stop 8114, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",mvdubray@asu.edu,,"du Bray, Margaret/0000-0002-4295-3550; White, Dave/0000-0002-5518-1596","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0951366, SES-1462086]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1026865]; Divn Of Social and Economic SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1462086] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. SES-0951366, DMUU: Decision Center for a Desert City II: Urban Climate Adaptation; and Grant No. SES-1462086, DMUU: DCDC III: Transformational Solutions for Urban Water Sustainability Transitions in the Colorado River Basin.

We analyze how vulnerability changes over time and ask whether there is evidence of critical thresholds beyond which social vulnerability drastically changes. The review finds that climate change is expected to exacerbate current vulnerabilities and inequalities. The findings confirm concerns about climate justice, especially its intergenerational dimensions. For example, deficiencies in early childhood may limit future educational and income generation opportunities. Evidence of clear thresholds is rare and is mainly related to the vulnerability of different age groups, household income level, and the impacts of different degrees of global warming.","[Otto, Ilona M.] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Otto, Ilona M.; Reyer, Christopher P.

However, whilst calls for greater energy justice have grown, fleeting attention has been paid to the role and agency of the very people at the heart of this agenda. Clearly, given the increasing prevalence of local energy initiatives, such projects warrant more sustained focus both to explore how energy justice is constructed between settings and to prompt greater consideration of its associated outcomes. This paper seeks to address this gap by using energy justice to assess local ownership of small scale energy generation through a study of the community energy sector in Wales. In so doing, it aids greater understanding of the energy equity dimension, understood in terms of accessibility and affordability, of the energy trilemma. From a conceptual standpoint, the research examines how energy justice is negotiated and contested at community-scale through a focus on issues of distributive and procedural justice. From a policy standpoint, the research shows that community energy is often involved in a wide range of local objectives and directs attention to how best to support such initiatives to further stimulate local action and deliver more widespread equity gains.","[Forman, Alister] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales","Forman, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales.",FormanAK@cardiff.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J500197/1]; Welsh Government; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [1368238] Funding Source: researchfish,"This research was conducted as part of a three-year PhD award collaboratively funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant number: ES/J500197/1) and Welsh Government.

J,"Dietzel, A",,,,"Dietzel, Alix",,,The Paris Agreement - Protecting the Human Right to Health?,GLOBAL POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The Paris Agreement was largely viewed as a resounding success by those who took part in its negotiation. This paper examines whether these claims hold up to closer scrutiny. More specifically, the paper will assess whether the Paris Agreement protects the human right to health. Considering that the widely celebrated 1.5 degrees C target aims to protect present and future generations from the effects of climate change, which include substantial threats to human health, this is an especially pertinent area of study for climate justice theorists. Despite the threats climate change poses to human health, the subject of health has been somewhat neglected among climate justice scholars and policy makers alike. This paper illustrates that a focus on health can reveal much about the inadequacies of the Paris Agreement and multilateral climate change governance more widely. Unfolding in two parts, the paper first focuses on human health, explaining how this is threated by climate change and why a human rights based climate justice approach can highlight the importance of these threats and define what is morally required of policy makers. Part two of the paper turns to the assessment of the Paris Agreement, focusing on whether the policy makers who negotiated the Agreement have met these requirements. By briefly examining what has been promised in the Convention and what has been achieved under the Kyoto Protocol to date, the paper is able to assess whether the Paris Agreement represents a significant departure from the so far inadequate response to the climate change problem. It will be illustrated that although there has been a small step forward, the Paris Agreement cannot be said to represent a just response which protects the right to health of present and future generations.","[Dietzel, Alix] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Relat SPAIS, Bristol, Avon, England","Dietzel, A (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Relat SPAIS, Bristol, Avon, England.",,,"Dietzel, Alix/0000-0001-5647-799X",,,,25,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1758-5880,1758-5899,,GLOB POLICY,Glob.

We document five main political and institutional shifts within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and outline core governance practices for each phase. In discussing the current phase since the Paris Agreement, we offer to the emerging literature on international neoliberal environmental governance an analytical framework by which the extent of international neoliberal governance can be assessed. We conceptualize international neoliberal environmentalism as characterized by four main processes: the prominence of libertarian ideals of justice, in which justice is defined as the rational pursuit of sovereign self-interest between unequal parties; marketization, in which market mechanisms, private sector engagement and purportedly 'objective' considerations are viewed as the most effective and efficient forms of governance; governance by disclosure, in which the primary obstacles to sustainability are understood as 'imperfect information' and onerous regulatory structures that inhibit innovation; and exclusivity, in which multilateral decision-making is shifted from consensus to minilateralism. Against this framework, we argue that the contemporary UNFCCC regime has institutionalized neoliberal reforms in climate governance, although not without resistance, in a configuration which is starkly different than that of earlier eras. We conclude by describing four crucial gaps left by this transition, which include the ability of the regime to drive adequate ambition, and gaps in transparency, equity and representation.","[Ciplet, David] Univ Colorado, 397 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Roberts, J.

With a narrative of remarkable humaneness, Pope Francis' ecology discourse focuses on environmental emergency and misuse of resources, social and economic consumerism, notions of responsibility and exclusion of marginal communities. Based on an analysis of Pope Francis' encyclical letter, this article elaborates a framework for rethinking ecology in the context of the Pacific Islands Indigenous cultures who are suffering directly as a result of climate change. I suggest that Pope Francis' affirmative ecology promotes an integral and shared development, the intimately interdependent relationship between humankind and nature, which echoes the Pacific Indigenous intersubjective dimensions of environment. Environmental care and attention rely both on a moral individual and collective responsibility, rather than regulatory adjustments that underestimate traditional cultural and social practices. For Pacific Indigenous communities, Pope Francis' analysis is provocative, for it not only offers new hope for the future but also because it calls into question basic assumptions about global consumption and common ways of living that have negatively affected the environment of this region.","[Rawson, Stefania Varnero] Univ Notre Dame, Fremantle, WA, Australia","Rawson, SV (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Fremantle, WA, Australia.",stefania.varnero.rawson@nd.edu.au,,,,,,55,1,1,0,0,"UNIV SANTO TOMAS, ECCLESIASTICAL FAC",MANILLA,"ECCLESIASTICAL PUBLICATIONS OFF, ESPANA ST, MANILLA, 1015, PHILIPPINES",0115-9577,2651-7418,,PHILIPPINIANA SACRA,Philippiniana Sacra,SEP-DEC,2017,52,157,,,,,877,894,,,,,18,Religion,Religion,VI1TH,WOS:000461587100006,,,,,2021-08-07,

This must occur concurrently with an ongoing rise in total global energy consumption. While many modelled scenarios have been published claiming to show that a 100% renewable electricity system is achievable, there is no empirical or historical evidence that demonstrates that such systems are in fact feasible. Of the studies published to date, 24 have forecast regional, national or global energy requirements at sufficient detail to be considered potentially credible. We critically review these studies using four novel feasibility criteria for reliable electricity systems needed to meet electricity demand this century. These criteria are: (1) consistency with mainstream energy-demand forecasts; (2) simulating supply to meet demand reliably at hourly, half-hourly, and five-minute timescales, with resilience to extreme climate events; (3) identifying necessary transmission and distribution requirements; and (4) maintaining the provision of essential ancillary services. Evaluated against these objective criteria, none of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. Eight of 24 scenarios (33%) provided no form of system simulation. Twelve (50%) relied on unrealistic forecasts of energy demand. While four studies (17%; all regional) articulated transmission requirements, only two scenarios drawn from the same study addressed ancillary-service requirements. In addition to feasibility issues, the heavy reliance on exploitation of hydroelectricity and biomass raises concerns regarding environmental sustainability and social justice. Strong empirical evidence of feasibility must be demonstrated for any study that attempts to construct or model a low-carbon energy future based on any combination of low-carbon technology. On the basis of this review, efforts to date seem to have substantially underestimated the challenge and delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways.","[Heard, B.

The role of theology and imagination in climate ethics,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ANTHROPOCENE,"Some scholars and activists assume that climate change is entirely sui generis: a brand new kind of problem that calls for new kinds of thinking and activism. Others communicate the seriousness of climate change by arguing that it is prefigured by the biggest events in human history, such as the moral crime of slavery or the political challenge of World War II. While the choice between these two frames for climate change is often implicit, it shapes the research and arguments that follow. This can be illustrated by examining Christian theology and ethics: Those theologians who see climate change as sui generis tend to embrace the inevitability of apocalyptic change, increasing instability, and an Anthropocene age that calls for new kinds of religion and spirituality. Those who see climate change as prefigured, by contrast, tend to emphasize the continued relevance of established religious traditions, in particular their commitments to social justice and their opposition to destructive political and economic structures. The two approaches offer different frames for climate change and different theological imaginations of the problem. When the question of whether climate change is new and the imaginaries that question inspires are explicit, arguments in theology and ethics are clearer and more defined. Interdisciplinary connections then suggest that this exercise of exploring how climate change is framed, characterized, and imagined will be relevant to a wide range of scholars and activists.

Biometeorology is an interdisciplinary science connecting living organisms to their environment, but there is very little understanding of the existence and placement of this discipline within formal educational systems and institutions. It is thus difficult to project the ability of members of the biometeorological community-especially the biometeorologists of the future-to help solve global challenges. In this paper, we ask: At present, how we are training people to understand and think about biometeorology? We also ask: What are the current tools and opportunities in which biometeorologists might address future challenges? Finally, we connect these two questions by asking: What type of new training and skill development is needed to better educate biometeorologists of the future to more effectively address the future challenges? To answer these questions, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence from an educationally focused workshop attended by new professionals in biometeorology. We identify four common themes (thermal comfort and exposures, agricultural productivity, air quality, and urbanization) that biometeorologists are currently studying and that we expect to be important in the future based on their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Review of recent literature within each of these thematic areas highlights a wide array of skill sets and perspectives that biometeorologists are already using. Current and new professionals within the ISB have noted highly varying and largely improvised educational pathways into the field. While variability and improvisation may be assets in promoting flexibility, adaptation, and interdisciplinarity, the lack of formal training in biometeorology raises concerns about the extent to which continuing generations of scholars will identify and engage with the community of scholarship that the ISB has developed over its 60-year history.","[Allen, Michael J.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Geog, 7035 Batten Arts & Letters, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Vanos, Jennifer] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Climate Atmospher Sci & Phys Oceanog Dept, San Diego, CA USA; [Vanos, Jennifer] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, San Diego, CA USA; [Hondula, David M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Vecellio, Daniel J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, Climate Sci Lab, College Stn, TX USA; [Knight, David] Virginia Tech, Dept Engn Educ, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Mehdipoor, Hamed] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Dept Geoinformat Proc, Enschede, Netherlands; [Lucas, Rebekah] Univ Birmingham, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Fuhrmann, Chris] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Geosci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Lokys, Hanna] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Climatol Grp, Munster, Germany; [Lees, Angela] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Anim Sci Grp, Gatton, Qld, Australia; [Nascimento, Sheila Tavares] Univ Brasilia, Agron & Vet Med, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Leung, Andrew C.

However, the rate at which climate compatible development is being operationalised has outpaced academic enquiry into the concept. Interventions aiming to achieve climate compatible development wins (for development, mitigation, adaptation) can also create negative side-effects. Moreover, benefits and negative side-effects may differ across time and space and have diverse consequences for individuals and groups. Assessments of the full range of outcomes created by climate compatible development projects and their implications for distributive justice are scarce. This article develops a framework using a systematic literature review that enables holistic climate compatible development outcome evaluation over seven parameters identified. Thereafter, we explore the outcomes of two donor-funded projects that pursue climate compatible development triple-wins in Malawi using this framework. Household surveys, semi-structured interviews and documentary material are analysed. Results reveal that uneven outcomes are experienced between stakeholder groups and change over time. Although climate compatible development triple-wins can be achieved through projects, they do not represent the full range of outcomes. Ecosystem-and community-based activities are becoming popularised as approaches for achieving climate compatible development goals. However, findings suggest that a strengthened evidence base is required to ensure that these approaches are able to meet climate compatible development goals and further distributive justice.","[Wood, Benjamin T.; Quinn, Claire H.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Wood, BT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",ee12btw@leeds.ac.uk,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020",,,,,68,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

This article contributes to these debates by advancing two arguments. The first concerns the need for greater examination of how climate justice coexists and competes with more established political and justice considerations during the negotiation of climate policies. I argue that distinguishing analytically between normative interpretations of climate justice and justice claims made by parties affected by climate change or by mitigation or adaptation policies provides fertile ground for deepening understanding of the multivalent and relational nature of climate justice and confronting challenges to its incorporation into climate responses. The second argument concerns the importance of exploring how proponents and opponents of climate action strive to develop spatial anchors for justice claims to increase their legitimacy in policy debates. Based on analysis of carbon pricing controversies in Australia, the article illustrates how supporters of carbon pricing initiatives stressed international justice issues, whereas opponents mobilized multiscalar and multivalent international, national, regional, and local justice narratives to gain traction for their arguments. The article concludes by calling for further investigation of the multivalence of climate justice and of how climate justice might be spatially represented to advance its leverage in political debates on climate policy. ???????????????, ??????????????????????, ?????????????????, ???????????????, ???????????????????????, ????????????????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????, ???????????????, ??????????????, ??????????????????????????? ????, ??????????????????????????????, ???????????, ???????????, ?????????????????????????????????, ??????????????????, ???????????????, ????????????????, ??????????????????? Los ultimos anos han sido testigos de una notable atencion academica a la conceptualizacion de la justicia climatica y a la manera como sus ideas podrian movilizarse politicamente en los debates sobre politicas climaticas. Este articulo quiere contribuir en estos debates impulsando dos argumentos. El primero de ellos concierne a la necesidad de un examen mas grande del modo como la justicia climatica coexiste y compite con consideraciones de politica y justicia determinadas durante la negociacion de politicas climaticas. Sostengo que, al distinguir analiticamente entre las interpretaciones normativas de la justicia climatica y las demandas de justicia hechas por quienes se ven afectados por el cambio climatico o por las politicas de mitigacion o adaptacion, se provee un campo fertil para profundizar en el entendimiento de la naturaleza multivalente y relacional de la justicia climatica y confrontar retos a su incorporacion entre las respuestas climaticas. El segundo argumento se refiere a la importancia de explorar como los proponentes y adversarios de acciones climaticas se esfuerzan en desarrollar anclas espaciales para las demandas de justicia con el fin de incrementar su legitimidad en los debates sobre politicas. Con base en analisis de controversias sobre la cotizacion o precios del carbono en Australia, el articulo ilustra sobre la manera como quienes apoyan las iniciativas de esas cotizaciones enfatizan asuntos de justicia internacional, en tanto los opositores movilizan narrativas de justicia internacionales, nacionales, regionales y locales de caracter multiescalar y multivalente para ganar traccion para sus argumentos. El articulo concluye haciendo un llamado en pro de una mayor investigacion de la multivalencia de la justicia climatica y sobre como esta podria representarse espacialmente para promover su ventaja en los debates politicos sobre politicas climaticas.","[Bailey, Ian] Plymouth Univ, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England","Bailey, I (corresponding author), Plymouth Univ, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England.",ian.bailey@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Bailey, Ian/0000-0002-6865-8306","Research Council of Norway to the Fridtjof Nansens Institute, OsloResearch Council of Norway; International Diffusion (ETS-DIFFUSION)","The author acknowledges funding provided by the Research Council of Norway to the Fridtjof Nansens Institute, Oslo, for the project Designing Effective Emissions Trading: The Contribution of International Diffusion (ETS-DIFFUSION).",,90,2,2,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

Little is known about which subpopulations are more vulnerable to health risks from wildfire smoke, including those associated with fine particulate matter. We estimated exposure to fine particles specifically from wildfires, as well as the associations between the presence of wildfire-specific fine particles and the amount of hospital admissions for respiratory causes among subpopulations older than 65 years of age in the western United States (2004-2009). Compared with other populations, higher fractions of persons who were black, lived in urban counties, and lived in California were exposed to more than 1 smoke wave (high-pollution episodes from wildfire smoke). The risks of respiratory admissions on smoke-wave days compared with non-smoke-wave days increased 10.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.9, 19.6) for women and 21.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.4, 47.3) for blacks. Our findings suggest that increased risks of respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke was significantly higher for women than for men (10.4% vs. 3.7%), blacks than whites (21.7% vs. 6.9%), and, although associations were not statistically different, people in lower-education counties than higher-educated counties (12.7% vs. 6.1%). Our study raised important environmental justice issues that can inform public health programs and wildfire management. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, evidence on vulnerable subpopulations can inform disaster preparedness and the understanding of climate change consequences.","[Liu, Jia Coco; Peng, Roger D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Room 3137,615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Liu, Jia Coco; Ebisu, Keita; Bell, Michelle L.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Wilson, Ander; Wang, Yun; Dominici, Francesca] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mickley, Loretta J.; Sulprizio, Melissa P.; Yue, Xu] Harvard Univ, Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Liu, JC (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Room 3137,615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",coco.liu@jhu.edu,"Bell, Michelle/Y-4608-2018","Bell, Michelle/0000-0002-3965-1359","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [R01ES019560, R21ES020152, R21ES021427, R21ES022585, T32 ES007142]; US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)United States Environmental Protection Agency [83479801, 83587501]; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [83587101]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [R21ES021427, R01ES019560, R21ES020152, R21ES022585, T32ES007142, R01ES024332] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by grants R01ES019560, R21ES020152, R21ES021427, R21ES022585, and T32 ES007142 from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and grants 83479801 and 83587501 from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

While both approaches to biodiversity provide important information for the discipline of criminology, the implications of those approaches have very different implications for environmental discourse related to poverty and social justice.

To consider litigation's potential role in the movement and the challenges it may face, I examine the first and only case of litigation in the fossil fuel divestment movement thus far: Harvard Climate Justice Coalition et al. v President and Fellows of Harvard College et al.

I examine motivations for filing the suit in the context of the broader fossil fuel divestment movement, the case's history, and the challenges faced by the suit, including arguments surrounding causation, particularization, representation of future generations, limiting principles, and framing. I then discuss potential opportunities for fossil fuel divestment litigation in the future.

In this article I argue that, while the case for divestment is morally strong, not all of the arguments used to support divestment are equally strong. Moreover, which of these arguments is employed matters a great deal for the strength of the conclusions regarding divestment. There are two major groups of arguments: what I call positive arguments for divestment, which stem from the claim that divestment is a response to general duties to take action to prevent dangerous climate change, and what I call negative arguments, which stem from a duty not to cause harm. In this article I will briefly characterize what divestment means and to whom it applies. I will then look at negative and positive duty accounts of the duty to divest before looking at the standard objections to both. Objections have tended to cohere around the claims that divesting is inconsistent, useless and/or harmful, or should be abandoned for better options to avoid dangerous climate change.","[Moss, Jeremy] Univ New South Wales, Pract Justice Initiat, Morven Brown Bldg,High St, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Moss, Jeremy] Univ New South Wales, Polit Philosophy, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Moss, Jeremy] UNSW, Climate Justice Res Program, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Moss, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Pract Justice Initiat, Morven Brown Bldg,High St, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",j.moss@unsw.edu.au,,"Moss, Jeremy/0000-0002-3496-7928",,,,38,7,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0265-8240,1467-9930,,LAW POLICY,Law Policy,OCT,2017,39,4,,,,,412,428,,10.1111/lapo.12088,,,17,Law,Government & Law,FK3SX,WOS:000413407500006,,Bronze,,,2021-08-07,

While such claims may resist a key driver of the resource curse when applied to mineral resources in the ground, and are often recognized as among a people's territorial rights, their implications differ in the context of climate change, where they are invoked on behalf of a right to extract and combust fossil fuels that is set in opposition to global climate change mitigation imperatives. Moreover, granting full national sovereignty over territorial carbon sinks may conflict with commitments to equity in the sharing of national mitigation burdens, since much of the planet's carbon sink capacity lies within territorial borders to which peoples have widely disparate access. In this paper, I shall explore this tension between a global justice principle that is often applied to mineral resources and its tension with contrary principles that are often applied to carbon sink access, developing an analysis that seeks to reconcile what would otherwise appear to be fundamentally incompatible aims.","[Vanderheiden, Steve] Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Ketchum 115,333 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Vanderheiden, Steve] Charles Sturt Univ, CAPPE, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Vanderheiden, S (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Ketchum 115,333 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Vanderheiden, S (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, CAPPE, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",vanders@colorado.edu,,,,,,22,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1353-3452,1471-5546,,SCI ENG ETHICS,Sci.

Previous scholarship suggests that a democratic decentralized approach, one that fosters inclusive participation and representation, is central to achieving equitable and sustainable outcomes of adaptation. However, recent studies frequently characterize the adaptation process as dominated by a techoscientific approach, among expert and elite actors, that tends to obscure or neglect the perceptions and desires of more marginalized members of society. This paper employs a values-based approach to better understand motivational factors for a closed and non-inclusive adaptation process. Through a case study of early, yet formidable stages of adaptation planning in the urban, coastal region of Hampton Roads, Virginia, empirical data among the epistemic community were gathered by interviews and participant observation at de facto adaptation planning forums. Research results document an exclusionary process favoring the participation and representation of technocratic elites and the exclusion of elected officials and local citizens. When linking these case study findings to value theory, inferences are made that adaptation planning in Hampton Roads is motivated by dominant institutional actor values of power and security, those that are theorized to be in opposition to values fostering social and environmental justice. In light of these research results, this paper calls for a critically reflexive adaptation practice, thereby challenging values, assumptions, and beliefs of the self, as well as social structures and power relations that shape adaptation planning.","[Haverkamp, Jamie A.

Since the 1960s, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions implicated in the warming of our planet. There are also deleterious health outcomes linked to complex climate changes that are emerging in the 21st century. This article addresses the social justice issues associated with climate change and human health and discussion of climate justice. Organizing ConstructDiscussion paper. MethodsA literature search of electronic databases was conducted for articles, texts, and documents related to climate change, climate justice, and human health. FindingsThe literature suggests that those who contribute least to global warming are those who will disproportionately be affected by the negative health outcomes of climate change. The concept of climate justice and the role of the Mary Robinson FoundationClimate Justice are discussed within a framework of nursing's professional responsibility and the importance of social justice for the world's people. The nursing profession must take a leadership role in engaging in policy and advocacy discussions in addressing the looming problems associated with climate change. ConclusionsNursing organizations have adopted resolutions and engaged in leadership roles to address climate change at the local, regional, national, and global level. It is essential that nurses embrace concepts related to social justice and engage in the policy debate regarding the deleterious effects on human health related to global warming and climate change. Nursing's commitment to social justice offers an opportunity to offer significant global leadership in addressing the health implications related to climate change. Clinical RelevanceRecognizing the negative impacts of climate change on well-being and the underlying socioeconomic reasons for their disproportionate and inequitable distribution can expand and optimize the profession's role in education, practice, research, and policy-making efforts to address climate change.","[Nicholas, Patrice K.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Global Hlth & Acad Partnerships, Div Global Hlth Equ, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nicholas, Patrice K.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Nursing Excellence, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nicholas, Patrice K.; Breakey, Suellen] MGH Inst Hlth Profess Sch Nursing, 36 1st Ave, Boston, MA 02129 USA","Nicholas, PK (corresponding author), MGH Inst Hlth Profess Sch Nursing, 36 1st Ave, Boston, MA 02129 USA.",Nicholas.patrice@mgh.harvard.edu,,,,,,29,27,27,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1527-6546,1547-5069,,J NURS SCHOLARSHIP,J.

In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of UA practice on the Southside of Glasgow, UK that traced the emergence and development of four UA projects. Data from the four projects revealed a diversity of practices, including temporary gardening projects organised by local volunteers, a community and market garden operated by a charity, a food shop and vegetable distribution service run by a social enterprise, and a permanent growing space for charities and schools provided by local government. UA practitioners in Glasgow have sought to re-purpose vacant and derelict land, build social cohesion, contribute to environmental and food sustainability and provide participation space for marginalised groups. Reflecting on future avenues for research on UA in Glasgow, we have identified two broad policy pathways that are emerging both at the local level and through national legislation in Scotland to harness local urban food growing and support UA. We conclude by pointing to a need to preserve the self-organising spirit of UA in Scotland as new legislation comes into force.","[White, James T.] Univ Glasgow, Urban Studies, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Room 216,26 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G42 8QY, Lanark, Scotland; [Bunn, Christopher] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Room 224,27 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G42 8QY, Lanark, Scotland","White, JT (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Urban Studies, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Room 216,26 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G42 8QY, Lanark, Scotland.",jamest.white@glasgow.ac.uk; christopher.bunn@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Bunn, Christopher/0000-0001-6604-1305; White, James/0000-0002-6315-3165",University of Glasgow,"The authors would like to thank the Lord Kelvin Adam Smith Seedcorn Fund at the University of Glasgow for supporting this work with a small grant to fund data collection.

How government communicates climate change has a strong likelihood of influencing public perception about climate change. In this way, climate change is not simply an objective phenomenon observed in nature, but it also carries a conceptual construct in the human mind. Government institutions have the ability to influence climate change as both a physical phenomenon and a social construct formed in the public's eye. By withdrawing from international consensus on the real threat posed by climate change, the Trump administration not only influences the reality of climate change but also how climate change is understood as a social construct by the public and, as a consequence, how public institutions internalize the concept of climate change into their governance structures. The implications are potentially far reaching, with immediate negative consequences disproportionately accruing to marginalized communities. There is also potential for public disconnect to influence future, proclimate change administrations.","[McGuire, Chad J.] Univ Massachusetts, Environm Policy, Dept Publ Policy, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA","McGuire, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",cmcguire@umassd.edu,,"McGuire, Chad/0000-0003-2480-4751",,,,15,4,4,0,0,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

There is a fundamental contradiction between the prospect of unprecedented change as entailed by the Anthropocene and the deep continuity of a processual historical change. On the one hand, conceiving the Anthropocene as the prospect of the unprecedented creates a demand for immediate action to prevent future catastrophe. On the other hand, pointing out the inequalities in the historical process of bringing about the Anthropocene creates a demand for social justice. Although both are legitimate and important demands, they are incompatible. They represent different temporalities, different conceptions of change, and different modes of action. Inasmuch as the Anthropocene appears as unprecedented, it does not have a processual history; and inasmuch as it has a processual history, it is not the Anthropocene.","[Simon, Zoltan Boldizsar] Bielefeld Univ, Bielefeld, Germany","Simon, ZB (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Fac Hist Philosophy & Theol, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",zoltanbsimon@uni-bielefeld.de,"Simon, Zoltan Boldizsar/AAU-1518-2020","Simon, Zoltan Boldizsar/0000-0001-8763-7415",,,,26,7,7,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

We assess whether residents in a sub-tropical Australian city perceive green infrastructure as an effective climate adaptation response for reducing vulnerability to heat stress. Gold Coast City has pursued urban densification policies, such as reducing block sizes and increasing building heights, to accommodate rapid population growth. Little attention has been given to the combined impact of local heat island effects and global climate change upon lower-income residents in the city's suburban fringe, including rising energy costs associated with cooling homes. The study has three aims: to assess whether social disadvantage is associated with (1) concern about climate change impacts; (2) perceptions about the potential of green infrastructure to offer potential climate adaptive benefits; and (3) the desire for more urban greening in a working class suburb. We used a mail-back survey to elicit information related to cooling dwellings, awareness of, and concern about, climate change impacts, perceptions of the benefits of green infrastructure, and desire for more urban greening. Results indicate that despite their vulnerability to heat stress, comparatively disadvantaged residents are no more concerned about climate change; nor are they any more inclined to encourage local government to enhance neighbourhood greenery. These residents are, if anything, less likely to perceive benefits of urban greening. Our findings indicate that cultivating support for green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighbourhoods will require parallel efforts to redress inequality.","[Ambrey, Christopher] Univ Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Byrne, Jason; Matthews, Tony] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Davison, Aidan] Univ Tasmania, Geog & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lo, Alex] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ambrey, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",c.ambrey@uq.edu.au; jason.byrne@griffith.edu.au; t.matthews@griffith.edu.au; aidan.davison@utas.edu.au; chloeportanger@gmail.com; alexloyh@hku.hk,"Lo, Alex/B-7948-2008; Davison, Aidan GM/N-3863-2013; Byrne, Jason/AAC-6344-2019; Byrne, Jason/L-7140-2013","Lo, Alex/0000-0002-5953-4176; Davison, Aidan GM/0000-0002-5618-7068; Matthews, Tony/0000-0003-0838-5462; Byrne, Jason/0000-0001-8733-0333",Griffith UniversityGriffith University,"An earlier version of this manuscript was presented at the Institute of Australian Geographers Annual Conference 2016.

As communities, regulatory agencies, and policy-makers plan for rising seas, it is important to recognize the landscapes of race and deep histories of racism that have shaped the socio-ecological formations of coastal regions. If this history goes unrecognized, what we label colorblind adaptation planning is likely to perpetuate what Rob Nixon calls the slow violence of environmental racism, characterized by policies that benefit some populations while abandoning others. By colorblind adaptation planning, we refer to vulnerability mitigation and adaptation planning projects that altogether overlook racial inequality or worse dismiss its systemic causes and explain away racial inequality by attributing racial disparities to non-racial causes. We contend that responses to sea-level rise must be attuned to racial difference and structures of racial inequality. In this article, we combine the theory of racial formation with the geographical study of environmental justice and point to the ways racial formations are also environmental. We examine vulnerability to sea-level rise through the process of racial coastal formation on Sapelo Island, Georgia, specifically analyzing its deep history, the uneven racial development of land ownership and employment, and barriers to African American participation and inclusion in adaptation planning. Racial coastal formation's potential makes way for radical transformation in climate change science not only in coastal areas, but other spaces as situated territorial racial formations.","[Hardy, R.

During his campaign, Trump was openly hostile to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to the science of climate change. Since taking office, Trump's administration has taken steps to radically de-fund federal environmental agencies and roll-back environmental regulations, threatening the public accessibility of federal environmental datasets and continued monitoring of environmental harms. The Trump administration has also taken down information from federal environmental websites, such as the EPA's web pages explaining climate change to kids. This situation poses specific challenges for environmental justice (EJ) activism, as many EJ organizations rely on federal datasets and information on environmental risks, industrial emissions, and climate issues. Since November 2016, EDGI has focused on preserving existing federal environmental data, monitoring changes to federal websites, documenting the political transition through interviews with staff at EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and offering timely academic analysis of current events. Though EDGI's focus so far has been largely reactive to current political events, in this article we suggest a positive vision of environmental data justice, which we define as the public accessibility and continuity of environmental data and research, supported by networked open-source data infrastructure that can be modified, adapted, and supported by local communities. Environmental data justice also includes maintaining attention to long-standing EJ concerns about the politics of evidence, such as what counts as data, what data are collected, and whose interests they serve.","[Dillon, Lindsey] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Sociol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Walker, Dawn] Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shapiro, Nicholas] Chem Heritage Fdn, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Underhill, Vivian] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Feminist Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Martenyi, Megan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Polit, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Wylie, Sara; Brown, Phil] Northeastern Univ, Dept Sociol & Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lave, Rebecca] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Murphy, Michelle] Univ Toronto, Hist & Women, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Murphy, Michelle] Univ Toronto, Dept Hist, Toronto, ON, Canada","Dillon, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Rachel Carson Fac Serv, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",lidillon@ucsc.edu,,"Walker, Dawn/0000-0002-0741-7955",,,,25,14,14,1,13,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Method: We searched 5 electronic databases and selected issues/articles for social work plus a list of global environmental change topics. Inclusion criteria were: (a) published since January 1, 1985; (b) published in a peer-reviewed journal; (c) empirical; (d) is social work research; and (e) examines at least one topic related to global environmental change. From included studies, we extracted publication year, country setting, global environmental change topic(s), explicit/implicit examination of global environmental change, research design, and study focus. We extracted practice/policy implications as a subgroup. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulations were run in SPSS 23. Results: We identified 112 studies for inclusion. About 1/3 of studies examined hurricanes and typhoons, and most were conducted in U.S., Canadian, or Asian contexts. Many described consequences or coping with change, and although more than 1/3 of studies examined a formal response/intervention, rigorous outcomes-focused research is lacking. Conclusions: Scholars should diversify the topics and global settings that they study, and they should proactively engage with populations and systems before a crisis. There is a need for intervention research on global environmental changewith more rigorous methods of outcome measurementby social work scholars.","[Mason, Lisa Reyes; Shires, Mary Katherine; Arwood, Catherine; Borst, Abigail] Univ Tennessee, 408 Henson Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Mason, LR (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, 408 Henson Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",mason@utk.edu,,"Mason, Lisa/0000-0001-5386-4425","Center for Social Development, Washington University in St. Louis","This study was funded by the Center for Social Development, Washington University in St. Louis.",,157,16,17,0,35,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2334-2315,1948-822X,,J SOC SOC WORK RES,J.

Although decades of research have sought to understand factors which determine acceptance of environmental destruction, most of this research has been based on self-report surveys. In the present work, we used neuroimaging techniques to examine the neural correlates of environmental concern. To do this, we compared responses to observing suffering dogs with responses to observing suffering ecosystems. Our results extend previous findings which had shown largely overlapping neural response patterns to observing animal and human suffering. Critically, we found activation in regions previously identified as active in empathy processes in response to viewing harm to ecosystems (i.e., without any animals present in the images). We also found relative differences in response patterns between the two types of stimuli: witnessing harm to environments (vs. dog suffering) led to reduced activation in some regions, but similar activation in others. We discuss these findings in terms of their potential implications for behavioral interventions and possibilities for continued neuroimaging research examining neural responses to environmental ecosystems and other nonhuman entities.","[Geiger, Nathaniel; Bowman, Caitlin R.; Clouthier, Tracy L.; Nelson, Anthony J.; Adams, Reginald B., Jr.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, Moore Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bowman, Caitlin R.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Geiger, N; Adams, RB (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, Moore Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",nathangeiger@zoho.com; rba10@psu.edu,"Geiger, Nathaniel/X-9095-2019","Geiger, Nathaniel/0000-0003-1724-1081; Nelson, Anthony/0000-0002-1380-7087","Social, Life, and Engineering Sciences Imaging Center; Social Science Research Institute funds, Penn State University","This research was supported by the Social, Life, and Engineering Sciences Imaging Center and by Social Science Research Institute funds, Penn State University, to R.B.A. Jr.",,64,5,5,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-7466,1573-6725,,SOC JUSTICE RES,Soc.

A review,AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Review,,,,,,Agroecological practices; Animal production practices; Food system; Sustainable cropping practices; Organic farming,FOOD; MOVEMENT; ECOLOGY,"There is ongoing debate among stakeholders about the future development of agricultural and food systems to meet the global challenges of food supply, biological and cultural diversity, climate change, and social justice. Among other options, agroecology and organic agriculture are discussed. Both have similar goals and use a systems approach; however, they are recognised and received differently by stakeholders. Here we review and compare principles and practices defined and described in EU organic agriculture regulations, International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movement (IFOAM) norms, and agroecology scientific literature. The main finding are as follows: (1) Regarding principles, EU organic regulations mainly focus on appropriate design and management of biological processes based on ecological systems, restriction of external inputs, and strict limitation of chemical inputs. IFOAM principles are very broad and more complete, and include a holistic and systemic vision of sustainability. Agroecology has a defined set of principles for the ecological management of agri-food systems, which also includes some socio-economic principles. (2) Many proposed cropping practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology, e.g. soil tillage, soil fertility and fertilisation, crop and cultivar choice, crop rotation, as well as pest, disease and weed management. In contrast, the origin and quantity of products potentially used for soil fertilisation and pest, disease, and weed management are different. Additionally, some practices are only mentioned for one of the three sources. (3) In animal production, only a few proposed practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology. These include integration of cropping and animal systems and breed choice. In contrast, practices for animal management, prevention methods in animal health, animal housing, animal welfare, animal nutrition, and veterinary management are defined or described differently. (4) Related to food systems, organic agriculture focusses on technical aspects, such as food processing, while in agroecology there is a prominent debate between a transformative and conformative agenda. Both agroecology and organic agriculture offer promising contributions for the future development of sustainable agricultural production and food systems, especially if their principles and practices converge to a transformative approach and that impedes the conventionalisation of agro-food systems.","[Migliorini, Paola] Univ Gastron Sci, Piazza Vittorio Emanuele 9, I-12060 Bra, CN, Italy; [Wezel, Alexander] ISARA, Dept Agroecol & Environm, Lyon, France","Migliorini, P (corresponding author), Univ Gastron Sci, Piazza Vittorio Emanuele 9, I-12060 Bra, CN, Italy.",p.migliorini@unisg.it; awezel@isara.fr,,"Migliorini, Paola/0000-0002-8573-0381",,,,59,47,47,6,71,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

In particular, the idea that migration can represent a legitimate adaptation strategy has emerged strongly. This appears to be a positive development, marked by softer tones that de-securitise climate migration. However, political and normative implications of this evolution are still understudied. This article contributes to filling the gap by turning to both the climate refugees' and migration as adaptation' narratives, interrogating how and whether those competing narratives pose the question of (in)justice. Our analysis shows that the highly problematic climate refugees' narrative did (at least) channel justice claims and yielded the (illusory) possibility of identifying concrete rights claims and responsibilities. Read in relation to the growing mantra of resilience in climate policy and politics, the more recent narrative on migration as adaptation' appears to displace justice claims and inherent rights in favour of a depoliticised idea of adaptation that relies on the individual migrant's ability to compete in and benefit from labour markets. We warn that the removal of structural inequalities from the way in which the climate-migration nexus is understood can be seen as symptomatic of a shrinking of the conditions to posing the question of climate justice.","[Bettini, Giovanni] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Nash, Sarah Louise] Univ Hamburg, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CliSAP, Grindelberg 5, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany; [Gioli, Giovanna] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal","Bettini, G (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",g.bettini@lancaster.ac.uk; sarah.louise.nash@uni-hamburg.de; giovanna.gioli@icimod.org,,"Nash, Sarah Louise/0000-0002-3997-7877; Bettini, Giovanni/0000-0002-1191-1913","Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA); UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada; ICIMOD; government of Afghanistan; government of Australia; government of Austria; government of Bangladesh; government of Bhutan; government of China; government of India; government of Myanmar; government of Nepal; government of Norway; government of Pakistan; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom","Dr Gioli's contribution to this work received the support of the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

Primarily affecting policy types that have long been subsidized, the reconfigured program will result in these being converted to risk-based policies and this has produced concerns over policy affordability, especially for moderate- to lower-income households. The Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 does require the program's administrator, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to develop an affordability framework and program to present to the US Congress for enactment. These NFIP changes are considered in the context of its historic challenges and through the lens of risk perception studies and their social justice implications. Studies show that perception of flood risk is conditioned by experience with flooding as much as by economic factors, and coupling of flood risk and climate change in FEMA communications is likely to be counterproductive. More deliberative and collaborative engagement with at-risk communities is important. The NFIP changes might exacerbate social injustice, but less so than a retreat from or dismantling of the program.","[Shively, David] Univ Montana, Dept Geog, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Shively, D (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Geog, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",david.shively@umontana.edu,,,,,,0,3,3,1,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This study examined perceptions of the relationship between severe storms, sea level rise, climate change and ecological barriers by a vulnerable environmental justice population in New Jersey. Patients using New Jersey's Federally Qualified Health Centers were interviewed after Hurricane [Superstorm] Sandy because it is essential to understand the perceptions of uninsured, underinsured, and economically challenged people to better develop a resiliency strategy for the most vulnerable people. Patients (N = 355) using 6 centers were interviewed using a structured interview form. Patients were interviewed in the order they entered the reception area, in either English or Spanish. Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with environmental statements. Respondents 1) agreed with experts that severe storms were due to climate change, storms will come more often, and that flooding was due to sea level rise, 2) did not agree as strongly that climate change was due to human activity, 3) were neutral for statements that Sandy damages were due to loss of dunes or salt marshes. 4) did not differ as a function of ethnic/racial categories, and 5) showed few gender differences. It is imperative that the public understand that climate change and sea level rise are occurring so that they support community programs (and funding) to prepare for increased frequency of storms and coastal flooding. The lack of high ratings for the role of dunes and marshes in preventing flooding indicates a lack of understanding that ecological structures protect coasts, and suggests a lack of support for management actions to restore dunes as part of a coastal preparedness strategy. Perceptions that do not support a public policy of coastal zone management to protect coastlines can lead to increased flooding, extensive property damages, and injuries or loss of life.","[Burger, Joanna] Rutgers State Univ, Div Life Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Gochfeld, Michael] Rutgers State Univ, UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Environm & Occupat Hlth, Piscataway, NJ USA","Burger, J (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Div Life Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",burger@biology.rutgers.edu,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Preparedness and Response Research to Aid Recovery from Hurricane Sandy [CDC-RFA-13-001]; New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University; New Jersey Department of Human Services; New Jersey Department of Health; Division of Life Sciences, Rutgers University; NIEHS CenterUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P30ES005022]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P30ES005022] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Preparedness and Response Research to Aid Recovery from Hurricane Sandy (CDC-RFA-13-001) grant to New Jersey Department of Health, which included collaboration with the New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, New Jersey Department of Human Services, New Jersey Department of Health, and the Division of Life Sciences, Rutgers University, as well as the NIEHS Center (P30ES005022).

Some commentators hold that the idea of fairness is hopelessly equivocal on this point. Others claim that we need a complete theory of distributive justice to answer the question. This paper argues that on the contrary, given only weak assumptions about fairness, we can show that fairness requires an allocation that is at least as 'prioritarian' as the equal per capita view. Since even the equal per capita view is more prioritarian than is politically feasible, fairness is univocal enough for all practical purposes.","[Morrow, David R.] George Mason Univ, Inst Philosophy & Publ Policy, 4400 Univ Dr,3F1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Morrow, DR (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Inst Philosophy & Publ Policy, 4400 Univ Dr,3F1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dmorrow2@gmu.edu,,"Morrow, David/0000-0002-2025-429X",,,,47,2,2,1,11,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

In this context, carbon footprints have gained traction as a means of both quantifying individual responsibility for climate change and for motivating individual action through changes in behaviour. However, these mechanisms raise questions for climate justice in terms of how such moral and political responsibility is configured and distributed within the city. Drawing on a case study of Hong Kong, this paper explores the ways in which carbon footprinting configures responsibility for climate action by juxtaposing carbon footprints and the associated techniques of quantification alongside a discussion of the everyday practices of residents in a low-income neighbourhood. It argues that carbon footprints offer important opportunities for measuring the impacts of carbon-intensive activities and generating discussions about the allocation of responsibility for addressing climate change. However, it also demonstrates that individual carbon footprints ignore the uneven nature of carbon emissions in cities as well as obscuring important questions about the roles and responsibilities of other actors. In conclusion, the paper calls for an approach centred on common but differentiated responsibilities for carbon production and consumption to enable a more nuanced configuration of climate justice in the city.","[Fuller, Sara] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Fuller, S (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",sara.fuller@mq.edu.au,"Fuller, Sara/A-4640-2014","Fuller, Sara/0000-0002-9830-1615",City University of Hong Kong through an Idea Incubator grant; Sham Shui Po District Council,"The empirical research presented here was undertaken at City University of Hong Kong, funded through an Idea Incubator grant led by Maria Francesch-Huidobro.

This introductory essay proposes using the concept of pluralism to explore the multi-dimensional relationship between climate change and migration and to advance new perspectives and concepts to interpret the emerging theory of adaptive migration. The papers included in this themed section cover diverse issues in this area of research by focusing on the contemporary debate about the migration-as-adaptation strategy'. The papers address six key areas: the role of law in dealing with climate-induced migration, the category of place related to the community of origin and destination, the theme of climate justice and rights, the contribution of international organisations in framing the migration-as-adaptation strategy, adaptive measures developed in the Maldives, and seasonal nomadism in the East Sudan. All are quite different, but all converge in their emphasis on the role of the individual, the migrant, and on whether and how state responses are adequate in the progressive concordance between adaptation and individual capability.

Reconciling the development and environment imperatives needs to become an urgent priority for the Chinese government in order to avert the cascading implications that will arise in terms of social unrest, loss of further development opportunities as well as deepening income inequality. This paper thus examines the inter-relationship between the current ecological challenge in China and the need for economic sustainability. It evaluates the extent of environmental damage in China and focuses on the environmental impact on development and social inequality. The paper then examines the recent legislative measures that have been taken by the Chinese government to address the problem of inefficient environmental monitoring. The author suggests that further reform is needed to achieve an economically and ecologically just pathway for China's future. The paper therefore demonstrates that the environment-development challenge in China is mainly a challenge of governance.

The evidence generated by the other articles of the special issue were interpreted using social justice reasoning in light of additional literature, to draw out the key implications of health and social inequalities for health outcomes of climate change. Exposure to heat and cold, air pollution, pollen, food safety risks, disruptions to access to and functioning of health services and facilities, emerging infections and flooding are examined as the key impacts of climate change influencing health outcomes. Age, pre-existing medical conditions and social deprivation are found to be the key (but not only) factors that make people vulnerable and to experience more adverse health outcomes related to climate change impacts. In the future, climate change, aging population and decreasing public spending on health and social care may aggravate inequality of health outcomes related to climate change. Health education and public preparedness measures that take into account differential exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different groups help address health and social inequalities to do with climate change. Adaptation strategies based on individual preparedness, action and behaviour change may aggravate health and social inequalities due to their selective uptake, unless they are coupled with broad public information campaigns and financial support for undertaking adaptive measures.","[Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, CCCEP, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Paavola, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, CCCEP, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.paavola@leeds.ac.uk,"Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X",UK Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) Network; ESRC Centre of Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Publication of this article was funded by the UK Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) Network.

In contrast to an overly thin paradigm for justice that demands only a science-based assessment of potential temperature-related benefits and harms, we argue for the importance of attention to recognitional justice. Recognitional justice, we go on to claim, calls for a different type of assessment tool. Such an assessment would pay attention to neglected considerations such as relationships, context, power, vulnerability, narrative, and affect (amongst others). Here we develop a care-ethics related tool for assessing the justice (or injustice) of climate engineering with stratospheric aerosols, and suggest that qualitative social science methods may be required for its effective application. We illustrate the use of this tool with a case study involving interviews about stratospheric aerosol injection conducted in Kenya, the Solomon Islands, and the North American Arctic. Having shown through this case study the efficacy of the care approach for spotting recognitional injustice, we suggest that a care approach is not only sensitive to the considerations that count, it can also be powerfully normative.","[Preston, Christopher] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Carr, Wylie] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Atlanta, GA USA","Preston, C (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",christopher.preston@mso.umt.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES 0958095]; US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)United States Environmental Protection Agency [FP 917316],Research for this paper was supported by the US National Science Foundation [Grant Number SES 0958095]; and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)[Assistance Agreement No. FP 917316].,,43,10,10,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2155-0085,2155-0093,,ETHICS POLICY ENV,Ethics Policy Env.,,2018,21,3,,,SI,,308,323,,10.1080/21550085.2018.1562527,,,16,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ID6JF,WOS:000471783800004,,Bronze,,,2021-08-07,

Retrospective and Structural Wrongful Harm at the Bases of a Compensatory-Based Approach for Loss and Damage,ETHICS POLICY & ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Compensatory approaches to climate justice rely on powerful intuitions regarding responsibility and injustice. They appeal to one of our most deeply ingrained moral principles: those who have caused harm are those who should prima facie bear the responsibility of remedying it. However, in the context of climate change there are important epistemic and normative arguments that speak against applying this sort of principles. In this paper, I use the new developments of the science of attribution to reply to the epistemic concerns. I also provide countervailing normative reasons (based on recognition and self-respect) for the application of compensatory principles. I argue that the combination of two notions of wrongful harm - interactional and structural - would enable us to make the most of the normative force of an argument in favour of a compensatory view of climate justice.","[Garcia-Portela, Laura] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Philosophy, Graz, Austria","Garcia-Portela, L (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria.",laura.garciaportela@gmail.com,,"Garcia Portela, Laura/0000-0002-4666-1651","University of Graz; Research Project Self-Knowledge, Moral Responsibility and Authenticity (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) [FFI2016-75323-P]; 'La Caixa' foundationLa Caixa Foundation","I am grateful to Kian Mintz-Woo and Daniel Petz, from the Doctoral Programme in Climate Change at the Karl-Franzens-Universitat Graz for the conversation that encouraged me to write this response.

The article integrates scholarship in ethical leadership (EL) and social justice leadership (SJL). The resultant conceptualised model is an expanded version of a preliminary model included in a research brief of an empirical study. The Ethical Leadership Praxis in a Global Society model includes four interactive dimensions: (1) understanding social justice theory and leadership theory, (2) applying state, national and professional ethical/legal standards, (3) engaging in ethical leadership practice and role modelling for culturally responsive leadership (CRL), and (4) employing personal leadership ethics and core values as a cyclical process of self-reflection and decision-making. This article makes an original contribution for building leadership praxis centred on ethical leadership. The model applies ethical and social justice leadership theory and encourages leaders to self-reflect on their own values, practices of leadership and how their actions can create inclusivity.

When the forest is felled and the vegetation is burnt or decomposes, carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is released into the atmosphere. An approach designed to stem climate change is Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), a global financial mechanism that requires intricate governance requirements to be met-a significant challenge in the developing areas. In Panama, the government is responsible for designing and implementing a national REDD+ strategy with support from multilateral organizations. This case study is built through the experience of a public hearing on the potential implementation of REDD+ in the highly contested Upper Bayano Watershed in eastern Panama. The Upper Bayano Watershed is composed of vast and diverse forest ecosystems. It forms a part of the Choco-Darien ecoregion, a global biodiversity hotspot, and is home to two Indigenous groups (Kuna and Embera) and populations of migrant farmers (colonos), all with different histories, traditions, and worldviews concerning forests and land management, often resulting in territorial conflicts. A major socioecological issue facing the region is deforestation, which is driving biodiversity loss and landscape change and threatening traditional livelihoods and cultures. The public hearing stimulates difficult discussions about access to land, tenure security, biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, identity, power, trade-offs, and social justice. The case is designed to confront participants with the challenges of implementing ambitious, international, and often-prescriptive natural resource policies at local levels.","[Mateo-Vega, Javier; Potvin, Catherine] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mateo-Vega, Javier; Spalding, Ana K.; Potvin, Catherine] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Mateo-Vega, Javier] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia; [Spalding, Ana K.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hickey, Gordon M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Mateo-Vega, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Mateo-Vega, J (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama.; Mateo-Vega, J (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia.",javier.mateovega@mail.mcgill.ca,,"Spalding, Ana K./0000-0002-7110-9404","National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DBI-1052875]; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, McGill University; Margaret A.

The issues have intersected decisively, with staple food sources proving inaccessible for the world's poor, banks foreclosing on the most vulnerable, fuel sources causing war and impacting migration, and climate change-related instabilities shaking low-income communities to their core. At the same time, agrarian, environmental, indigenous and fishers' movements - among others - have used this moment to converge in their own right. This article explores this intertwining of social justice movements with an eye on such interrelated challenges. Its overall objective is, on one side, to provide some broad empirical brushstrokes on the intertwining of transnational social justice movements at the local, national and regional scales as they work with and trade frameworks of food sovereignty and climate justice.

The five deep social reforms of socially just land policy are necessarily intertwined. But the global land rush amidst deepening climate change calls attention to the linkages, especially between the pursuit of agrarian justice on the one hand and climate justice on the other. Here, the relationship is not without contradictions, and warrants increased attention as both unit of analysis and object of political action.

As the campus undergoes significant demographic change (e.g., UCSC's undergraduate population is 66% non- white and 43% are first generation college students), framings of sustainability must resonate with these increasingly diverse populations. The People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC) is a groundbreaking partnership between UCSC's Ethnic Resource Centers, Colleges Nine and Ten, and Sustainability Office. PoCSC's efforts to recognize, celebrate, and validate diverse understandings and expressions of sustainability is a response to evidence of exclusion among certain sectors of our student population. Based on a recent campus- wide survey, this paper compares and contrasts responses between white, non- Hispanic students and students of color in terms of their participation in and perceptions about the environmental sustainability movement, finding that the former participate at a higher rate and rate mainstream environmental concerns such as conservation of biodiversity as more important, while environmental justice issues such as food access were rated more important to students of color. However, many areas of convergence between the two groups was found, notably a broad agreement about the importance of environmental issues.","[Lu, Flora] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Rosser, Rebecca Hernandez] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Amer Indian Resource Ctr, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Renteria, Adriana] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ethn Resource Ctr, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Kim, Nancy] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Asian Amer Pacific Islander Resource Ctr, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Erickson, Elida] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sustainabil Off, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Sher, Anna; O'Connor, Lisa] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Res Assessment & Policy Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Lu, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",floralu@ucsc.edu; rrosser@ucsc.edu; arenter1@ucsc.edu; nikim@ucsc.edu; ekericks@ucsc.edu; asher@ucsc.edu; ljoconno@ucsc.edu,,,,,,8,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2199-7373,2199-7381,978-3-319-67122-2; 978-3-319-67121-5,WORLD SUSTAIN SER,,,2018,,,,,,,63,81,,10.1007/978-3-319-67122-2_4,10.4324/9781351103329,,19,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL4JD,WOS:000450481500005,,,,,2021-08-07,

It connects with its origin in Environmental Justice, as well as with the broader agenda of sustainable development that passes through the abandonment of fossil fuels. We then turn to the question of common but differentiated responsibility in the fight against climate change, as well as its multi-faceted and multi-scale nature. All this concludes in the connection of climate justice with a strong sustainable development that results in a new paradigm of Just Sustainability as a more integral proposal for the development of societies.","[Pardo Buendia, Mercedes; Ortega, Jordi] Univ Carlos III, Getafe, Spain","Buendia, MP (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III, Getafe, Spain.",mpbuendi@polsoc.uc3m.es; jordiortega@hotmail.com,,,,,,43,0,0,1,3,ASOC CASTELLANO-MANCHEGA DE SOCIOLOGIA,TOLEDO,"COBERTIZO SAN PEDRO MARTIN, S-N, TOLEDO, 45071, SPAIN",1575-0825,2172-3184,,BARATARIA,Barataria,,2018,,24,,,,,83,100,,10.20932/barataria.v0i24.415,,,18,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,GZ7JU,WOS:000449656000005,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

First, development is too often seen as the means to achieve more sustainable futures, even though experience points to complex and uncertain relationships between prosperity and sustainability. Second, while technological change is seen as essential to the transition, less attention is paid to the fact that disparities within societies demand differentiated solutions. Third, there are few principles in place for how to effect an energy transition with due attention to social justice in an unequal world.

However, neither emissions nor regulations are uniform world-wide, and hence the impacts of regulations are also likely to vary regionally. We report here an approach to model the effectiveness of regulations at different scales (local, regional, global) in reducing Hg deposition and fish Hg concentrations in the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL) region. The potential effects of global change on deposition are also modeled. We focus on one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, an Indigenous tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) with a high fish consumption rate. For the GL region, elements of global change (climate, biomass burning, land use) are projected to have modest impacts (<5% change from the year 2000) on Hg deposition. For this region, our estimate of the effects of elimination of anthropogenic emissions is a 70% decrease in deposition, while our minimal regulation scenario increases emissions by 35%. Existing policies have the potential to reduce deposition by 20% with most of the reduction attributable to U.S. policies. Local policies within the Great Lakes region show little effect, and global policy as embedded in the Minamata Convention is projected to decrease deposition by approximately 2.8%. Even within the GL region, effects of policy are not uniform; areas close to emission sources (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania) experience larger decreases in deposition than other areas including Michigan's UP. The UP landscape is highly sensitive to Hg deposition, with nearly 80% of lakes estimated to be impaired. Sensitivity to mercury is caused primarily by the region's abundant wetlands. None of the modeled policy scenarios are projected to reduce fish Hg concentrations to the target that would be safe for the local tribe. Regions like Michigan's UP that are highly sensitive to mercury deposition and that will see little reduction in deposition due to regulations require more aggressive policies to reduce emissions to achieve recovery. We highlight scientific uncertainties that continue to limit our ability to accurately predict fish Hg changes over time. Environmental significance Here, we project the responses within the Great Lakes region of rates of atmospheric deposition and fish mercury concentrations to changes in policy at multiple jurisdictional scales and to global change. We demonstrate that even within this region, responses to policy and global change drivers vary spatially with the largest reductions in deposition occurring in closer proximity to major Hg emission sources. Projected responses to atmospheric deposition are greater for U.S. policies than for either local or global Hg control policies. We focus further on the environmental justice implications of policy changes for fish mercury contamination facing one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, a tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with a high fish consumption rate. The Upper Peninsula is shown to be a highly sensitive landscape that readily converts atmospherically deposited Hg to bioaccumulated methylmercury, but one that will respond little to any of the policies evaluated. Thoughtful and more aggressive policy changes would be required to alleviate the existing environmental injustice.","[Perlinger, J. A.; Urban, N. R.; Hendricks, A.

Evidence from the literature suggests that resident participation enhances assessment of environmental risks, raises awareness and empowers residents to fight for equitable distribution of hazard and climate risk adaptations. Yet, risk assessment and urban planning processes still frequently operate within expertise-driven groups without significant community engagement. Such fragmentation results in part from a lack of appreciation for community expertise in built environment adaptations and educational tools to support resident involvement in the often technical built environment planning processes. Design/methodology/approach - A participatory research and place-based education project was developed that enhanced co-learning between residents and researchers while collecting and analyzing local data on flood resilience in the built environment. Five research activities constitute the curriculum of resilience education on stormwater infrastructure: establishment of partnership agreement/memorandum of understanding, participatory GIS to identify flooding issues, water quality testing and health survey, stormwater infrastructure assessment and urban/landscape design. Partners included high school and college students, residents and environmental justice organizations. Findings - Outcomes include a stakeholder-approved infrastructure assessment smartphone application, neighborhood maps of drainage issues, a report of water containments and neighborhood-scaled green infrastructure provisions and growth plans. Findings indicate that participatory research positively contributed to resilience knowledge of participants. Originality/value - This paper outlines an interdisciplinary pedagogical strategy for resilience planning that engages residents to assess and monitor the performance of stormwater infrastructure and create resilience plans. The paper also discusses challenges and opportunities for similar participatory projects.","[Meyer, Michelle Annette] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Sociol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hendricks, Marccus] Univ Maryland, Dept Urban Studies & Planning Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Newman, Galen D.; Masterson, Jaimie Hicks; Cooper, John T.; Sansom, Garett; Berke, Philip; van Zandt, Shannon] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX USA; [Gharaibeh, Nasir] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Horney, Jennifer] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, College Stn, TX USA; [Cousins, Tiffany] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA","Meyer, MA (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Sociol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mmeyer@lsu.edu,"Horney, Jennifer/ABG-2433-2020; Roslan, Ahmad Farhan/AAE-3178-2019","Horney, Jennifer/0000-0003-3060-0894; Sansom, Garett/0000-0003-3577-8114",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P42ES027704] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIEHS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P42 ES027704] Funding Source: Medline,,,63,10,11,7,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-5908,1759-5916,,INT J DISASTER RESIL,Int.

Yet there has been limited engagement between political ecology and the field of peace and conflict studies. This lack of connection reflects in part the broader disciplinary context of these two fields. Whereas political ecology research mostly comes from disciplines that eschewed environmental determinism, such as human geography, much of peace and conflict studies is associated with political science using positivist approaches to determine the causal effects of environmental factors on conflicts. Yet greater connections are possible, notably in light of political ecology's renewed engagement with 'materialism', and peace and conflict studies' increasingly nuanced mixed-methods research on environment-related conflicts. Furthermore, political ecology's emphasis on uneven power relations and pursuit of environmental justice resonates with the structural violence approaches and social justice agenda of peace and conflict studies. This article provides an overview of the differing conceptualizations and analyses of environmental conflict under the labels of political ecology and peace and conflict studies, and points at opportunities for closer connections.","[Le Billon, Philippe] Univ British Columbia, Liu Inst Global Issues, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Duffy, Rosaleen] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Le Billon, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Liu Inst Global Issues, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",philippe.lebillon@ubc.ca; r.v.duffy@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Duffy, Rosaleen/0000-0002-6779-7240",Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; European Research Council Advanced Investigator GrantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [694995],"Philippe Le Billon, Professor, Department of Geography and the Liu Institute for Global Issues, University of British Columbia, Canada.

This article examines racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in the spatial distribution of exposure to urban heat in the context of climate justice and residential segregation in the U.S. An urban heat risk index (UHRI) is calculated from measures of land surface temperature, structural density, and vegetation abundance, acquired from summer 2010 remote sensing imagery. Twenty of the largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. are selected and analysed using census tract-level socio-demographic data from the U.S. Census. Multilevel modelling is utilised to examine the statistical associations between urban heat, minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, and MSA-level segregation of racial/ethnic minority groups. Variables representing socioeconomic status (i.e. household income, home ownership, and education level) are consistently and significantly associated with greater urban heat exposure. Minority status and measures of segregation have a significant but varied relationship with urban heat exposure, indicating that there are inconsistent associations with urban heat due to differing social geographies. Urban heat and social vulnerability present a varying landscape of thermal inequity in different metropolitan areas, associated in many cases with residential segregation.","[Mitchell, Bruce Coffyn] Natl Community Reinvestment Coalit, 740 15th St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Chakraborty, Jayajit] Univ Texas El Paso, Socioenvironm & Geospatial Anal Lab, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Mitchell, BC (corresponding author), Natl Community Reinvestment Coalit, 740 15th St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20005 USA.; Mitchell, BC (corresponding author), CONTACT Bruce Coffyn Mitchell, Washington, DC USA.",bmitchell@ncrc.org,"Mitchell, Bruce Coffyn/J-4199-2013","Mitchell, Bruce Coffyn/0000-0002-8184-2757",,,,77,7,7,6,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2018,23,8,,,,,796,813,,10.1080/13549839.2018.1474861,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,GJ4EX,WOS:000435334400002,,,,,2021-08-07,

He described having such a policy in place as being akin to a factory preparing an evacuation plan in case of an earthquake: A vital precaution for something everybody hoped would never be needed. But what would that policy look like, how far forward would planners have to think, what issues are involved and who would be responsible for making sure it was effective? This article examines four key areas of concern that will have to be dealt with if an effective policy on climate change-induced migration is to be developed: Public perceptions, the law, maintaining Island culture and identity and changing the existing media narrative on social change. It identifies three groups of key players in the process: Legislators and legal experts, churches, and journalists.","[Cass, Philip] Unitec, Int Commun Programme, Auckland, New Zealand","Cass, P (corresponding author), Unitec, Int Commun Programme, Auckland, New Zealand.",cass.philip@gmail.com,,,,,,56,2,2,0,0,"AUCKLAND UNIV TECHNOLOGY, CREATIVE INDUSTRIES RESEARCH INST",AUCKLAND,"55 WELLESLEY ST E, AUCKLAND, 1020, NEW ZEALAND",1023-9499,2324-2035,,PAC JOURNAL REV,Pac.

This article describes the evolution of international law on climate change and examines the notion of climate justice for developing countries, particularly SIDS under the Paris Agreement. In order to make the most out of international law, Caribbean SIDS and Pacific SIDS have established regional agreements on climate change. African SIDS do not, however, have any similar framework for cooperation. This article presents an account of why and how African SIDS should consider a regional approach for climate change coordination. The article finds that African islands are under-represented in global climate change fora, despite the proliferation of climate change initiatives on the African continent. The prospect of a regional alliance is proposed as an opportunity for operationalizing the Paris Agreement. The adoption of a regional approach to climate change may address common needs, enhance the sharing of experiences, and provide a pool that dilutes risk for individual African SIDS. This article highlights the advantages and limitations of a regional approach, and offers a brief outline of the steps that should be taken toward a regional framework.","[Masini, Mariam Rita Fawole] Univ Aberdeen, Energy & Environm Law, Aberdeen, Scotland","Masini, MRF (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Energy & Environm Law, Aberdeen, Scotland.",,,,McGill Journal of Sustainable Development Law; British Government's Chevening Scholarship programme,"An earlier version of this essay received a Gold Medal in the 2017 Global Climate Law and Governance Essay Competition.

Remediating such risks is usually expensive, so requires action from state and/or federal governments. In turn, this requires political support for provision of a collective good, an altruistic action. We use data from a Mechanical Turk convenience sample to examine the influence of values and beliefs on donations to remediate water quality, using actual donations to an environmental group as our dependent variable. We find that views about minorities are the strongest predictor of donations, with symbolic racism-beliefs that minorities have received advantageous treatment-substantially reducing donations. In addition, altruistic values have an indirect effect of increasing the likelihood of donating while self-interested values reduce donations. It appears that support for collective action on water quality is closely tied with both altruism and racial views, suggesting links between research on environmental justice and on environmental decision-making.","[Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dietz, Thomas; Duan, Ran; Nalley, Jakob; Van Witsen, Anthony] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Duan, Ran; Van Witsen, Anthony] Michigan State Univ, Dept Journalism, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Nalley, Jakob] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrated Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Dietz, T (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Dietz, T (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",tdietz@msu.edu,,,Michigan AgBio Research; Michigan State University,"This research was supported in part by Michigan AgBio Research and the Environmental Science and Policy Program, both of Michigan State University.

A goal of CCA projects is to reduce poverty and promote social justice. The case of the threat of displacement of the community of Kewunor by the Trasacco Estate Development Company (TEDC), after the construction of the Ada Sea Defense System (AdSDS) of Ghana as a CCA, is illustrative of this concept of (mal)adaptation opportunism. Through a narrative presentation of eight different accounts concerning this issue, I demonstrate how (mal)adaptation opportunism arises and is often motivated by economic interests. This case illustrates how economic interests can take over not only CCA projects but also their maladaptive effects.","[Owusu-Daaku, Kwame N.] Univ West Florida, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA","Owusu-Daaku, KN (corresponding author), Univ West Florida, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA.",kowusudaaku@uwf.edu,,,"International Development Research Centre [IDRC 107642]; Office of the Vice President for Research, University of South Carolina [SPARC]; United States Agency for International DevelopmentUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) [Borlaug LEAP]","This work was supported by International Development Research Centre [grant number IDRC 107642]; Office of the Vice President for Research, University of South Carolina [grant number SPARC]; United States Agency for International Development [grant number Borlaug LEAP].",,80,5,5,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2018,23,9,,,,,934,951,,10.1080/13549839.2018.1505836,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,GR5PU,WOS:000442690200005,,,,,2021-08-07,

The analysis points to the risks of co-option that women's organisations face, trying to challenge and change the mainstream discourse on gender in climate policy-making. The need for diverse and flexible strategies for resistance and influence in order to seize opportunities that may arise in countering the depoliticising force of global climate governance are highlighted.","[Westholm, Lisa; Arora-Jonsson, Seema] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden","Westholm, L (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden.",lisa.westholm@gmail.com,"Arora-Jonsson, Seema/ABI-7290-2020","Arora-Jonsson, Seema/0000-0002-3841-0027",,,,65,7,7,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

The 'capacity of guidance' is an important feature of most normative theories, but ideal principles of justice are not well suited to guide action in non-ideal circumstances. This charge presses us to seek plausible avenues to connect ideal values with the non-ideal realisation of justice. The objective of this paper is to introduce an analytical framework and present a case study in support of what I call the 'reflective integration thesis'. The thesis states that: if we wish to formulate principles of justice that can guide action in non-ideal circumstances, we need to integrate ideal and non-ideal theory, and the way to integrate ideal and non-ideal theory is by seeking reflective equilibrium between these levels. Taking climate justice as a model, this paper will explore the features of a non-ideal theory of justice, thereby providing insights about the structure of an action-guiding theory. It will show that, in order to guide action, our ideal principles of climate justice need to be reformulated in the light of real-world considerations, which we only obtain by integrating the relevant empirical work on the matter.","[Sayegh, Alexandre Gajevic] UCL, Dept Philosophy, London, England","Sayegh, AG (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Philosophy, London, England.",a.sayegh.12@ucl.ac.uk,,,FRQSC; University College London,This work was supported by the FRQSC and University College London.,,39,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8230,1743-8772,,CRIT REV INT SOC POL,Crit.

A current debate in philosophy of economics concerns the role of storytelling in economic modelling, and a growing research programme in policy studies investigates the influence of stories on policy outcomes. These two streams of research have yet to be connected in an investigation of how scientific models, in addition to delivering numerical results, also shape policy through the stories that are told with them. This article addresses that gap, arguing that stories produced with integrated assessment models of global climate change are particular types of policy narratives. An analytical framework for studying their composition and content is suggested. The narrative analysis of modelled stories illuminates some of the models' underpinning values and beliefs. These values and beliefs influence the normative, policy-relevant conclusions generated with the models. For illustration, the framework is applied to the analysis of two variations of the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy model that are used to tell different stories about climate justice and climate policy.Key policy insights IAMs consist of mathematical structures and the stories told by manipulating these structures.There is an intricate but not fully deterministic relationship between IAM structures and stories.Examining both these elements contributes to our understanding of the models' role in climate governance.Appreciation of modelled stories may facilitate more effective use of IAMs in the policy process.","[Beck, Marisa] Univ Ottawa, Inst Sci Soc & Policy, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Beck, M (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Inst Sci Soc & Policy, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",mbeck2@uottawa.ca,,,Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship,This work was supported by a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship.,,54,3,3,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Using the oral histories of women (n = 10) involved in environmental and food justice projects from two separate Rocky Mountain West communities, I explore how gender interlocks with other identities (such as femininity, motherhood, and citizenship subjectivities) to mediate environmental realities, experiences of injustice, and claims for recognition. Within my analysis, I focus on how the congruence or contestation of local hegemonic identity norms may impact resource distribution to the organizations and communities these women work with. My findings suggest that the women, and organizations, who conform to hegemonic expectations face less relational, community, or political censure. I use these findings to argue that linking the performances (supportive and transgressive) of hegemonic femininity of food and environmental justice organizations and their members is an important conceptual approach needed to examine power relations; whether they have the potential to disrupt hegemonic norms and institutionalized social inequalities in communities, or conversely how these transgressions help to construct structural environmental inequalities.","[Larkins, Michelle L.] Pacific Univ, Ctr Sustainable Soc, Forest Grove, OR 97116 USA","Larkins, ML (corresponding author), Pacific Univ, Ctr Sustainable Soc, Forest Grove, OR 97116 USA.",michelle.larkins@pacificu.edu,,,"Gender, Justice, and Environmental Change Dissertation Fellowship, Michigan State University","This work was supported by the Gender, Justice, and Environmental Change Dissertation Fellowship, Michigan State University.",,61,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

First, we identify a rise of climate educators who promote climate reality and impacts, while neglecting the anthropogenic causes of climate change. Second, geophysical lessons are advanced, amid confounding coastal development. Third, professional interests are voiced, while population diversity, including migration histories and generational futures, go unrecognized as potential resources or concerns to broaden climate interest and action within and beyond the region.

However, how far such discussions involve thorough and inclusive debate on the energy and environmental-social justice issues associated with renewable energy siting remains ambiguous, particularly where government agendas prioritise renewable energy and planning systems offer limited opportunities for public debate on value-based arguments for and against renewable energy developments. Using the concept of justice self-recognition, we argue for greater attention to public discussion of the justice dimensions of renewable energy to assist in developing mechanisms to integrate distributive and procedural fairness principles into renewable energy decision-making. To explore how justice is currently invoked in such contexts, we examine recent U.K. policies for renewable energy and public submissions to applications for small-scale wind energy projects in Cornwall, U.K. The analysis of public comments revealed that justice concerns were rarely discussed explicitly. Comments instead did not raise concerns as justice issues or focused implicitly on distributive justice, stressing local aesthetic, community and economic impacts, clean energy and climate change. However, the findings indicated limited discussion of procedural or participatory justice, an absence that hampers the establishment of coherent procedures for deciding acceptable impacts, information standards, public participation and arbitrating disputes. We conclude by suggesting procedural reforms to policy and planning to enable greater public expression of justice concerns and debate on how to negotiate tensions between energy and environmental-social justice in renewable energy siting decisions.","[Bailey, Ian; Darkal, Hoayda] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England","Bailey, I (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England.",ian.bailey@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Bailey, Ian/0000-0002-6865-8306",,,,77,19,19,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2018,23,3,,,,,335,351,,10.1080/13549839.2017.1418848,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,GE4IX,WOS:000431180200005,,Green Submitted,,,2021-08-07,

The principal conclusions are that workers have the interest and collective capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to address the differential impacts of climate and climate policy, and to coalesce workers to tackle climate change. The recent experience of UK trade unions suggests they have a vital role to play as climate actors and, suitably reconfigured, the capability to renew their role in the twenty-first century.","[Hampton, Paul] Fire Brigades Union, Res & Policy, London, England","Hampton, P (corresponding author), Fire Brigades Union, Res & Policy, London, England.",paul.hampton@fbu.org.uk,,,,,,46,11,11,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-7731,1474-774X,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,,2018,15,4,,,SI,,470,486,,10.1080/14747731.2018.1454673,,,17,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GD4VO,WOS:000430500900003,,Bronze,,,2021-08-07,

Men show gender matching tendencies, being more likely to select (Study 2) and positively evaluate (Study 3) arguments related to science and business than ethics and environmental justice. Men also tend to attribute negative feminine traits to other men who use ethics and environmental justice arguments, which mediates the relation between type of argument and men's evaluation of the argument (Study 3).

Reflective supervision is essential to counter the perceived negative impacts of managerialism on CCW work. Within this environment, there is a struggle to ensure supervision provides reflective spaces for social workers to develop in their work with service users despite the demands of meeting organisational imperatives. This article reports on a qualitative study which critically analyses the espoused theory and theories-in-use [Argyris, C., & Schon, D. (1974). Theory in practice: Increasing professional effectiveness. San Francisco, CA: Jossey Bass.] about reflective supervision held by social workers practising in the demanding environment of CCW. In the first phase of the research reported here, nine key informants who had both considerable experience in CCW and academic experience in ANZ were interviewed about the nature of reflective supervision in CCW social work. Findings indicate that social workers working in CCW settings are influenced by factors associated with self-awareness, relationships, organisational and professional obligations within a changing and risk-averse managerial environment. Key informants assert that social workers from CCW backgrounds need reflective supervision to engage in self-reflection, consider wider socio-cultural factors and to critically develop social-justice-informed practice with service users.","[Rankine, Matt; Beddoe, Liz; O'Brien, Mike; Fouche, Christa] Univ Auckland, Sch Counselling Human Serv & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand","Rankine, M (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Counselling Human Serv & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand.",m.rankine@auckland.ac.nz,,"Fouche, Christa/0000-0002-1427-9773",,,,38,8,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-1457,1468-2664,,EUR J SOC WORK,Eur.

We sought to challenge a nationalist version of citizenship education by proposing education for cosmopolitan citizenship arguing for citizenship learning founded in human rights, that recognises and builds upon cosmopolitan values at all scales. Building upon David Held's theories of cosmopolitan democracy we examined research data from young people living in communities characterised by diversity. We characterised them as emergent cosmopolitan citizens, who were negotiating daily their multiple loyalties and belongings. Nearly two decades later, many people are less optimistic about the global political climate. In the face of economic difficulties, demographic change and uncertainties, some welcome authoritarian and populist leaders whose rhetoric suggests easy solutions to complex problems, blaming the most vulnerable (e.g. refugees, foreigners) for society's ills. A politics of solidarity and hope is derided as those who have suffered the negative impact of globalisation, economic crisis and austerity policies are urged to put our people first. This paper examines various challenges confronting teachers who seek to educate young people for living together in democratic communities in which human rights, justice and peace prevail. We argue that education for human rights and cosmopolitan citizenship is more urgent than ever. Such an education can offer young people alternative narratives, empowering them to struggle for justice in their own lives and those of others.","[Osler, Audrey] Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Fac Humanities Sports & Educ Sci, Drammen, Norway; [Osler, Audrey] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Starkey, Hugh] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England","Osler, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Fac Humanities Sports & Educ Sci, Drammen, Norway.; Osler, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.h.osler@leeds.ac.uk,"Starkey, Hugh/AAD-2761-2020","Starkey, Hugh/0000-0002-6260-8711",,,,31,19,19,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1911,1465-3397,,EDUC REV,Educ.

To do this we consider the state as a continued terrain of possibility for positive social, economic and environmental change, noting the imperative of historically attentive state-enabled redistribution along persistent axes of difference. In articulating an alternative understanding of the state, we emphasise the importance of social movements capable of cultivating networked militant particularisms that can be channeled through and beyond state governance processes.

It is proving an attractive concept to both academics and practitioners. However, the social justice implications of CCD have not yet been comprehensively explored and an absence of adequate evaluation frameworks has led to multiple, legitimate cross-scalar social justice claims being marginalised. This article develops a framework to guide holistic social justice evaluation of CCD initiatives across levels and scales. Underpinning this framework is a social justice approach that embraces particularism, pluralism and procedural justice. Drawing on existing research, the framework is used to explore the implications of the Clean Development Mechanism for recognition, participation and distribution in the Least Developed Countries. Findings show that achieving social justice through CCD is not a given; rather, the social justice implications of CCD differ within and between levels and scales. We conclude by suggesting ways in which our framework can be applied to augment knowledge on CCD. Understanding the processes through which social justices and injustices are created is integral to considerations of whether and how CCD should be used to underpin a new development landscape.","[Wood, Benjamin T.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Quinn, Claire H.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Wood, BT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bw@xynteo.com; l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; c.h.quinn@leeds.ac.uk,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228","Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (University of Leeds, UK) [ES/K006576/1]; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish","The authors are grateful for funding support from the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (University of Leeds, UK) (Grant number: ES/K006576/1).",,123,5,5,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2018,10,1,,,,,,,211,10.3390/su10010211,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW1TN,WOS:000425082600208,,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

On the basis of this theme, this paper aims to propose a method for undertaking the responsibility for climate refugees literally uprooted by liable climate polluting countries. It also considers the historical past, culture, geopolitics, imposed wars, economic oppression and fragile governance to understand the holistic scenario of vulnerability to climate change. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is organized around three distinct aspects of dealing with extreme climatic events-vulnerability as part of making the preparedness and response process fragile (past), climate change as a hazard driver (present) and rehabilitating the climate refugees (future). Bangladesh is used as an example that represents a top victim country to climatic extreme events from many countries with similar baseline characteristics. The top 20 countries accounting for approximately 82 per cent of the total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are considered for model development by analysing the parameters-per capita CO2 emissions, ecological footprint, gross national income and human development index. Findings - Results suggest that under present circumstances, Australia and the USA each should take responsibility of 10 per cent each of the overall global share of climate refugees, followed by Canada and Saudi Arabia (9 per cent each), South Korea (7 per cent) and Russia, Germany and Japan (6 per cent each). As there is no international convention for protecting climate refugees yet, the victims either end up in detention camps or are refused shelter in safer places or countries. There is a dire need to address the climate refugee crisis as these people face greater political risks. Originality/value - This paper provides a critical overview of accommodating the climate refugees (those who have no means for bouncing back) by the liable countries. It proposes an innovative method by considering the status of climate pollution, resource consumption, economy and human development rankings to address the problem by bringing humanitarian justice to the ultimate climate refugees.","[Ahmed, Bayes] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, Dept Earth Sci, London, England; [Ahmed, Bayes] Univ Dhaka, Fac Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Disaster Sci & Management, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Ahmed, B (corresponding author), UCL, Humanitarian Inst, London, England.",bayesahmed@gmail.com,"Ahmed, Bayes/G-6913-2013","Ahmed, Bayes/0000-0001-5092-5528",UK Government,"Bayes Ahmed is a Commonwealth Scholar funded by the UK Government.

When Sir Walter Scott penned these words, he probably did not have diversity or universities on his mind. Those of us that are genuinely engaged in diversity, inclusion, equity, social justice, and/or multicultural education work can ruminate on his words and think of how university campuses tout their diversity initiatives and sometimes brag about being the most diverse are in actuality deceiving themselves and the constituents they serve. Even though diversity awareness has become an important topic in academe in recent years, so many campuses have largely failed to address it in any substantive way, thus creating an environment where students and even employees sometimes become disengaged. Davies (2007) argues that university leaders who claim openness to diversity do not acknowledge the presence or participation of Others in activities that are characteristic of a free and democratic society (p. 154). Many institutions of higher learning honestly believe that in showcasing a campus program based around food, festival, or fun, they can check the diversity box. Yet, when diversity practitioners push the campus in becoming multicultural competent by addressing diversity outside the proverbial realm of race, questions like, Why are they doing this? arise. The struggle to sustain a comprehensive and meaningful campus diversity program is real for many agents for change. In order for diversity advocates to have a seat at the table, the campus attitude and practice of diversity need not apply cannot continue to exist. Leaders within academia must be cognizant of their campus culture, which governs the law of the land. More importantly, it is vital to understand that sometimes your campus culture may not be receptive to cultural differences, although university verbiage may state, We will promote diversity and maintain an environment that celebrates and values the many perspectives, cultures, and [...] Institutions of higher learning in this new millennium (twenty-first century) are deeply entrenched in organizational culture that has become its cornerstone over time, and is resistant to change. Campus culture is real. Stewart and Dottolo (2005) state that universities should strive to ensure that any groups that fall outside of the traditional culture do not encounter an unwelcoming and threatening institutional environment. However, not every university strives or desires to create a campus climate where diversity is welcomed, celebrated, and/or embraced. It is paramount that educational institutions that serve diverse populations strive to become proficient in multiculturalism (Roach, 2004). Institutions of higher education are socially obligated to provide a learning environment for students with varied backgrounds (Bridges et al., 2008). It is essential that universities take a very close look at how they can contribute to the greater good of society by instilling a sense of worth in all students, regardless of ethnicity and other features of student identities. Williams and Swail (2005) argue that attending college can be a liberating, developmentally powerful experience with the potential to increase individual productivity and, to some degree, the quality of life of the larger society (p. 222). This can only occur if or when all aspects of diversity can apply and become an integral part of the university.","[Canida, Robert L., II] Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA","Canida, RL (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA.",,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1479-3644,,978-1-78714-805-5; 978-1-78714-806-2,DIVERS HIGH EDUC,,,2018,20,,,,,,95,104,,10.1108/S1479-364420180000020007,,,10,Education & Educational Research; Ethnic Studies; Social Issues,Education & Educational Research; Ethnic Studies; Social Issues,BP8JR,WOS:000565823700008,,,,,2021-08-07,

The concept provides important opportunities to help examine how rapid and fundamental change to address contemporary global challenges can be facilitated. This paper contributes to discussions about transformation by providing a social science, arts and humanities perspective to open up discussion and set out a research agenda about what it means to transform and the dimensions, limitations and possibilities for transformation. Key focal areas include: (1) change theories; (2) knowing whether transformation has occurred or is occurring; (3) knowledge production and use; (4) governance; (5) how dimensions of social justice inform transformation; (6) the limits of human nature; (7) the role of the utopian impulse; (8) working with the present to create new futures; and (9) human consciousness. In addition to presenting a set of research questions around these themes the paper highlights that much deeper engagement with complex social processes is required; that there are vast opportunities for social science, humanities and the arts to engage more directly with the climate challenge; that there is a need for a massive upscaling of efforts to understand and shape desired forms of change; and that, in addition to helping answer important questions about how to facilitate change, a key role of the social sciences, humanities and the arts in addressing climate change is to critique current societal patterns and to open up new thinking. Through such critique and by being more explicit about what is meant by transformation, greater opportunities will be provided for opening up a dialogue about change, possible futures and about what it means to re-shape the way in which people live.","[Fazey, Ioan; Moug, Peter; Holm, Lorens; Lyon, Christopher; Moss, Anna; Rao-Williams, Jennifer] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Environm Change & Human Resilience, Dundee, Scotland; [Allen, Simon] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Beckmann, Kate] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Built Environm, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Blackwood, David; Falconer, Ruth] Abertay Univ, Sch Sci Engn & Technol, Dundee, Scotland; [Bonaventura, Mike] Crichton Carbon Ctr, Dumfries, Scotland; [Burnett, Kathryn] Univ West Scotland, Sch Media Culture & Soc, Ayr, Scotland; [Danson, Mike] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Business Management, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gagnon, Alexandre S.] Univ West Scotland, Sch Sci & Sport, Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland; [Harkness, Rachel] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Hodgson, Anthony] Univ Hull, Ctr Syst Studies, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Hodgson, Anthony] Int Futures Forum, Aberdour, Scotland; [Irvine, Katherine N.] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Low, Ragne] ClimateXChange, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Moran, Clare] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Sci & Policy, Cambridge, England; [Naylor, Larissa] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Brien, Karen] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Oslo, Norway; [Russell, Shona] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Skerratt, Sarah] Scotlands Rural Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wolstenholme, Ruth] Sniffer, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Fazey, I (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Environm Change & Human Resilience, Dundee, Scotland.",i.fazey@dundee.ac.uk,"Lyon, Christopher/T-9426-2019; Gagnon, Alexandre/AAB-6465-2020; Naylor, Larissa/E-7301-2014","Moug, Peter/0000-0002-5156-8865; Holm, Lorens/0000-0003-0615-6404; Naylor, Larissa/0000-0002-4065-2674; Burnett, Kathryn A./0000-0001-7329-6699; Lyon, Christopher/0000-0003-2319-2933; Russell, Shona/0000-0002-3473-5019; Gagnon, Alexandre/0000-0002-1301-6015",,,,187,73,73,4,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The WIM aims at advancing knowledge gathering, coordination and support to address L&D associated with extreme and slow onset events in vulnerable developing countries (Decision 2/CP.19). Despite being among the most controversial issues to be recently treated in climate change negotiation, L&D has attracted little attention in the field of international relations. This paper aims at addressing this gap by reconstructing the emergence and evolution of the negotiating positions on L&D of developing and developed countries. It employs a critical discourse analytical approach and builds on Fairclough's three-dimensional framework for critical discourse analysis, taking decision 2/CP.19 as the core communicative event. Consistently, the decision is analysed at three different levels: as a text (micro-scale); as a discursive practice (meso-scale); and as a social practice (macro-scale). The analysis makes use of a wide range of materials including previous decisions, High Level Segment statements and Parties submissions. It reconstructs Parties' conflicting views on the positioning of L&D vis-a-vis the adaptation space (L&D as a part of, or as beyond adaptation) and the scientific, ethical and legal arguments employed to support these standpoints. It highlights, in particular, the strategic importance which the compensation argument' had in determining developing countries' capacity to influence the UNFCCC process up to the inclusion of a specific article on L&D in the Paris Agreement. While calls for compensation might have lost momentum as a result of the Warsaw and Paris talks, the paper argues that their potential is far from exhausted. They in fact imply a more general request for climate justice which the UNFCCC has not yet addressed.","[Calliari, Elisa] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Euromediterranean Ctr, Venice, Italy; [Calliari, Elisa] Ca Foscari Univ, Venice, Italy; [Calliari, Elisa] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria","Calliari, E (corresponding author), Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Euromediterranean Ctr, Venice, Italy.; Calliari, E (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Venice, Italy.; Calliari, E (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",elisa.calliari@feem.it,"Calliari, Elisa/G-4082-2016","Calliari, Elisa/0000-0002-8075-558X",European Union under the CASCADE Action [FED/2011/281-147]; ENHANCE project (Enhancing risk management partnerships for catastrophic natural disasters in Europe) [308438],"This work was supported by the European Union under the CASCADE Action (Climate change adaptation strategies for water resources and human livelihoods in the coastal zones of Small Island Developing States [grant contract id number FED/2011/281-147]) implemented by the ACP Caribbean & Pacific Research Programme for Sustainable Development, 10th European Development Fund, and under the Seventh Framework Program [FP7/2007-2013] ENHANCE project (Enhancing risk management partnerships for catastrophic natural disasters in Europe [grant agreement 308438]).",,84,16,16,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

Yet in developed countries in the context of renewable energy infrastructure deployment, place attachment, place identity and place-protective action continue to be implicated in public objection. We set out an interdisciplinary change readiness hypothesis of specifically how local participatory scenario or visioning processes that include climate mitigation measures may support the mobilisation of place attachment for climate mitigation, including renewable energy deployment. We hypothesise that local visioning may support movement towards change readiness by helping to anchor unfamiliar social representations of low carbon energy infrastructure and new patterns of urban form in existing, more positive representations of localities and associated attachments. To this end, seeking ways to modify threat perceptions relating to climate change and renewable energy infrastructure is advocated as a key direction for study.","[Upham, Paul; Boegel, Paula Maria] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Environm & Sustainabil Commun INFU, Luneburg, Germany; [Johansen, Katinka] DTU, Lyngby, Denmark; [Johansen, Katinka] HOFOR, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Axon, Stephen] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Garard, Jennifer] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Carney, Sebastian] Carbon Captured Ltd, Manchester, Lancs, England","Upham, P (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Environm & Sustainabil Commun INFU, Luneburg, Germany.",paul.upham@leuphana.de,"Upham, Paul/AAA-5410-2021","Upham, Paul/0000-0003-1998-4698; Garard, Jennifer/0000-0001-8746-9992; Axon, Stephen/0000-0003-1166-6118; Bogel, Paula Maria/0000-0003-0834-6092; Johansen, Katinka/0000-0001-5404-9772",,,,53,6,6,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2018,23,9,,,,,912,919,,10.1080/13549839.2018.1488824,,,8,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,GR5PU,WOS:000442690200003,,Green Submitted,,,2021-08-07,

These shifts affect alliances, collaboration and conflict among and between state and social forces, as well as within and between movements and societies. The actual implications and mechanisms by which these changes are happening are empirical questions that need careful investigation. The bulk of our discussion is dedicated to the issue of responses to the crises both by capitalist forces and those adversely affected by the crises, and the implications of these for academic research and political activist work. More specifically, we explore four thematic clusters, namely (1) class and intersectionality; (2) sectoral and multisectoral issues and concerns; (3) importance of immediate, tactical and concrete issues of working people; and (4) links between national and global institutional spaces and political processes. We know only a little about the questions we framed here, but it is just enough to give us the confidence to argue that these questions are areas of inquiry that deserve closer attention in terms of both academic research and political debates and actions.","[Borras, Saturnino M., Jr.; Moreda, Tsegaye; Alonso-Fradejas, Alberto; Brent, Zoe W.] ISS, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands","Borras, SM (corresponding author), ISS, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.",borras@iss.nl,,,NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); IDRC; European UnionEuropean Commission; Agrarian and Environmental Justice (AEJ) programme of TNI,"The individual contributions and the collection as a whole benefitted from the support our contributors received from various initiatives and projects, and we would like to acknowledge some of these here: the Mosaic project funded by NWO (2014-2018) on the intersection of land grabbing, climate change mitigation and conflict in Cambodia and Myanmar; the IDRC-funded social movement-driven action research in Uganda, Mali, Nigeria and South Africa (2015-2017) coordinated by FIAN-International, PLAAS and the Transnational Institute (TNI), and its spin-off action research in Mali and Nigeria (2018-2020) on climate change, land rush and intersectionality; the Heinrich Boell Foundation, specifically its Fairtrade project funded by the European Union (2014-2016); and various means of support from the Agrarian and Environmental Justice (AEJ) programme of TNI.",,84,14,14,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-6597,1360-2241,,THIRD WORLD Q,Third World Q.,,2018,39,7,,,SI,,1227,1246,,10.1080/01436597.2018.1491301,,,20,Development Studies,Development Studies,HF4RU,WOS:000454221800001,,Bronze,,,2021-08-07,

This article argues that Trump's decision opens 4 pathways by which these harms might be transmitted in the coming years: (1) by prolonging the viability of U.S. fossil fuel development; (2) by prolonging a period of slow and unambitious global climate action; (3) by extending to climate efforts a worldview that will open future climate policy up to reactionary resistance; and (4) by rescinding funding for adaptation projects in vulnerable communities.","[Saad, Aaron] York Univ, Environm Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada","Saad, A (corresponding author), York Univ, Environm Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",aaronsaad@gmail.com,,,,,,29,6,6,0,3,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Decisions on whom to protect often caused contradicting concepts of political understanding, which differ in interpretations of fair resource allocation and distribution. This paper analyses the impact of different philosophical schools of social justice on mountain hazard management in Austria. We used data from a spatially explicit, object-based assessment of elements at risk and compared potential distributional effects of three political jurisdictions. We found that-depending on the respective political direction-various local governments gain and others loose within the actual distributional system of mitigation strategies. The implementation of a utilitarian policy approach would cause that high income communities in hazard-prone areas would mainly benefit. Consequently, this policy direction would encourage the public administration to ignore their own failure in the past natural hazards management and prevention. On the other hand, following a Rawlsians approach mainly peripheral communities would gain from new policy direction who often show besides natural hazards problem mainly large socio-economic challenges. Finally, the most radical change would include the implementation of a liberalism policy, whereabouts the state only provides hazard information, but no further mitigation measures. These findings highlight the distributional consequences of future mountain hazard management strategies and point to the crucial selection of policy direction in navigating the selection of various adaptation schemes.","[Thaler, Thomas; Fuchs, Sven] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Zischg, Andreas; Keiler, Margreth] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Mobiliar Lab Nat Risks, Bern, Switzerland; [Zischg, Andreas] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Keiler, Margreth] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland","Thaler, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria.",thomas.thaler@boku.ac.at,"Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014; Keiler, Margreth/F-4258-2012; Fuchs, Sven/F-4208-2012; Zischg, Andreas Paul/G-3382-2014","Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722; Keiler, Margreth/0000-0001-9168-023X; Fuchs, Sven/0000-0002-0644-2876; Zischg, Andreas Paul/0000-0002-4749-7670",University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU); Austrian Climate and Energy Fund project SHARED [KR16AC0K13268],"Open access funding provided by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU).

Few studies have investigated the influence of hazard experience, geophysical vulnerability (hazard proximity), and risk perceptions in cities undergoing postdisaster recovery and rebuilding. We use ordinal logistic regression techniques to analyze experiential, geophysical, and sociodemographic variables derived from a survey of 384 residents in seven neighborhoods. We find that residents living in neighborhoods that flooded during Hurricane Katrina exhibit higher levels of perceived risk than those residents living in neighborhoods that did not flood. In addition, findings suggest that flood risk perception is positively associated with female gender, lower income, and direct flood experiences. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical and empirical research on environmental risk, flood risk communication strategies, and flood hazards planning.","[Gotham, Kevin Fox] Tulane Univ, Dept Sociol, 215 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Campanella, Richard] Tulane Univ, Sch Architecture, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Lauve-Moon, Katie] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Social Work, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Powers, Bradford] Tulane Univ, City Culture & Community, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Gotham, KF (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Sociol, 215 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",kgotham@tulane.edu,"Gotham, Kevin Fox/X-8783-2019",,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CNH-1313703],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant CNH-1313703.

One site critically affected is the Murray-Darling Basin area of Australia, an area known as the food bowl of Australia. Following a lengthy drought at the turn of the century concerns were raised about water quality and river health. This led successive governments to introduce policies to systematically reduce water available for irrigated agriculture. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was developed by the Commonwealth government and is designed to secure water savings from irrigators and to direct those water savings to the stressed natural environment. This paper focuses on the impact of these changes on irrigation dairy families and their communities in northern Victoria. Using a model designed to test the limits to adaptation, we draw out the constraints, limits and barriers to adaptation for dairy families and their communities coping with reduced water access. This model highlights the types of socially just and fair interventions necessary to assist adaptation and foctises attention on thresholds and traps that may prevent adaptation. The model is relevant to other areas where climate changes and environmental disasters are shaping inevitable change.","[Alston, Margaret; Clarke, Josephine; Whittenbury, Kerri] Monash Univ, Dept Social Work, Gender Leadership & Social Sustainabil GLASS Res, Caulfield Campus,Dandenong Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia","Alston, M (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Social Work, Gender Leadership & Social Sustainabil GLASS Res, Caulfield Campus,Dandenong Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia.",Margaret.alston@monash.edu; Josephine.Clarke@monash.edu; Kerri.whittenbury@monash.edu,,"Alston, Margaret/0000-0001-9057-7767","Australian Research Council (ARC linkage grant)Australian Research Council [LP130100676]; Geoffrey Gardiner Dairy Foundation, Melbourne","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC linkage grant number LP130100676); and the Geoffrey Gardiner Dairy Foundation, Melbourne.",,55,5,5,2,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,,,J RURAL STUD,J.

Scientific expertise is commonly seen as providing important means to overcome this tension, for example in the Agreement's global stocktake, which is said to be undertaken in the light of equity and the best available science. This raises the question of how scholarly communities best can contribute to deliberations on equitable differentiation in the effort required to meet common temperature goals. To discuss this question, the paper looks to the literature within Science and Technology Studies on the role of science in policymaking, where disagreement exists over the merits of heating up controversies through politicization, versus cooling down issues by seeking consensus. It assesses two cases in which scientific expertise has engaged with questions of equitable effort-sharing in international climate politics: The Bali Box of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, and the Civil Society Equity Review undertaken prior to COP21 in Paris. Based on a comparison of the two cases, it is argued that scientific contributions should not shy away from highlighting conflicts in values and interests, and that heating up discussions about climate justice may be a valuable contribution to overcoming the tensions of the Paris Agreement.","[Lahn, Bard] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway","Lahn, B (corresponding author), CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",bard.lahn@cicero.oslo.no,"Lahn, Bard/AAJ-6936-2021","Lahn, Bard/0000-0001-9161-9455",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [209701],"The author would like to thank Goran Sundqvist, the editors, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

These challenges are likely to aggravate issues of justice in flood risk management (hereafter FRM). Based on a discursive institutionalist perspective, this paper explores justice in Dutch FRM: how do institutions allocate the responsibilities and costs for FRM for different types of flooding? What are the underlying conceptions of justice? What are the future challenges with regard to climate change? The research revealed that a dichotomy is visible in the Dutch approach to FRM: despite an abundance of rules, regulations and resources spent, flood risk or its management is only marginally discussed in terms of justice. Despite that, the current institutional arrangement has material outcomes that treat particular groups of citizens differently, depending on the type of flooding they are prone to, area they live in (unembanked/embanked) or category of user (e.g. household, industry, farmer). The paper argues that the debate on justice will (re)emerge, since the differences in distributional outcomes are likely to become increasingly uneven as a result of increasing flood risk. The Netherlands should be prepared for this debate by generating the relevant facts and figures. An inclusive debate on the distribution of burdens of FRM could contribute to more effective and legitimate FRM.","[Kaufmann, Maria; Leroy, Pieter] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Thomas van Aquinostr,POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Priest, Sally J.] Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, London, England","Kaufmann, M (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Thomas van Aquinostr,POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",m.kaufmann@fm.ru.nl; S.Priest@mdx.ac.uk; p.leroy@fm.ru.nl,,,European UnionEuropean Commission [308364],This research was supported by the European Union's Seventh Framework through the grant to the budget STAR-FLOOD (Contract 308364) as well as the grant agreement for 'Erasmus + staff mobility for teaching and training'.

In doing so, new indices of neighbourhood flood vulnerability and social flood risk are introduced and used to provide a quantitative comparison of the flood risks faced by more and less socially vulnerable neighbourhoods. The results show the concentrated nature of geographic flood disadvantage. For example, ten local authorities account for 50% of the most socially vulnerable people that live in flood prone areas. The results also highlight the systematic nature of flood disadvantage. For example, flood risks are higher in socially vulnerable communities than elsewhere; this is shown to be particularly the case in coastal areas, economically struggling cities, and dispersed rural communities. Results from a re-analysis of the Environment Agency's Long-Term Investment Scenarios (for England) suggest a long-term economic case for improving the protection afforded to the most socially vulnerable communities; a finding that reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of flood risk in socially vulnerable communities if flood risk management efforts are to deliver fair outcomes. In response to these findings, the paper advocates an approach to flood risk management that emphasises Rawlsian principles of preferentially targeting risk reduction for the most socially vulnerable and avoids a process of prioritisation based upon strict utilitarian or purely egalitarian principles.","[Sayers, Paul] Sayers & Partners, Watlington, England; [Penning-Rowsell, Edmund C.] Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, London NW4 4BT, England; [Horritt, Matt] Horritt Consulting, Ross On Wye, England","Penning-Rowsell, EC (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, London NW4 4BT, England.",paul.sayers@sayersandpartners.co.uk; Edmund@penningrowsell.com; matt@horrittconsulting.co.uk,,"Sayers, Paul/0000-0003-2160-1959",Joseph Rowntree Foundation,The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding provided by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (Katharine Knox) through their support of our research into flood resilience in disadvantaged communities (Sayers et al. 2017) that forms the basis of this paper.

Investigating the perception of benefits and losses / costs delivered by a specific service providing unit (SPU) can generate objective orientations suitable for urban planning and management deeply embedded in the social-ecological systems where they occur, because the realization of ES into benefits and losses / costs is mediated by specific beneficiaries and reflects their characteristics, information and use of ecosystems. Street trees are a particularly relevant SPU in many densely built Southern-European cities due to the difficulty in implementing new sizeable green areas. In this study, a questionnaire was developed and applied in Porto to investigate how benefits (cultural, regulating and economic) and losses / costs caused by street trees are perceived by citizens and influenced by a set of socioeconomic variables (N = 819 people aged 18 years or older), and parametric statistical tests were used to analyze the effect of gender, age and school level. Results evidenced that people in Porto valued more environmental benefits (particularly air quality improvement) than cultural ones. School level was the variable accounting for more differences, underlining a tendency in people with lower level of academic education to value less the benefits provided by street trees in Porto and attribute more importance to losses and damages, compared to people who attended university or had higher academic degree. Age also held considerable differences in mean responses, with older people showing more concern towards losses and costs, while gender influenced perception of cultural benefits, which were more important for women than for men. The findings of the research are discussed concerning implications for environmental justice, planning and management of urban ecosystems.","[Graca, Marisa; Farinha-Marques, Paulo] Univ Porto, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Graca, Marisa; Farinha-Marques, Paulo; Cunha, Mario] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Rua Campo Alegre S-N, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Queiros, Cristina] Univ Porto, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Psychol, Rua Alfredo Allen, P-4200135 Porto, Portugal; [Cunha, Mario] Univ Porto, Inst Syst & Comp Engn Technol & Sci INESC TEC, CRIIS, Campus Fac Engn,Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal","Graca, M (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",graca.marisa@fc.up.pt; cqueiros@fpce.up.pt; pfmarque@fc.up.pt; mccunha@fc.up.pt,"Queiros, Cristina/K-7255-2019","Queiros, Cristina/0000-0002-8045-5317; Cunha, Mario/0000-0002-8299-324X; /0000-0003-4454-7553; Graca, Marisa/0000-0002-2231-8752",Portuguese Agency for Science and Technology (FCT) - Ministry for Science and Education [SFRH/BD/91028/2012]; European Social Fund through POPH - QREN - Tipology 4.1 - Advanced Training,"This research was partially funded by the Portuguese Agency for Science and Technology (FCT) through PhD grant of M.

The negotiation of global climate change agreements, including the Paris Agreement and the recent Global Environmental Pact, is increasingly engaged with critical intersections between climate change and human rights. The broader concept of 'benefit-sharing', as a means of providing defined content to human rights claims, is now central to rights discourses in this context. In international agreements, however, notions of 'benefits' and 'sharing' presently lack the critical definition, detail and specificity necessary to facilitate the realization of human rights for Indigenous and local communities. The rearticulation of rights as 'benefits' to be 'shared', moreover, risks the commodification of a previously moral imperative, subordinating human rights aspirations to global political and corporate agendas, as well as to national interests. This article provides a critical examination of the concept of 'benefit-sharing', its manifestation in REDD+ and other international regimes as a putative tool for the pursuit of climate justice, and its utility for Indigenous and local communities in the pursuit of robust rights protections.","[Birrell, Kathleen; Godden, Lee] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Godden, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,"Birrell, Kathleen/0000-0002-1603-6097",Australian Research Council Discovery ProjectAustralian Research Council [DP110100259],The authors acknowledge the financial support received from the Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP110100259) and that this work emerged from that broader collaborative project.

While acknowledging the importance of extending environmental justice to include these other dimensions of justice, this paper argues that more, not less, analytical attention needs to be devoted to the diverse logics of distribution of environmental risks. In light of continuing dilemmas associated with whether environmental inequalities can be just or, alternatively, that environmental inequality and injustice are co-extensive, this paper proposes to untangle some key connections between environmental inequalities and injustice through a critical confrontation of environmental justice with risk-class analysis.

Yet such transformations are not always viewed as politically feasible; finding ways to enhance the political feasibility of ambitious decarbonization trajectories is needed. This paper reviews the role of social justice as an organizing principle for politically feasible 1.5 degrees C transformations. A social justice lens usefully focuses attention on first, protecting vulnerable people from climate change impacts, second, protecting people from disruptions of transformation, and finally, enhancing the process of envisioning and implementing an equitable post-carbon society. However, justice-focused arguments could also have unintended consequences, such as being deployed against climate action. Hence proactively engaging with social justice is critical in navigating 1.5 degrees C societal transformations.","[Patterson, James J.; Oels, Angela; Huitema, Dave] Netherlands Open Univ, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Patterson, James J.; Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Thaler, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Hoffmann, Matthew; Hughes, Sara] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chu, Eric] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Mert, Aysem] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Burch, Sarah] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Jordan, Andy] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England","Patterson, JJ (corresponding author), Netherlands Open Univ, Heerlen, Netherlands.; Patterson, JJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",james.patterson@ou.nl,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015; Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014; Huitema, Dave/L-1343-2013","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722; Hughes, Sara/0000-0002-1282-6235; Huitema, Dave/0000-0001-8565-3200; Jordan, Andrew/0000-0001-7678-1024",European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [659065]; Netherlands Open University; INOGOV network (EU COST Action) [IS1309],"We would like to acknowledge the INOGOV network (EU COST Action: IS1309) which nearly all of the authors of this paper are part of.

Exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, heat events are expected to become more intense and frequent as climate change progresses, though we have limited understanding of the impact of such events on vulnerable populations at a neighborhood or census block group level. Focusing on the City of Portland, Oregon, this study aimed to determine which socio-demographic populations experience disproportionate exposure to extreme heat, as well as the level of access to refuge in the form of public cooling centers or residential central air conditioning. During a 2014 heat wave, temperature data were recorded using a vehicle-traverse collection method, then extrapolated to determine average temperature at the census block group level. Socio-demographic factors including income, race, education, age, and English speaking ability were tested using statistical assessments to identify significant relationships with heat exposure and access to refuge from extreme heat. Results indicate that groups with limited adaptive capacity, including those in poverty and non-white populations, are at higher risk for heat exposure, suggesting an emerging concern of environmental justice as it relates to climate change. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusion, in combination with effectively distributing cooling centers in areas where the greatest burden befalls vulnerable populations.","[Voelkel, Jackson; Hellman, Dana; Shandas, Vivek] Portland State Univ, Sch Urban Studies & Planning, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Sakuma, Ryu] Peace Winds Japan, Tokyo 1510063, Japan","Shandas, V (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Sch Urban Studies & Planning, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",jvoelkel@pdx.edu; dhellman@pdx.edu; lyu.sakuma@gmail.com; vshandas@pdx.edu,,"Hellman, Dana/0000-0002-3798-0693; Voelkel, Jackson/0000-0002-2263-5635","Institute for Sustainable Solutions; National Science Foundation's Sustainable Research Network [1444755]; U.S. Forest Service's National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge Grants Program [17-DG-11132544-014]; Portland State University; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic ScieNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1444755] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was made possible with support from the Institute for Sustainable Solutions; the National Science Foundation's Sustainable Research Network Grant (No. 1444755); and the U.S. Forest Service's National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge Grants Program (No. 17-DG-11132544-014).

Furthermore, through the development of indicators associated with each goal and sub-goal, the SDGs support the notion of monitoring, evaluation and adaptive management, underpinned by the aspirations of social justice, equity and transparency. As such, the ethical intention of the SDGs is well founded. However, possible conflicts and trade-offs between individual SDGs have received little attention. For example, SDGs relating to poverty (SDG 1), inequality (SDG 10), food security (SDG2), economic development (SDG 8) and life in water and on land (SDGs 14 and 15), are potentially competing in many circumstances. In a social-ecological context, policy support and formulation are increasingly adopting systems approaches, which analyse the complex interactions of system elements. Adopting such an approach in this work, the above SDGs are analysed for coastal Bangladesh. This demonstrates multiple potential trade-offs between the SDGs, including agricultural farming approaches in the light of poverty reduction, and between economic growth and environmental integrity as well as equity. To develop coherent and policy relevant socio-ecological strategies, appropriate decision frameworks need to be co-developed across the range of stakeholders and decision-makers. Integrated models have great potential to support such a process.","[Hutton, Craig W.] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm Acad Unit, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Nicholls, Robert J.; Lazar, Attila N.; Chapman, Alex; Schaafsma, Marije] Univ Southampton, Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Salehin, Mashfiqus] BUET, Inst Water & Flood Management, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh","Hutton, CW (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm Acad Unit, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",ch9@soton.ac.uk; r.j.nicholls@soton.ac.uk; a.lazar@soton.ac.uk; adg506@gmail.com; m.schaafsma@soton.ac.uk; mashfiqussalehim@iwfm.buet.ac.bd,"Schaafsma, Marije/P-7795-2019; Nicholls, Robert J/G-3898-2010; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Schaafsma, Marije/M-8096-2013; Lazar, Attila/D-4277-2017","Schaafsma, Marije/0000-0003-0878-069X; Nicholls, Robert J/0000-0002-9715-1109; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Lazar, Attila/0000-0003-2033-2013; Hutton, Craig/0000-0002-5896-756X",Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE-J002755-1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),"This work Assessing Health, Livelihoods, Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation in Populous Deltas' (NE-J002755-1) was funded with support from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme.

This study used conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques from environmental health and inequality literature to address the limitations of CalEnviroScreen, especially its inattention to race-based environmental health vulnerabilities. It developed an adjusted measure of cumulative pollution burden from the CalEnviroScreen 2.0 data that facilitates multivariate analyses of the effect of neighborhood racial composition on cumulative pollution burden, net of other indicators of population vulnerability, traffic density, industrial zoning, and local and regional clustering of pollution burden. Principal component analyses produced three new measures of population vulnerability, including Latina /o cumulative disadvantage that represents the spatial concentration of Latinas/os, economic disadvantage, limited English-speaking ability, and health vulnerability. Spatial error regression analyses demonstrated that concentrations of Latinas/os, followed by Latina /o cumulative disadvantage, are the strongest demographic determinants of adjusted cumulative pollution burden.

J,"Purdy, J",,,,"Purdy, Jedediah",,,The Long Environmental Justice Movement,ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAW; CONSTITUTION; POLITICS; OBESITY; RISK,"The standpoint of environmental justice has become integral to environmental law in the last thirty years. Environmental justice criticizes mainstream environmental law and advocacy institutions on three main fronts: for paying too little attention to the distributive effects of environmental policy; for emphasizing elite and professional advocacy over participation in decision making by affected communities; and for adhering to a woods-and-waters view of which problems count as environmental that disregards the importance of neighborhoods, workplaces, and cities. This Article highlights the existence of a long environmental justice movement that, like the long movements for racial equality and labor organizing, put questions of economic power and distribution, democracy, and workplaces and neighborhoods at the center of environmental politics for many decades before the watershed era of environmental law making, 1970-77. The mystery is why this long environmental justice movement did not have more effect on the mainstream environmental law that arose in that period. The Article shows that we can better understand the omissions of environmental justice concerns by appreciating that mainstream environmental law was the last major legal product of the great exception, the decades of the mid-twentieth century when, unlike any other time in modern history, economic inequality was declining and robust growth was widely shared. The assumptions of that time, along with key contingent decisions by the Ford Foundation, labor unions, and other early funders produced an environmental law that, more than much of the preceding environmental politics, neglected questions of justice. To give both environmental law and environmental justice their due, we must both locate environmental law within our new historical understanding of patterns of economic inequality and recognize that environmental justice is a recovery and extension of an essential and neglected strand of politics and law.","[Purdy, Jedediah] Duke Univ, Sch Law, Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Purdy, J (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Law, Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,161,10,10,0,13,UNIV CALIFORNIA  BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0046-1121,,,ECOL LAW QUART,Ecol.

Thus, monitoring for failure of these systems is crucial to prevent future impacts to life and property. Participatory assessment technique for infrastructure provides a community-based approach to assess the capacity and physical condition of infrastructure. Furthermore, a participatory assessment technique for infrastructure can encourage grassroots activism that engages residents, researchers, and planners in the identification of sustainable development concerns and solutions. As climate change impacts disproportionately affect historically disenfranchised communities, assessment data can further inform planning, aiming to balance the distribution of public resources towards sustainability and justice. This paper explains the development of the participatory assessment technique for infrastructure that can provide empirical data about the condition of infrastructure at the neighborhood-level, using stormwater systems in a vulnerable neighborhood in Houston, Texas as a case study.

This makes it more difficult to identify climate change mitigation strategies that can simultaneously reduce emissions and address place-specific development challenges. In response to this gap, a bottom-up emissions inventory study was undertaken to identify high emission zones and development goals for the Durban metropolitan area (eThekwini Municipality). The study is the first attempt at creating a spatially disaggregated emissions inventory for key sectors in Durban. The results indicate that particular groups and economic activities are responsible for more emissions, and socio-spatial development and emission inequalities are found both within the city and within the high emission zone. This is valuable information for the municipality in tailoring mitigation efforts to reduce emissions and address development gaps for low-carbon spatial planning whilst contributing to objectives for social justice.","[Jagarnath, Meryl] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Westville Campus,Private Bag X 54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Thambiran, Tirusha] CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa; [Thambiran, Tirusha] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa","Jagarnath, M (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Westville Campus,Private Bag X 54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",mjagarnath@gmail.com; tthambiran@csir.co.za,,"Jagarnath, Meryl/0000-0003-1668-1675",National Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for constructive feedback, and to thank Michael Gebreslasie for comments.

We explore the contributions of these articles to the social psychological study of climate change and highlight new challenges and pathways forward.","[Pearson, Adam R.] Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Schuldt, Jonathon P.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Pearson, AR (corresponding author), Pomona Coll, Dept Psychol, 647 N Coll Way, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",adam.pearson@pomona.edu,,,,,,79,4,4,3,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4302,1461-7188,,GROUP PROCESS INTERG,Group Process Intergroup Relat.,APR,2018,21,3,,,SI,,373,388,,10.1177/1368430217747750,,,16,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,GC5EP,WOS:000429808600001,,,,,2021-08-07,

Since its inception, REDD + proponents have increasingly had to adapt global ideas to local demands, as the rollout process was met with on -the -ground realities, including suspicion and protest. As is typical in aid or 'development' projects conceived in the global North, most of the solutions advanced to improve REDD + tend to focus on addressing issues of justice (or 'fairness') in distributive terms, rather than addressing more inherently political objections to REDD + such as those based on rights or social justice. Using data collected from over 700 interviews in five countries with both REDD + and non-REDD + cases, we argue that the failure to incorporate political notions of justice into conservation projects such as REDD + results in 'messiness' within governance systems, which is a symptom of injustice and illegitimacy. We find that, first, conservation, payment for ecosystem services, and REDD + project proponents viewed problems through a technical rather than political lens, leading to solutions that focused on procedures, such as 'benefit distribution.' Second, focusing on the technical aspects of interventions came at the expense of political solutions such as the representation of local people's concerns and recognition of their rights. Third, the lack of attention to representation and recognition justices resulted in illegitimacy. This led to messiness in the governance systems, which was often addressed in technical terms, thereby perpetuating the problem. If messiness is not appreciated and addressed from appropriate notions of justice, projects such as REDD + are destined to fail.","[Myers, Rodd; Larson, Anne M.; Ravikumar, Ashwin; Kowler, Laura F.; Yang, Anastasia; Trench, Tim] CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima 12, Peru; [Myers, Rodd] Dala Inst, Grand Slipi Tower 9G Floor, Jakarta Barat 11480, Indonesia; [Myers, Rodd] Univ East Anglia, Global Environm Justice Grp, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Myers, Rodd] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Forestry, Jl Agro 1, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Ravikumar, Ashwin] Amherst Coll, Dept Environm Studies, 220 S Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Yang, Anastasia] Thuenen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Trench, Tim] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Postgrad Programme Reg Rural Dev, Diego de Mazariegos 85, San Cristobal de las Casa 29240, Chiapas, Mexico","Myers, R (corresponding author), CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima 12, Peru.; Myers, R (corresponding author), Dala Inst, Grand Slipi Tower 9G Floor, Jakarta Barat 11480, Indonesia.; Myers, R (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Global Environm Justice Grp, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.; Myers, R (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Forestry, Jl Agro 1, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",r.myers@dala.institute; a.larson@cgiar.org; ashwinra@gmail.com; LKowler3@gmail.com; anastasia.yang@thuenen.de; tim_trench@yahoo.co.uk,"Myers, Rodd/J-8363-2014","Myers, Rodd/0000-0002-3434-7294; Trench, Tim/0000-0002-0521-1590","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)CGIAR; European Union (EU)CGIAREuropean Commission; International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation; Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)CGIAR; CGIAR FundCGIAR","This research is part of CIFOR's Global Comparative Study on REDD + (www.cifor.org/gcs).

Scattered across the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, these formerly colonized territories are subnational jurisdictions of France. Through examining their greenhouse gas emissions, their ecological importance, their economic conditions, as well as their policies, I argue that understanding the Outre-mer climate change perspectives demands an epistemic shift characterized by two theoretical gestures. Firstly, the Outre-mer perspectives require moving beyond the single geographical imaginary of France that only represents its European mainland. Contributing very little to France's greenhouse gas emissions, these territories are particularly exposed and particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, making the case for a subnational climate justice. Secondly, beyond their portrayal as foreign and voiceless victims, the Outre-mer perspectives also recognize the presence of postcolonial subjects as political and historical actors facing climate change, calling forcefully for postcolonial equality and social justice.","[Ferdinand, Malcom] KITLV Royal Netherlands Inst Southeast Asian & Ca, Leiden, Netherlands","Ferdinand, M (corresponding author), KITLV Royal Netherlands Inst Southeast Asian & Ca, Leiden, Netherlands.",malcomsun@gmail.com,,,,,,71,12,12,0,2,"UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, INST ISLAND STUDIES",CHARLOTTETOWN,"550 UNIV AVE, CHARLOTTETOWN, PE C1A 4P3, CANADA",1715-2593,,,ISL STUD J,Isl.

Development and disaster risk are closely linked as the people and assets exposed to risk, as well as their vulnerability and capacity, are largely determined by development processes. Transformation is key to moving from current development patterns that increase, create or unfairly distribute risks, to forms of development that are equitable, resilient and sustainable. Based on a review of existing literature, we present three opportunities that have the potential to lead to transformation in the development-disaster risk relationship: (i) exposing development-disaster risk trade-offs in development policy and decision-making; (ii) prioritizing equity and social justice in approaches to secure resilience; and (iii) enabling transformation through adaptive governance. This research aims to contribute to breaking down existing barriers in research, policy and practice between the disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and development communities by providing cross-sectoral opportunities to operationalize theoretical knowledge on transformation. It also helps to clarify the connections between different global agendas by positioning transformation as a potential bridging concept to link disconnected policy processes. This paper argues for empirical research to test the opportunities presented here and further define transformative pathways at multiple scales.","[Thomalla, Frank; Boyland, Michael; Johnson, Karlee] Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Thomalla, Frank] Climate & Disaster Risk Res & Consulting CDRC, Sydney, NSW 2176, Australia; [Thomalla, Frank; Boyland, Michael; Johnson, Karlee; Ensor, Jonathan; Tuhkanen, Heidi; Han, Guoyi] Stockholm Environm Inst, Int Ctr Excellence Transforming Dev & Disaster Ri, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Thomalla, Frank; Boyland, Michael; Johnson, Karlee; Ensor, Jonathan; Tuhkanen, Heidi; Han, Guoyi] Integrated Res Disaster Risk IRDR Programme, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Ensor, Jonathan; Forrester, John] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, Environm Dept, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Tuhkanen, Heidi] Stockholm Environm Inst, EE-10416 Tallinn, Estonia; [Swartling, Asa Gerger; Han, Guoyi] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wahl, Darin] Portland State Univ, Coll Urban & Publ Affairs Nohad A Toulon Sch Urba, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.; Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Climate & Disaster Risk Res & Consulting CDRC, Sydney, NSW 2176, Australia.; Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Int Ctr Excellence Transforming Dev & Disaster Ri, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.; Thomalla, F (corresponding author), Integrated Res Disaster Risk IRDR Programme, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",frank.thomalla@cdrc.net.au; michael.boyland@sei.org; karlee.johnson@sei.org; jon.ensor@york.ac.uk; heidi.tuhkanen@sei.org; asa.swartling@sei.org; guoyi.han@sei.org; john.forrester@york.ac.uk; darinwahl@gmail.com,"Swartling, Asa C Gerger/J-1420-2018; Wahl, Darin/AAL-5986-2020; Ensor, Jonathan/M-3313-2014","Swartling, Asa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Wahl, Darin/0000-0003-0396-8423; Ensor, Jonathan/0000-0003-2402-5491; Tuhkanen, Heidi/0000-0003-0025-6922",,,,66,20,20,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1458,10.3390/su10051458,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,WOS:000435587100154,,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2021-08-07,

Urban ecosystem services are affected by both ecosystem characteristics and the social and economic attributes of city dwellers. Yet, there remains little synthesis of the interactions between ecosystem services, urban green spaces, and socio-economic factors. Articulating these linkages is key to their incorporation into ecosystem service planning and management in cities and to ensuring equitable outcomes for city inhabitants. We present a conceptual model of these linkages, describe three major interaction pathways, and explore how to operationalize the model. First, socio-economic factors shape the quantity and quality of green spaces and their ability to supply services by influencing management and planning decisions. Second, variation in socio-economic factors across a city alters people's desires and needs and thus demands for different ecosystem services. Third, socio-economic factors alter the type and amount of benefit for human wellbeing that a service provides. Integrating these concepts into green space policy, planning, and management would be a considerable improvement on 'standards-based' urban green space planning. We highlight the implications of this for facilitating tailored planning solutions to improve ecosystem service benefits across the socio-economic spectrum in cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The evidence is drawn from a 2017 survey that was undertaken by the Association for Rural Advancement (AFRA), which is a land rights Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), of 843 farm dweller households. Data on the current living conditions and livelihoods was collected on 15.3% of the farm dweller population in the area. The paper demonstrates that farm dwellers are a fragmented, agricultural precariat subject to push and pull drivers of mobility that leave them with a precarious hold on rural farm dwellings. The key provocation is that we need to be attentive to whether the hold farm dwellers have over land and livelihoods is slipping further as a result of instability in the agrarian economy? This instability arises from agriculture's arguably maladaptive response to the intersection of structural agrarian change and climate risk in post-apartheid South Africa. While the outcomes will only be apparent in time, the risks are real, and the paper concludes with a call for agrarian policy pathways that are both more adaptive and achieve social justice objectives.","[Hornby, Donna] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Western Cape, South Africa; [Nel, Adrian] Univ KwaZulu Natal, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa; [Chademana, Samuel] Groundwork, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Khanyile, Nompilo] Assoc Rural Adv, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","Hornby, D (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Western Cape, South Africa.",donnahornby@gmail.com; Nela@ukzn.ac.za; samuel@groundwork.org.za; thandilindo@gmail.com,"Nel, Adrian/L-2717-2019","Nel, Adrian/0000-0002-5924-9084; Khanyile, Nompilo/0000-0003-2695-2889",European UnionEuropean Commission,"The European Union made funding available to the Association for Rural Advancement (AFRA) for the data collection and analysis, amongst other project aspects.

We empirically track justice claims of rural villagers upwards through specific intermediaries or justice brokers': civil society, state, or private sector actors operating at local to international levels, who navigate different institutions to advance various social and ecological interests. We draw on interviews with 16 intermediaries in each of Nepal and Uganda and find that recognition of local values and practices such as customary tenure systems are key justice concerns of forest-adjacent communities in each country. However, intermediaries perceive a low likelihood of advancing those claims through national or international climate and forest policy debates, such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), in large part because deliberations on justice are subordinated to concerns such as carbon accounting and arrangements for distributing monetary benefits. This suggests these policy processes must be modified to offer potential for transformational pathways. Intermediaries who pursued recognition justice issues developed innovative tactics in alternative forums. These norm entrepreneurs' adopted a suite of complementary strategies to attain influence, including: (1) formation of associations at the grassroots level; (2) media and advocacy campaigns through national coalitions to reach powerful international donors, and; (3) drawing on international support networks for advice, training and to influence national government.

It is argued, however, that the dominant frames are only superficially environmental and keep reproducing the (anthropocentric) hegemonic ideology. Real change, contrariwise, requires ideological transformation (biocentrism). As one frame can promote various ideologies, familiar frames like 'Cycles of Nature' or 'Environmental Justice' can provide convenient contexts for hegemonic struggles. However, little is known yet about the nature of the hegemonic and counter-hegemonic 'subframes'. Therefore, we have conducted a qualitative framing analysis on a corpus of Belgian mainstream and alternative news articles. The results demonstrate the strong similarities among the two exemplary frames and striking contrasts within the frames. The anthropocentric 'subframes' foreground an external fight with a largely external enemy (carbon dioxide). The biocentric 'subframes' highlight internal problems within human society. However, being quantitatively and qualitatively underdeveloped, the latter still lack the potency to truly inspire. Hence, they require further (collaborative) scrutiny and development.","[Moernaut, Renee; Mast, Jelle] Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Moernaut, R (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",renee.moernaut@vub.be; jelle.mast@vub.be,,"Mast, Jelle/0000-0002-4939-1458",,,,102,0,0,1,12,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1740-8296,2040-0918,,INT J MEDIA CULT POL,Int.

Developing frameworks that are sufficiently integrative to guide research to deliver the necessary insights into all key system aspects is an important outstanding task. Among existing approaches, resilience and nexus framings both allow focus on unpacking relationships across scales and levels in a system and emphasize the involvement of different groups in decision making to different extents. They also suffer weaknesses and neither approach puts social justice considerations explicitly at its core. This has important implications for understanding who wins and loses out from different decisions and how social and ecological risks and trade-offs are shared and distributed, temporally and spatially. This paper conceptually integrates resilience and nexus approaches, developing a combined framework and indicating how it could effectively be operationalized in cases from mountain and mangrove social-ecological systems. In doing so, it advances understanding of complex social-ecological systems framings for risk-based decision making beyond that which could be achieved through use of either resilience or nexus approaches alone. Important next steps in testing the framework involve empirical and field operationalization, requiring interdisciplinary, mixed method approaches.","[Stringer, L. C.; Quinn, C.

By incorporating and considering local people's concerns, these projects are positioned as more effective, efficient and sustainable than 'top-down' climate and development solutions. However, the literature pays little attention to whether and how these projects achieve procedural justice by recognising local people's identities, cultures and values; and providing local people with meaningful participatory opportunities. We address this gap through an analysis of two donor-funded CB-CCD projects in Malawi, drawing on household surveys, semi-structured interviews and documentary materials. Our findings show that the projects had only limited success in facilitating procedural justice for the target populations. Households' meaningful engagement in project activities and decision-making was often curtailed because power asymmetries went unchallenged. While many households were well engaged in projects, the recognition and participation of others-including many of the most vulnerable households-was limited. Building on our findings, we present a six-step approach to help CB-CCD project staff understand, manage and challenge power asymmetries; and create widespread recognition of, and meaningful participatory opportunities for, local people.","[Wood, Benjamin T.; Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.; Quinn, Claire H.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Wood, BT (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bw@xynteo.com; a.j.dougill@leeds.ac.uk; l.stringer@leeds.ac.uk; c.h.quinn@leeds.ac.uk,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228","Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (University of Leeds, UK) [ES/K006576/1]; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish","This research was funded by the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (University of Leeds, UK) (Grant number: ES/K006576/1).",,76,5,5,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9276,,RESOURCES-BASEL,Resources-Basel,JUN,2018,7,2,,,,,,,36,10.3390/resources7020036,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GK4LR,WOS:000436131700013,,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

We argue that analyses of state-level interventions to mitigate the consequences of catastrophic events tend to isolate these measures from their larger social contexts and thereby overlook the uneven distribution of their burden across different groups. We use three cases of pre-modern societies in the northeastern Mediterranean - the sixth century Roman Empire, the tenth century Byzantine Empire, and the sixteenth century Ottoman Empire. We demonstrate how the adaptive processes that reinforced resilience at the state level incurred different burdens for those at lower levels of the social hierarchy. We found that some groups sustained losses while others gained unexpected benefits in the context of temporary systemic instability. We also found that although elites enjoyed enhanced buffers against the adverse effects in comparison with non-elites, this did not consistently guarantee them a better outcome. We conclude that the differentiated burden of resilience could in some cases entrench existing political or economic configurations, and in other cases, overturn them.

Currently, the most vulnerable groups to climate change are low-income urban dwellers, typically residing in urban informalities within cities of the Global South. In Cairo, the awareness about climate change and responsive consumption is minimal and the increase in temperature could have serious effects on residents' health. In 2012, informalities were reported to house two thirds of the population and covered a third of the city's footprint. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of studying environmental performance in informal areas to achieve sustainability and reduce risks. It reviews work related to sustainable urbanization, informal areas, urban heat island and urban climate especially in Cairo. It defines needed parameters and develops an integrated tool to assess comfort in outdoor spaces microclimate. The paper relies on extensive fieldwork, meteorological measurements, socio-environmental surveys, activity mapping and modelling to study both Cairo urban climate and microclimate in one of Cairo's densest informal districts.

In this study, theories, methods and practices of transformative change in the social science literature were interpreted and summarised into three processes perceived by the researchers to contribute to transformative change: ethical awareness, social justice practices and a sense of vision for the future. The interpreted and summarised processes were used to investigate nature strip gardens (edible or native gardens on the footpath) which have been identified as having potential to contribute towards transformative change for environmental issues. Households with a nature strip garden received a letter requesting participation in social justice research about their nature strip garden. A questionnaire based on the summary of transformative change developed by the researchers was utilised with prompts from a social justice scale to carry out eight qualitative interviews. The data was analysed deductively using codes directly from the interpreted summary of social science literature on transformative change, including ecological consciousness, framing issues in terms of power, and changing policy.

Here, the claims and warrants of the movement support for climate debt is identified through an argumentation analysis of their central manifestos. It is found that the climate debt claim is understood as primarily restorative, in the sense that the environmental space of the developing countries must be returned, decolonized. The damage caused by climate change also gives rise to a compensatory adaptation debt. The result is compared with an earlier study on ecological debt. Both concepts are framed within an unjust power relation between North and South, but there are differences. Ecological debt is mainly analyzed in terms of an unjust economic exploitation, which is congenial with its use as an argument for cancellation of Southern external debts; climate debt is rather seen as a violation of communal rights and territories, an argument for climate justice.","[Warlenius, Rikard] Lund Univ, Human Ecol Div, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Warlenius, R (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Human Ecol Div, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",rikard.warlenius@hek.lu.se,,,FP7 Science in Society [266642],"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author acknowledges support from FP7 Science in Society (266642).",,51,5,5,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1070-4965,1552-5465,,J ENVIRON DEV,J.

Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.","[Jenkins, Kirsten] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 348, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [McCauley, Darren] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland","Jenkins, K (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 348, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",k.e.jenkins@sussex.ac.uk; b.sovacool@sussex.ac.uk; dam7@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; McCauley, Darren/0000-0002-3951-1129; Jenkins, Kirsten/0000-0002-3681-647X","Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) [EP/K011790/1]; ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/1001425/1]; EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I035390/1]; ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/I001425/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I035390/1, EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish","The authors are appreciative to the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand, which has supported elements of the work reported here, as well as research grants from the ESRC (ES/1001425/1) and EPSRC (EP/I035390/1).

We expand on the benefits of a slow and processional approach to co-developing research and design questions, tie our process to a theoretical framework connecting transformation design and participatory action research and point toward other potentially valuable frameworks such as civic science.

Primary values emphasised included environmental justice and stewardship. Analysis of the data indicated that groups in this network are distinctive in two particular ways: (1) group focus on mobilising values and environmental concern towards community building can produce what looks like a more conservative approach to climate change mobilisation, preserving and working slowly within institutional structures, with a primary focus not on climate change mitigation per se but on the consolidation and development of the community and broader network; and (2) these groups can often under-report their accomplishments and the footprint of their work on the basis of a common religious conviction which we have termed a culture of modesty.","[Kidwell, Jeremy] Univ Birmingham, Dept Theol & Relig, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Ginn, Franklin] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Northcott, Michael] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Divin, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bomberg, Elizabeth] Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hague, Alice] James Hutton Inst, Dundee, Scotland","Kidwell, J (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Dept Theol & Relig, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",j.kidwell@bham.ac.uk,"Kidwell, Jeremy/A-6832-2009","Kidwell, Jeremy/0000-0001-5954-4246; Hague, Alice/0000-0003-4874-7050",Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [AH/K005456/1],"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: AH/K005456/1",,73,3,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2054-4049,,,GEO-GEOGR ENVIRON,Geo-Geogr.

Foreign states, corporations, and financial institutions have historically shaped the form and terms of the country's energy system, which is predominantly fossil fuel based. Shifting geographies of energy extraction and processing continue to reflect this past and influence current national energy debates in Bangladesh. The Rampal coal-fired energy project, a joint initiative with India, exemplifies these tensions. Opposition to the Rampal plant, proposed in the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans region, and other controversial energy extraction and processing projects led some activists and impacted stakeholders to promote the idea of our energy, our rights. The articulation of an energy rights discourse asserts that Bangladesh should extract and control national energy resources in a manner that respects rights and provides the basis for analyzing the energy justice landscape in the nation and beyond. The rights discourse rejects the nation's legacy of poor energy decisions, and the associated realities of energy poverty. Contributing to emerging ideas around the geographies of energy justice, this research paper explores the practical application by activists and stakeholders of rights discourses to contested energy projects in Bangladesh. It shows how distributional energy justice activism critiques the historical political economy of economic liberalization and energy exploitation in the country and centers the rights concerns of energy poverty while also considering climate change vulnerabilities.","[Bedi, Heather Plumridge] Dickinson Coll, 28 N Coll St, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA","Bedi, HP (corresponding author), Dickinson Coll, 28 N Coll St, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",bedih@dickinson.edu,,,Dickinson College Faculty-Student Collaborative Grant,"This research would not have been possible without the support of Seuty Sabur and Nusrat Chowdhury.

The concept of polycentricity has been at the center of recent debates in environmental governance. While most of this work has analyzed polycentric arrangements in relation to collaborative and adaptive governance, some have recently focused on how political conflicts shape these arrangements. In this paper we build on this work through Luther Gerlach's forgotten framework of polycentric social movements to undertake the task of politicizing polycentricity. This task entails expanding the analytical focus of institutional analyses of polycentricity and examining the social group politics of social movements. To this end, we present a case study of the climate justice movement and its relation to climate change governance. We analyze whether and to what extent the movement has embodied polycentric arrangements throughout its history, and to what effects. We show that show that, in seeking to address the multiscalar nature of environmental problems and the limits of existing institutional arrangements, climate justice groups are increasingly organized in a polycentric fashion. Climate justice groups mobilize multiple strands of environmental justice movements from the global North and South, as well as from indigenous and peasant rights movements, and it is organized as a decentralized network of semiautonomous, coordinated units. We find that this strategy generates new opportunities and challenges for the movement, and thus has important implications for its effectiveness in achieving these transformations. Lastly, we find that through these polycentric arrangements, movements such as that for climate justice are able to exert simultaneous influence on multiple sites of environmental governance, from the local to the global, furthering increased polycentricity in formal institutional arrangements.","[Tormos-Aponte, Fernando] Univ Missouri, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Garcia-Lopez, Gustavo A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Grad Sch Planning, Rio Piedras, PR USA","Tormos-Aponte, F (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Univ Blvd 347 SSB, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",fernando@scholarsstrategynetwork.org,"Tormos, Fernando/M-1144-2019","Tormos, Fernando/0000-0002-1781-1016; Garcia Lopez, Gustavo/0000-0002-8005-1574",,,,84,14,14,1,14,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

India's western region presents a complex context within which to examine why these trajectories unfold in particular ways and to what end. This article first situates India's renewable energy policy within the dynamics of its federal politics. It then focusses on the trajectory of renewable energy development in two Western Indian states, Rajasthan and Gujarat, highlighting how regional particularities and path dependence have shaped the emergence of solar energy, often in ways that run counter to both expected and hoped for results. The idea of energy justice is subsequently introduced as a way to evaluate whether solar energy infrastructural growth in its present form is best serving the multi-pronged needs of climate justice, economic development, and social equity. By combining a political economy of renewable energy that accounts for the political and institutional factors conditioning the growth of solar capacity with the normative arguments embedded in the energy justice literature, this study contributes to a growing understanding of the intersection of solar power and development.","[Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Fosswinckelsgate 6, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Kale, Sunila S.] Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98185 USA","Sareen, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Fosswinckelsgate 6, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",Siddharth.Sareen@uib.no; kale@uw.edu,"Sareen, Siddharth/D-8961-2015","Sareen, Siddharth/0000-0002-0826-7311",Regulatory Assistance Project within Mapping Power project; University of Bergen; University of Washington-SeattleUniversity of Washington,"We acknowledge funding from the Regulatory Assistance Project that made empirical research possible within the Mapping Power project (http://www.cprindia.org/projects/mapping-power), and are grateful to Navroz Dubash and Ranjit Bharvirkar.

We also need to develop new social practices and encourage a broader cultural shift towards sustainability. Against this background, this paper explores the role of mindfulness in adapting to increasing risk and climate change. Based on a literature review, it assesses current research on 'mindful climate adaptation', and explores how individual mindfulness is linked to climate adaptation. While in practice mindfulness-based approaches to climate adaptation have gained widespread recognition (e.g., by the United Nations), the results show that related research is scarce and fragmented. There is almost no research into the role of mindfulness in climate adaptation. At the same time, new scientific domains are opening up in cognate fields that illuminate the mindfulness-adaptation nexus from certain perspectives. These fields include: (1) disaster management; (2) individual well-being; (3) organisational management; (4) environmental behaviour; (5) social justice; and (6) knowledge production. As new concepts and approaches emerge, they require critical construct validation and empirical testing. The importance of further investigation is supported by a complementary empirical study, which shows that individual mindfulness disposition coincides with increased motivation to take (or support) climate adaptation actions. The paper concludes that mindfulness has the potential to facilitate adaptation at all scales (through cognitive, managerial, structural, ontological, and epistemological change processes) and should, therefore, become a core element in climate and associated sustainability research. Finally, it sketches the conceptual trajectories of the mindfulness-adaptation nexus and presents a pioneering, comprehensive framework for 'mindful climate adaptation'.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden","Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Box 170, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,,,,,191,21,22,4,43,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Climate geoengineering is one possible approach. But repair is under-researched and underspecified in this context. In a first attempt to establish basic principles for the obligations of repair in the Anthropocene, five disciplines of repair are briefly reviewed: reconstruction of historic buildings; remediation of human bodies; restoration of ecosystems; reconfiguration of cultural materials and artifacts; and reconciliation of broken relationships. In each case ethical practices and debates are described to help identify key themes and challenges in understanding repair. Three interlinked pragmatic ethics or virtues of repair in the Anthropocene are suggested: care, integrity, and legibility. Implications for climate geoengineering, climate politics, and the possibilities of climate justice are explored. Climate repair is defended against objections that it would exacerbate a moral hazard effect, or frame climate responses as politically conservative.","[McLaren, Duncan P.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England","McLaren, DP (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4QY, England.",d.mclaren@lancaster.ac.uk,,"McLaren, Duncan/0000-0002-2294-282X",,,,77,9,9,3,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people's daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second homeowners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people centric values for achieving fair adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, agricultural policies tend to focus on food supply, and sometimes, on mechanisms to address negative externalities. We propose an alternative. Our starting point is that agriculture and food systems' policies should be aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This calls for deep changes in comparison with the paradigms that prevailed when steering the agricultural change in the XXth century. We identify the comprehensive food systems transformation that is needed. It has four parts: first, food systems should enable all people to benefit from nutritious and healthy food. Second, they should reflect sustainable agricultural production and food value chains. Third, they should mitigate climate change and build resilience. Fourth, they should encourage a renaissance of rural territories. The implementation of the transformation relies on (i) suitable metrics to aid decision-making, (ii) synergy of policies through convergence of local and global priorities, and (iii) enhancement of development approaches that focus on territories. We build on the work of the Milano Group, an informal group of experts convened by the UN Secretary General in Milan in 2015. Backed by a literature review, what emerges is a strategic narrative linking climate, agriculture and food, and calling for a deep transformation of food systems at scale. This is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The narrative highlights the needed consistency between global actions for sustainable development and numerous local-level innovations. It emphasizes the challenge of designing differentiated paths for food systems transformation responding to local and national expectations. Scientific and operational challenges are associated with the alignment and arbitration of local action within the context of global priorities.","[Caron, Patrick; Hainzelin, Etienne] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; [Caron, Patrick] CIRAD, DGDRS, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Ferrero y de Loma-Osorio, Gabriel] Minist Foreign Affairs & Cooperat, Planta 1,Serrano Galvache 26, Madrid 28071, Spain; [Nabarro, David] Imperial Coll, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Hainzelin, Etienne] CIRAD, DG, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Guillou, Marion] Agreenium, 42 Rue Scheffer, F-75116 Paris, France; [Andersen, Inger] IUCN, Rue Mauverney 28, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland; [Arnold, Tom] Inst Int & European Affairs, 8 N Great Georges St, Dublin, Ireland; [Astralaga, Margarita] IFAD, Via Paolo di Dono 44, I-00142 Rome, RM, Italy; [Beukeboom, Marcel] Minist Infrastruct Milieu, Minist Econ Zaken & Klimaat, The Hague, Netherlands; [Bickersteth, Sam] Oxford Martin Sch, Econ Council Planetary Hlth, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England; [Bwalya, Martin] NEPAD Agcy, 233 15th Rd, Midrand, South Africa; [Caballero, Paula] RARE, 1310 N Courthouse Rd,Ste 110, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Campbell, Bruce M.] Wageningen Univ & Res, CCAFS, CGIAR, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Divine, Ntiokam] SDG Act Campaign, Climate Smart Agr Youth Network, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Fan, Shenggen] IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Andersen, Inger; Frick, Martin] UNFCC, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Friis, Anette] Wageningen Univ & Res, CCAFS Program Management Unit, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gallagher, Martin] Dept Foreign Affairs & Trade, Iveagh House,80 St Stephens Green, Dublin, Ireland; [Halkin, Jean-Pierre] European Commiss, 200 Rue Loi, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Hanson, Craig; Steer, Andrew] World Resources Inst, 10 G St NE,Suite 800, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Lasbennes, Florence] 8 Chemin Gue, F-01210 Ferney Voltaire, France; [Ribera, Teresa] IDDRI, 41 Rue Four, F-75006 Paris, France; [Rockstrom, Johan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Schuepbach, Marlen; Verburg, Gerda] Palais Nations, Scaling Nutr Movement, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Tutwiler, Ann] Biovers Int, Via Tre Denari 472-A, I-00057 Rome, Italy","Caron, P (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France.; Caron, P (corresponding author), CIRAD, DGDRS, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",patrick.caron@cirad.fr,,"Rockstrom, Johan/0000-0001-8988-2983; Hainzelin, Etienne/0000-0003-1303-3082; Caron, Patrick/0000-0002-8494-2243",,,,56,47,48,4,36,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

Yet, mainstream media are criticized for only reproducing anthropocentrism when discussing the concern, while this ideology causes socio-environmental problems. Current research is preoccupied with the verbal mode, while visual and verbal modes always work in tandem. This prevents a full understanding of the problems. Also, most studies overlook the alternative media, which may counterbalance the dominant perspective. We have therefore carried out a multimodal framing analysis of a corpus of mainstream and alternative articles published in Belgium. The identified subframes, 'Unequal Vulnerability' and 'Unequal Attribution', show a remarkable reversal of roles and responsibilities. Yet, the counter-hegemonic subframe is still struggling to find a salient multimodal language to depict complex views. Further development is necessary. We hope that this study incites other research on multimodal framing in general and environmental justice in particular.","[Moernaut, Renee; Mast, Jelle] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Linguist & Literary Studies Appl Linguisti, Brussels, Belgium; [Moernaut, Renee; Pepermans, Yves] Univ Antwerp, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium","Moernaut, R (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Linguist, TTKA LW, Pl Laan 5,Room 308, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Renee.Moernaut@vub.be,,"Mast, Jelle/0000-0002-4939-1458",,,,57,1,1,2,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1748-0485,1748-0493,,INT COMMUN GAZ,Int.

To inform regional responses to climate change, decision-makers need credible and relevant information representing a wide swath of knowledge and perspectives. The southeastern U. S. State of Georgia is a valuable focal area for study because it contains multiple ecological zones that vary greatly in land use and economic activities, and it is vulnerable to diverse climate change impacts. We identified 40 important research questions that, if answered, could lay the groundwork for effective, science-based climate action in Georgia. Top research priorities were identified through a broad solicitation of candidate research questions (180 were received). A group of experts across sectors and disciplines gathered for a workshop to categorize, prioritize, and filter the candidate questions, identify missing topics, and rewrite questions. Participants then collectively chose the 40 most important questions. This cross-sectoral effort ensured the inclusion of a diversity of topics and questions (e.g., coastal hazards, agricultural production, ecosystem functioning, urban infrastructure, and human health) likely to be important to Georgia policy-makers, practitioners, and scientists. Several cross-cutting themes emerged, including the need for long-term data collection and consideration of at-risk Georgia citizens and communities. Workshop participants defined effective responses as those that take economic cost, environmental impacts, and social justice into consideration. Our research highlights the importance of collaborators across disciplines and sectors, and discussing challenges and opportunities that will require transdisciplinary solutions.","[Rudd, Murray A.; Moore, Althea F.

Research Method: This study employs a qualitative research design with semistructured interviews. Twenty-two elementary and secondary school principals were interviewed in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. Research Findings: Principals who are social justice advocates exercise their influence by focusing on people in an effort to build a socially just community. Their people-centered leadership practice focuses on: putting students at the center, positioning as a social justice leader, developing people for social justice, building school climate through social justice, and fostering positive relationships with families and communities. Social justice leadership is grounded in a very proactive way in bringing about the changes that such a paradigm demands. Implications: This study generates discussions among participants on the dynamics associated with social justice practice and helps practitioners navigate tactically entrenched power structures for the well-being of their students. It also deepens our understanding of social justice leadership by providing empirical evidence how social justice advocates take risks and innovative approaches to social change that embraces the value of democracy, inclusion, representation, and difference.","[Wang, Fei] Univ British Columbia, Fac Educ, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Studies, Educ Ctr Ponderosa Commons, 6445 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",fei.wang@ubc.ca,,,,,,60,10,10,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0013-161X,1552-3519,,EDUC ADMIN QUART,Educ.

As coal production declines or consumption is phased out in parts of the Global North, the future of coal will likely be decided in the Global South. In this article, we explore energyscapes, as multiple and nested sites of connectivity over energy, and their relation to energy justice, environmental conflicts and social movements in new geographies of coal. By putting into question the reproduction of multiple levels of socio-environmental injustices related to coal's extraction and consumption, we trace the emerging South-South coal links with an empirical focus on Colombia and Turkey. Coal extraction and consumption, respectively, in these geographically distant but increasingly connected countries are linked by multiscalar socio-ecological interactions and conflicts. After exploring these interactions, we examine the changing energyscapes of coal operating on different layers (the market, the physical, and the socio-environmental damages) between the two countries. Our analysis reveals that these new geographies are anchored in cross-scalar environmental injustices and democratic deficits, only sustained with top down measures and emerging bilateral dependencies. The coming challenge for energy justice, therefore, is to link local communities' claims and democratization of energyscapes between the supply and the demand sides.","[Cardosa, Andrea] Univ Magdalena, Carrera 32 22-08, Santa Marta 470004, Colombia; [Cardosa, Andrea] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Edif Z,Carrer Columnes, E-08193 Bellaterra, Spain; [Turhan, Ethemcan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Environm Humanities Lab, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden","Cardosa, A (corresponding author), Univ Magdalena, Carrera 32 22-08, Santa Marta 470004, Colombia.",acardoso@unimagdalena.edu.co; ethemcan@kth.se,,"Cardoso, Andrea/0000-0001-9985-154X","Colciencias (Convocatoria), Universidad del Magdalena and EnvJustice project [695446]; ISSC; Sida","We are grateful to Joan Martinez-Alier for his invaluable guidance and support; to the post-extractivismo group in Barcelona for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts; to Bans Sanh for bringing the historical graph in Fig. 3 into our attention.

An empirical investigation on the distributive effects of drought events in some areas of Southern Europe,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Drought; Distributive effects; Consumer surplus; Social justice; Agriculture,SECURITY; IMPACTS,"Studies on the impacts of drought usually make the implicit assumption that there will always be a negative effect on the environment, the economy and society. However, other approaches, based for example on the framework provided by the consumer surplus theory, try to focus on the distributive effects of drought. In this paper, in the wake of such approaches, we address the question of the distributive effects of drought on agriculture, exploring and studying in depth the characteristics, the signs and the magnitude of the socio-economic impacts of droughts on specific significant agricultural areas in Europe. According to our estimations, essentially based on the analysis of trends and changes in production and prices, we found that drought events can create not only losers, but also winners. Some social groups (for example, some categories of farmers) can even win, while others lose (for example, final consumers). These findings apparently introduce questions of social justice in the evaluation of the impacts of climate change. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For many years, toxic contamination and a combined sewer overflow problem inhibited new development in the neighbourhood. But in recent years, particularly beginning in 2010, after the Environmental Protection Agency designated the Canal and surrounding areas a Superfund site targeted for clean-up, developers have sought to shed Gowanus's industrial identity and recast it as a prime up-and-coming residential locale. Although the community celebrates environmental restoration and protection, there is also a sense of foreboding that clean-up is paving the way for high-end development projects. This article charts the progress of neoliberal urban development in Gowanus through the lens of critical urban theory, identifying stakeholders and power dynamics. It looks at rezoning/revitalization as a tool of the municipality to transform an industrial business zone and low-income neighbourhood, ostensibly to foster development and cope with climate change and sea-level rise, but, in fact, cultivates socio-political exclusion and gentrification while ignoring concerns over the long-term environmental viability of new development.","[Turan, Zeynep] CUNY, New Sch, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Turan, Zeynep] CUNY, John Jay Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA","Turan, Z (corresponding author), CUNY, New Sch, New York, NY 10021 USA.; Turan, Z (corresponding author), CUNY, John Jay Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",zeynept7@gmail.com,"Turan, Zeynep/AAU-1413-2021","Turan, Zeynep/0000-0002-9021-4680",,,,21,1,1,4,15,URBAN PLANNING INST REPUBLIC SLOVENIA,LJUBLJANA,"TRNOVSKI PRISTAN 2, P P 4717, LJUBLJANA, 1127, SLOVENIA",0353-6483,1855-8399,,URBANI IZZIV,Urbani Izziv,SEP,2018,29,,,,SI,,79,94,,10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2018-29-supplement-005,,,16,Urban Studies,Urban Studies,HJ3GQ,WOS:000457058900006,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

The second phase of the project, known as the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda offers an increased emphasis on lessening the mitigating factors associated with climate change and adapting to the negative effects of climate change. Nurses are in the unique position to address the health-related impacts related to climate change through community health approaches aimed at education and promotion of environmental stewardship. Purpose: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the relationships among the health consequences of climate change, nursing literature on climate change, and nursing implications. The following will be addressed: What is nursing's role in policy, practice, and advocacy when addressing the effects of climate change? What is the importance of the SDGs as a framework for addressing climate change in the role of nursing? Method: This scoping review of the literature was conducted which included the evaluation of a broad range of articles using scoping methods as frameworks. Findings: An overarching theme regarding the nursing community's responsibility in addressing the effects of climate change and their role as advocates, educators, and global citizens was extracted from the scoping review. Discussion: There are many opportunities for nurses to become actively involved in efforts aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in climate change, including becoming involved in policy, advocacy, research, and practice opportunities.","[Lilienfeld, Elisha; Nicholas, Patrice K.; Breakey, Suellen; Corless, Inge B.] MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Sch Nursing, Ctr Climate Change Climate Justice & Hlth, Boston, MA 02129 USA","Nicholas, PK (corresponding author), MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Sch Nursing, Ctr Climate Change Climate Justice & Hlth, Boston, MA 02129 USA.",nicholas.patrice@mgh.harvard.edu,,,,,,38,16,16,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0029-6554,1528-3968,,NURS OUTLOOK,Nurs.

The present research examined attitudes toward different environmental policies, specifically focusing on the role of perceived justice. Justice was measured in two ways: as an assessment of the fairness of a particular policy and as a general tendency to endorse statements related to environmental justice. Because justice judgments can be context specific, policies were presented in four conditions, in a 2 x 2 design manipulating the type of impact described, ecological or societal, and the level of focus, individual or collective. The roles of political ideology and environmentalism were also investigated. Results from an online sample of 162 US residents showed that non-coercive policies, overall, were rated as more acceptable. Environmental justice statements were strongly endorsed, and justice in both its specific and general forms was a determinant of policy acceptance. In particular, ratings of the fairness of specific policies were a stronger determinant of acceptability than perceived effectiveness of the policy. Type of impact had little effect, but policies tended to be rated as more acceptable when they were framed in terms of the collective rather than the individual. Although a liberal ideology was associated with acceptance of environmental policies in general and with endorsement of environmental justice, controlling for endorsement of environmental justice eliminated the effect of political ideology in most, but not all, cases. Implications for policy support are discussed.","[Clayton, Susan] Coll Wooster, 930 Coll Mall, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Clayton, S (corresponding author), Coll Wooster, 930 Coll Mall, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",sclayton@wooster.edu,"Clayton, Susan/T-1364-2019; Clayton, Susan/S-3642-2017","Clayton, Susan/0000-0002-2343-6865",,,,44,9,9,5,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-7466,1573-6725,,SOC JUSTICE RES,Soc.

However, the effects of these mitigation policies have rarely been evaluated with respect to their influence on disadvantaged communities. Here we assess the air pollution and environmental justice implications of California's cap-and-trade mitigation program through analysis of (1) the sources of air pollution in disadvantaged communities, (2) emissions-reduction offset usage under the cap-and-trade program, and (3) the relationship between reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and reductions in co-pollutant emissions. Our analysis suggests that the cap-and-trade program has limited impacts, including limited disproportionate impacts, on air quality in disadvantaged communities. The sources of most air pollution in these communities have not been subject to the cap-and-trade program, and the use of emissions-reduction offsets is only marginally higher in disadvantaged communities than in other communities. Furthermore, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply smaller proportional reductions in co-pollutant emissions. While climate policies lead to important air quality co-benefits in some contexts, especially through reduced coal usage, targeted air quality policies and regulations may be more effective for reducing air pollution in disadvantaged communities in California and throughout the state.","[Anderson, Christa M.] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kissel, Kendall A.] Stanford Univ, Earth Syst Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Field, Christopher B.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Machu, Katharine J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Anderson, CM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",andersn@stanford.edu,"Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017","Anderson, Christa/0000-0003-3012-6002",S.

This study is part of a larger effort exploring Innovations in the Food-Energy-Water Nexus (INFEWS) in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) through coordinated modeling and simulated management scenarios. Here, we focus on a case study and conceptual mapping of the Yakima River Basin (YRB), a sub-basin of the CRB. Previous research on FEW system management and resilience includes some attention to social dynamics (e.g., economic and governance systems); however, more attention to social drivers and outcomes is needed. Our goals are to identify several underutilized ways to incorporate social science perspectives into FEW nexus research and to explore how this interdisciplinary endeavor alters how we assess innovations and resilience in FEW systems. First, we investigate insights on FEW nexus resilience from the social sciences. Next, we delineate strategies for further incorporation of social considerations into FEW nexus research, including the use of social science perspectives and frameworks such as socio-ecological resilience and community capitals. Then, we examine a case study of the YRB, focusing on the historical development of the FEW nexus and innovations. We find that a resilience focus applied to the FEW nexus can inadvertently emphasize a status quo imposed by those already in power. Incorporating perspectives from the social sciences, which highlight issues related to inequality, power, and social justice, can address these shortcomings and inform future innovations. Finally, we use causal loop diagrams to explore the role of the social in the FEW nexus, and we suggest ways to incorporate social aspects into an existing stock and flow object-oriented modeling system. This project represents a starting point for a continued research agenda that incorporates social dynamics into FEW system resilience modeling and management in the CRB.","[Givens, Jennifer E.; Briscoe, Michael] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Padowski, Julie] Washington State Univ, State Washington Water Res Ctr, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Padowski, Julie] Washington State Univ, Ctr Environm Res Educ & Outreach, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Guzman, Christian D.; Malek, Keyvan; Boll, Jan; Adam, Jennifer] Washington State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Witinok-Huber, Rebecca] Univ Idaho, Water Resources Grad Program, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Cosens, Barbara] Univ Idaho, Coll Law, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Cosens, Barbara] Univ Idaho, Waters West Program, Moscow, ID 83843 USA","Givens, JE (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",jennifer.givens@usu.edu,,"Givens, Jennifer/0000-0003-3103-9795",NSF EARNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1639458]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2017-67004-26131],"We would like to thank the Columbia River FEW team composed of researchers from Washington State University, University of Idaho, Utah State University, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories for their collaboration, research support, and helpful discussions in formulating conceptualizations of FEW systems and resilience.

Flood risk assessments are usually used to identify vulnerable locations and populations, flooding experience patterns, or levels of concern about flooding, but rarely are all of these approaches combined. Furthermore, the social dynamics of flood concerns, exposure, and experience are underexplored. We combined geographic and survey data on household-level measures of flood experience, concern, and exposure in Utah's urbanizing Wasatch Front. We asked: (1) Are socially vulnerable groups more likely to be exposed to flood risk? (2) How common are flooding experiences among urban residents, and how are these experiences related to sociodemographic characteristics and exposure? and (3) How concerned are urban residents about flooding, and does concern vary by exposure, flood experience, and sociodemographic characteristics? Although floodplain residents were more likely to be White and have higher incomes, respondents who were of a racial/ethnic minority, were older, had less education, and were living in floodplains were more likely to report flood experiences and concern about flooding. Flood risk management approaches need to address social as well as physical sources of vulnerability to floods and recognize social sources of variation in flood experiences and concern.","[Hale, Rebecca L.] Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [Flint, Courtney G.] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Endter-Wada, Joanna] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Jackson-Smith, Douglas] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Wooster, OH USA","Hale, RL (corresponding author), Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",halereb3@isu.edu,"Jackson-Smith, Douglas/AAQ-8400-2021","Jackson-Smith, Douglas/0000-0002-0671-5862","National Science Foundation under EPSCoR [IIA 1208732]; EPSCoR grant, Idaho EPSCoR Program [IIA 1301792]; Koch funds",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under EPSCoR grant IIA 1208732 awarded to Utah State University as part of the State of Utah EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Award and EPSCoR grant IIA 1301792 as part of the Idaho EPSCoR Program.

In this study, an interdisciplinary team of university scientists, partnering with local organizations, developed and facilitated EHL trainings with special focus on rainwater harvesting and water contamination, in four communities with known environmental health stressors in Arizona, USA. These participatory trainings incorporated participants' prior environmental health risk knowledge and personal experiences to co-create training content. Mixed methods evaluation was conducted via pre-post participant surveys in all four trainings (n = 53). Participants who did not demonstrate baseline environmental science knowledge pre-training demonstrated significant knowledge increase post-training, and participants who demonstrated low self-efficacy (SE) pre-training demonstrated a significant increase in SE post-training. Participants overall demonstrated a significant increase in specific environmental health skills described post-training. The interdisciplinary facilitator-scientist team also reported multiple benefits, including learning local knowledge that informed further research, and building trust relationships with community members for future collaboration. We propose contextual EHL education as a valuable strategy for increasing EHL in environmental health risk communities, and for building academia-community partnerships for environmental health research and action.","[Davis, Leona F.; Buxner, Sanlyn] Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E Second St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Ramirez-Andreotta, Monica D.; McLain, Jean E.

Social work as a profession and social workers within communities are uniquely qualified to identify and respond to these environmental health challenges.

At the same, ecological research directed to health vulnerabilities provides a problem-based unifying framework for urban ecologists. Objective Provide a framework for expanding ecological research to address human health vulnerabilities in cities. Methods I pose an urban ecology of human health framework that considers how the ecological contributions to health risks and benefits are driven by interacting influences of the environment, active management, and historical legacies in the context of ecological self-organization. The ecology of health framework is explored for contrasting examples includingheat, vector borne diseases, pollution, and accessible greenspace both individually and in a multifunctional landscape perspective. Results Urban ecological processes affect human health vulnerability through contributions to multiple hazard and well-being pathways. The resulting multifunctional landscape of health vulnerability features prominent hotspots and regional injustices. A path forward to increase knowledge of the ecological contributions to health vulnerabilities includes increased participation in in interdisciplinary teams and applications of high resolution environmental sensing and modeling. Conclusions Research and management from a systems and landscape perspective of ecological processes is poised to help reduce urban health vulnerability and provide a better understanding of ecological dynamics in the Anthropocene.","[Jenerette, G.

Previous research has focused on individual factors that influence public perceptions of hazards, such as politics, ideology, and cultural worldviews, as well as on socioeconomic and demographic factors that affect geographically based vulnerability, environmental justice, and community resilience. Few studies have investigated individual socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in public risk perceptions of the health hazards associated with extreme heat events, which are now increasing due to climate change. This study uses multilevel statistical modeling to investigate individual- and geographic-level (e.g., census tract level and regional) social, economic, and biophysical influences on public perceptions of the adverse health impacts associated with heat waves. Political orientation and climate change beliefs are the strongest predictors of heat wave health risk perceptions; household income also has a relatively strong and consistent effect. Contextual socioeconomic vulnerability, measured with a social vulnerability index at the census tract level, also significantly affects heat wave risk perceptions. The strong influence of political orientation and climate beliefs on perceptions of adverse health impacts from heat waves suggests that ideological predispositions can increase vulnerability to climate change.","[Cutler, Matthew J.; Marlon, Jennifer R.; Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Cutler, MJ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",matthew.cutler@yale.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Marlon, Jennifer/0000-0002-8299-9609","11th Hour ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project; Energy Foundation; Grantham Foundation; MacArthur Foundation; V.K.

Crop production will be affected by many changes in its climatic, agronomic, economic, and societal contexts. Therefore, breeders are challenged to produce cultivars that strengthen both ecological and societal resilience by striving for six international sustainability targets: food security, safety and quality; food and seed sovereignty; social justice; agrobiodiversity; ecosystem services; and climate robustness. Against this background, we review the state of the art in plant breeding by distinguishing four paradigmatic orientations that currently co-exist: community-based breeding, ecosystem-based breeding, trait-based breeding, and corporate-based breeding, analyzing differences among these orientations. Our main findings are: (1) all four orientations have significant value but none alone will achieve all six sustainability targets; (2) therefore, an overarching approach is needed: systems-based breeding, an orientation with the potential to synergize the strengths of the ways of thinking in the current paradigmatic orientations; (3) achieving that requires specific knowledge development and integration, a multitude of suitable breeding strategies and tools, and entrepreneurship, but also a change in attitude based on corporate responsibility, circular economy and true-cost accounting, and fair and green policies. We conclude that systems-based breeding can create strong interactions between all system components. While seeds are part of the common good and the basis of agrobiodiversity, a diversity in breeding approaches, based on different entrepreneurial approaches, can also be considered part of the required agrobiodiversity. To enable systems-based breeding to play a major role in creating sustainable agriculture, a shared sense of urgency is needed to realize the required changes in breeding approaches, institutions, regulations and protocols. Based on this concept of systems-based breeding, there are opportunities for breeders to play an active role in the development of an ecologically and societally resilient, sustainable agriculture.","[van Bueren, Edith T.

By using a unique and geolocated database on natural disasters in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I test whether variables related to public policies - e.g. forest cover and urban infrastructure - affect the occurrence of natural disasters, conditional on the existence of extreme rainfall. Results point to a significant role for public policies in order to mitigate effects of extreme weather events. More specifically, results point to an important role for urban infrastructure, as proper sewage and waste collection, and forest cover in reducing the impacts of extreme rainfall. Moreover, I discuss how these heterogeneous effects have distributional consequences and can be linked to the Environmental Justice literature. Finally, this paper reinforces the idea that adaptation policies to disasters are essential in reducing local vulnerabilities and can yield distributional and fiscal benefits.","[Sant'Anna, Andre Albuquerque] Brazilian Dev Bank, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Sant'Anna, AA (corresponding author), Brazilian Dev Bank, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",andre.santanna@bndes.gov.br,,,,,,57,10,10,5,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

As latent topics like moral values are affected by word polysemy and synonymy, a traditional keyword-based approach is often ineffective and therefore inappropriate. As a result, scientific literature addressing latent topics tends to be fragmented thereby constraining efforts to address similar and complementary research challenges. A novel approach to reviewing the literature by utilizing both semantic fields and probabilistic topic models has therefore been developed. We illustrate this approach by reviewing the literature addressing the value justice in the energy sector and compare this with a regular keyword-based approach. The new approach results in a more complete overview of the relevance of energy justice as compared to the traditional keyword-based approach. This novel approach can be applied to other latent topics including other values or phenomena such as societal resistance to technologies, thereby leading to an increased understanding of existing relevant literature and the identification of new areas of research.","Delft Univ Technol, Dept Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands","de Wildt, TE (corresponding author), Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",t.e.dewildt@tudelft.nl,"Chappin, Emile J.

We then illustrate this approach through three brief case studies of multi-scalar solar uptake in Portugal, bringing out how justice considerations are intricately involved in the practices and politics of these concrete, broadly representative instances of sustainable energy transitions.","[Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Fosswinckelsgate 6, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Bergen, Norway","Sareen, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Fosswinckelsgate 6, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",Siddharth.Sareen@uib.no,"Sareen, Siddharth/D-8961-2015","Sareen, Siddharth/0000-0002-0826-7311; Haarstad, Havard/0000-0002-2791-9282",Bergen Research Foundation; Statoil; University of Bergen,"The authors wish to thank the Bergen Research Foundation, and the Akademia Agreement between Statoil and the University of Bergen for funding this research.

It has been suggested that the third mission of universities in the Global South may be particularly significant in addressing acutely felt issues of climate change, economic inequalities, food insecurity and urban sprawl. The current paper explores this and asks whether the quadruple helix (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010) is visible in their engagement activities. Using a synthesis of case studies developed as part of the 'Strengthening Urban Engagement of Universities in Africa and Asia' (SUEUAA) project, a collaborative research project spanning seven cities (Glasgow; Harare; Dar-es-Salaam; Johannesburg; Duhok; Sanandaj; and Manila), we explore ongoing engagement activities where universities respond to city demand. We frame this in terms of Sustainable Development Goals. Results indicate while universities were seen to address city demands, they often reacted without a network of other influential actors (i.e. industry, local government or NGO partners). This suggests that currently, the quadruple helix is underdeveloped in these cities, and more work should be done in creating closer links.","[Neary, Joanne] Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Osborne, Michael] Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, Adult & Lifelong Learning, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Neary, J (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, Coll Social Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",joanne.neary@glasgow.ac.uk,"Osborne, Michael/A-6216-2015","Osborne, Michael/0000-0002-1609-385X",British Academy [CI170271],"This work derives from the SUEUAA project (Reference CI170271.), which is funded by the British Academy under the Cities and Infrastructure programme, which is part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, itself part of the UK's Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitment.

J,"Eckenwiler, L",,,,"Eckenwiler, Lisa",,,Displacement and solidarity: An ethic of place-making,BIOETHICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,displacement; justice; migrants; migration; place-making; refugees; solidarity,HEALTH; CARE; PLACEMAKING; REFUGEES,"When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice. A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc. ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'. Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice. Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics. After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world. In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP. As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects. We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'. Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health. European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making. In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place. On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

This is problematic as the development of energy systems and the rapid acceleration of climate change are directly tied to human activity. When the social sciences are incorporated in energy and climate research, their scope is frequently economically oriented. Methodological approaches remain frequently quantitative in nature. While important, these approaches cannot fully capture the nuances of power, inequality, and justice within decisionmaking processes that create and constitute our energy systems and subsequent climate change impacts and outcomes. As energy decisions and policies continue to increasingly shape the extent to which the world is impacted by climate change, we must think precisely about the complexity of identity and who is involved in energy decisions; who benefits from, and who is burdened by particular sets of energy decisions and the impacts of climate change. In addition, we must examine how these burdens and benefits manifest differently based on individual and group identities. To ignore these questions creates a research field where social actors and organizations remain decoupled from their role and responsibilities in the construction of and participation in these energy systems; where the embeddedness of a system is taken for granted, remains unscrutinized and unchallenged, and acts as a path-dependent barrier to the envisioning and building of an alternative energy future. In order to strengthen energy and climate change research and policy we must engage in research methods that can better account for underlying issues of power and justice within the decisionmaking processes across multiple socio-political scales. More specifically in this paper, I argue that using qualitative methodological tools rooted in intersectional feminist theory, such as a multi-sited critical policy ehtnography, are a crucial way to do so.","[Ryder, Stacia S.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Ryder, SS (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Stacia.s.ryder@gmail.com,,,,,,112,22,22,1,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The Supreme Court has intervened and supported strengthening of these tribunals and their evolution into entities (if not fully but certainly) more independent of the executive. This article explores these questions through a case study of the National Green Tribunal (NGT)-specifically focusing on the subject of jurisdiction. NGT is the newest of the tribunals that have been established since the Constitutional amendment was passed allowing for them. The jurisdiction of the NGT, although statutorily limited, has evolved in the light of Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the powers of tribunals. Further, the nature of environmental disputes are such that the NGT has had to expansively interpret both procedural mechanisms, such as limitation periods for allowing more disputes to be brought to the bench, and by entering into substantive areas such as climate change.","[Chowdhury, Nupur] JNU, Ctr Study Law & Governance, Delhi, India; [Srivastava, Nidhi] Independent Law & Policy Consultant, Delhi, India","Chowdhury, N (corresponding author), JNU, Ctr Study Law & Governance, Delhi, India.",,,"Chowdhury, Nupur/0000-0002-6747-0977",,,,37,0,0,1,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1385-2140,1875-8258,,ASIA PAC J ENVIRON,Asia Pac.

Growth in marine protected areas, fisheries management, the blue economy, and marine spatial planning initiatives are occurring both within and beyond national jurisdictions. This mounting activity has coincided with increasing concerns about sustainability and international attention to ocean governance. Yet, despite growing concerns about exclusionary decision-making processes and social injustices, there remains inadequate attention to issues of social justice and inclusion in ocean science, management, governance and funding. In a rapidly changing and progressively busier ocean, we need to learn from past mistakes and identify ways to navigate a just and inclusive path towards sustainability. Proactive attention to inclusive decision-making and social justice is needed across key ocean policy realms including marine conservation, fisheries management, marine spatial planning, the blue economy, climate adaptation and global ocean governance for both ethical and instrumental reasons.

However, climate and nonclimate challenges facing infrastructure are not purely technological. Ecological and social systems also warrant consideration to manage issues of overconfidence, inflexibility, interdependence, and resource utilization-among others. As a result, techno-centric adaptation strategies can result in unwanted tradeoffs, unintended consequences, and underaddressed vulnerabilities. Techno-centric strategies that lock-in today's infrastructure systems to vulnerable future design, management, and regulatory practices may be particularly problematic by exacerbating these ecological and social issues rather than ameliorating them. Given these challenges, we develop a conceptual model and infrastructure adaptation case studies to argue the following: (1) infrastructure systems are not simply technological and should be understood as complex and interconnected social, ecological, and technological systems (SETSs); (2) infrastructure challenges, like lock-in, stem from SETS interactions that are often overlooked and underappreciated; (3) framing infrastructure with a SETS lens can help identify and prevent maladaptive issues like lock-in; and (4) a SETS lens can also highlight effective infrastructure adaptation strategies that may not traditionally be considered. Ultimately, we find that treating infrastructure as SETS shows promise for increasing the adaptive capacity of infrastructure systems by highlighting how lock-in and vulnerabilities evolve and how multidisciplinary strategies can be deployed to address these challenges by broadening the options for adaptation.","[Markolf, Samuel A.; Chester, Mikhail, V] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Civil Environm & Sustainable Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Markolf, Samuel A.; Chester, Mikhail, V; Miller, Thaddeus R.] Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Eisenberg, Daniel A.] Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Operat Res, Monterrey, CA USA; [Iwaniec, David M.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Urban Studies Inst, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Davidson, Cliff, I] Syracuse Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Syracuse, NY USA; [Zimmerman, Rae] NYU, Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, Planning & Publ Adm, New York, NY USA; [Miller, Thaddeus R.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ USA; [Ruddell, Benjamin L.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Chang, Heejun] Portland State Univ, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Dept Geog, Portland, OR 97207 USA","Markolf, SA (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Civil Environm & Sustainable Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.; Markolf, SA (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",smarkolf@asu.edu,"Iwaniec, David M./M-7993-2014; Eisenberg, Daniel/R-7488-2019; Davidson, Cliff/T-8985-2019","Iwaniec, David M./0000-0002-0410-4152; Eisenberg, Daniel/0000-0003-2514-8258; Ruddell, Benjamin/0000-0003-2967-9339; Davidson, Cliff/0000-0002-6872-4094; Markolf, Samuel/0000-0003-4744-0006; Miller, Thaddeus/0000-0002-1692-5839; Chester, Mikhail/0000-0002-9354-2102; Chang, Heejun/0000-0002-5605-6500",Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (UREx SRN) under National Science Foundation [AGS-1444755],"This work is supported by the Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (UREx SRN) under National Science Foundation grant AGS-1444755.

Transitions in this literature include moving from attitudinal factors, and the infamous Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) explanation, toward place attachment, environmental justice, and how policy development might shape support for wind turbines in rural communities. While this research has advanced our understanding of some of the major questions in this area, the political arena has largely remained implicit or in the background, rather than a specific area of detailed inquiry. Addressing this gap in the literature, we detail findings from our mixed method study of interviews (n = 54) and surveys (n = 240) with local residents, developers, and other stakeholders in Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada. We focus on the interplay of partisanship and geography, and how together they can powerfully influence attitudes toward wind energy. Specifically, we extend the existing literature and argue that when parties politicize the issue of wind energy - especially within the context of an urban/rural divide - it becomes intertwined with elements of ideology which can amplify responses and further entrench local conflict.","[Walker, Chad] Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Stephenson, Laura] Western Univ, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Baxter, Jamie] Western Univ, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada","Walker, C (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",cw135@queensu.ca,"Stephenson, Laura/C-5458-2019; Walker, Chad/AAJ-5729-2020","Stephenson, Laura/0000-0003-3526-8624; ","George C.

The story of the Anthropocene is one of the contemporary narratives guiding modern sustainability initiatives, and it assumes a pan-human responsibility for the climate crisis calling for the adoption of technocratic fixes to address the problem. This is not enough, argue many environmental justice critics, who assert that the story itself is fatally flawed. Rather, they insist that the goal should be to change the story to imagine and create alternative pathways toward more just, interdependent, and sustainable futures. Instead, many environmental justice activists and scholars deploy the story of the miner's canary, a cautionary tale used as a metaphor for how the awareness of the suffering of those who are most vulnerable may provide early warning signals of imminent environmental collapse in the broader society. The miner's canary story argues that by noticing and caring for those most at risk, all communities and environments are protected. The final section of the article discusses my own story of working with community groups who see themselves as canaries in the current global crisis fueled by climate change. I describe how I engage community building across differences with the hopes of co-producing a model for a more just sustainability-or a story of a degentrified model of sustainability that insists we address in tandem the social and environmental crises of our times.","[Di Chiro, Giovanna] Swarthmore Coll, Environm Studies Program, 500 Coll Ave, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA","Di Chiro, G (corresponding author), Swarthmore Coll, Environm Studies Program, 500 Coll Ave, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",gdichir2@swarthmore.edu,,,,,,54,5,5,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

This has placed tremendous pressure on the country's natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials. Hence, the conventional means of expanding the built environment is no longer appropriate, as it has been found to be one of major causes of climate change and global warming. In the early 1970s, the principles of sustainable development emerged in developed countries, in order to remedy this global issue. During this period, Saudi Arabia experienced dramatic development in all of its industries, but the principles of sustainable development were, to a large degree, overlooked. However, there is now an ambitious Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia, one of the purposes of which is to promote greater sustainability in the country. This study seeks to assist decision makers to identify the challenges and opportunities of the current Saudi practices of city design, and their related operational aspects, and to enable the adoption of effective measures for implementing sustainable development principles. Employing an ethnographic research methodology, the fieldwork concerned includes a public perception survey, followed by a site inspection, in order to develop an insider's view of the current level of sustainable practice in the city of Najran. A public survey is distributed to well-informed citizens, with the goal of obtaining their insights, and to assess their willingness to embrace green city practices. This is followed by a site inspection visit that seeks to obtain in-depth information regarding site design and operational practices. A checklist of sustainable criteria is adapted from well-known systems. The major outcomes of the study reveal that many challenges are encountered the application of green city principles. The paper offers effective approaches and strategic actions for overcoming these challenges.","[Alyami, Saleh H.] Najran Univ, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Najran, Saudi Arabia","Alyami, SH (corresponding author), Najran Univ, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Najran, Saudi Arabia.",shalsalem@nu.edu.sa,"Alyami, Saleh H./AAN-9453-2020","Alyami, Saleh H./0000-0003-2713-5960","Najran University-Deanship of Scientific Research, KSA [NU/ESCI/16/037]","This work was supported in part by the Najran University-Deanship of Scientific Research, KSA, under Project NU/ESCI/16/037.",,41,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,178584,178595,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2959026,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KF8JT,WOS:000509483800098,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

Many nation-states around the world talk of the importance of social cohesion, and are aware of the threat of environmental degradation, climate change, and ecological well-being. However, the dominating global policy discourse, particularly championed in the West, is located within a delimiting neo/liberal political framework. With a few noticeable exceptions, the influence of neo/liberal thinking continues to flourish in the contemporary career literature where there has been little deep critical engagement with the discourse of capitalist economics and how these impact human and environmental well-being. Often caught up in market-led discourses, and captured by the notion that 'work sets you free', educational and career guidance has been located within an uncritical economic frame. Its energies tend to be directed towards the preparation of individuals to make 'good' educational and occupational choices, underpined by the need for 'clients' to acquire the skills and competencies demanded by employers (and the economy) (Bengtsson, 2011; Irving, 2018). The disjuncture between educational and career guidance and social and environmental justice (i.eec.ojustice) has rarely been breached. In this article, we seek to disrupt dominant discourses of the market that currently permeates thinking in education by identifying how an ecojustice perspective provides a forward looking and equitable foundation for educational and career guidance.","[Irving, Barrie A.] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Malik-Lievano, Beatriz] UNED, Madrid, Spain","Malik-Lievano, B (corresponding author), UNED, Madrid, Spain.",bmalik@edu.uned.es,,"Irving, Barrie/0000-0003-4650-3781",,,,42,2,2,2,3,"UNIV SEVILLA, FAC CIENCIAS EDUCACION",SEVILLA,"C/ PIROTECNIA, S-N 41013, SEVILLA, 00000, SPAIN",2172-7775,,,REV FUENTES,Rev.

The movement aroused international media attention, mass support from a wide range of individuals and environmental groups, and political debates regarding Indigenous rights, climate change, fossil fuel reliance, water protection, and corporate power. Ultimately, 10 months into the movement, it was halted by the US federal government and the pipeline was installed. During the movement, state and federal military forces worked alongside a private military and security contractor (PMSC), TigerSwan, hired by owners of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners. This case study addresses the ethics of the use of private military against Indigenous-led environmental activists at Standing Rock. Readers will review the modern rise and use of privatized militia, examine specific tactics used by TigerSwan at Standing Rock, and consider the ethics surrounding principles of transparency, accountability, regulation, and the potential risk for increased violence against citizens. A brief historical overview of Oceti Sakowin's political resistance to US federal land appropriation and corporate exploitation is provided, as well as an analysis of future implications for Indigenous-led environmental justice movements. With this case study, instructors, students, and researchers can debate and analyze the ethical dilemmas regarding the use of PMSCs to target environmental justice movements.","[Grossman, Kandice] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Grossman, K (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grossmank@mail.missouri.edu,,,,,,48,0,0,0,0,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2473-9510,,,CASE STUD ENVIRON,Case Stud.

Amidst growing panic, teenagers are emerging as key leaders and mobilizers, demanding intergenerational justice and immediate action. They are, however, often depicted as lone revolutionaries or as pawns of adult organizations. These representations obscure the complex and important ways in which climate justice movements are operating, and particularly the ways in which dynamics of age intersect with other axes of power within solidarity efforts in specific contexts. This article explores these dynamics, building on analyses of intersectional and intergenerational solidarity practices. Specifically, it delves into detailed analysis of how the Seattle group of the Raging Grannies, a network of older activists, engaged in Seattle's ShellNo Action Coalition, mobilizing their age, whiteness, and gender to support racialized and youth activists involved in the coalition, and thus to block Shell Oil's rigs from travelling through the Seattle harbour en route to the Arctic. Drawing from a pivotal group discussion between Grannies and other coalition members, as well as participant observation and media analysis, it examines the Grannies' practices of solidarity during frontline protests and well beyond. The article thus offers an analysis of solidarity that is both intergenerational and intersectional in approach, while contributing to ongoing work to extend understandings of the temporal, spatial, cognitive, and relational dimensions of solidarity praxis.","[Chazan, May; Baldwin, Melissa] Trent Univ, Peterborough, ON, Canada","Chazan, M (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Gender & Womens Studies, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada.",maychazan@trentu.ca,,,,,,52,2,2,3,4,"UNIV WINDSOR, CENTRE STUDIES SOCIAL JUSTICE",WINDSOR,"251-1 CHRYSLER HALL SOUTH, WINDSOR, ON N9B 3P4, CANADA",1911-4788,,,STUD SOC JUSTICE,Stud.

According to the framework, the deprived social groups and ethnic minorities are often more exposed to environmental risks and hazards due to their disadvantaged situation, and due to the lack of representation and political power. To manage the impacts of injustices and to include the citizen in the decision-making processes, proper information is needed on local attitudes and decision-making processes. Therefore, this study sought to (i) identify the main factors shaping the attitudes towards environmental injustices and (ii) to analyse the attitudes and perception of the various social groups and (iii) to identify the main factors which are shaping the attitudes and actions of those who were affected by the floods of 2001 and 2010 through the use of decision tree method. The data for the predictive model was acquired from a questionnaire survey conducted in two disadvantaged and flood-hit Hungarian regions. Based on the survey data, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted, which resulted in three principal components; fear, social change, and change in the built environment. The study focused only on the elements of the fear principal component, due to the decision tree tool homogenous groups identified in relation to this component. Our analysis showed that ethnicity has a determinative role in the emergence and the level of fear from floods; the Roma respondents expressed a significantly higher level of fear than others.","[Nagy, Gyula; Vida, Gyorgy; Boros, Lajos] Univ Szeged, Dept Econ & Social Geog, Egyet Utca 2, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary; [Ciric, Danijela] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia","Nagy, G (corresponding author), Univ Szeged, Dept Econ & Social Geog, Egyet Utca 2, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary.",eo.nagy.gyula@gmail.com,"Ciric, Danijela/AAK-5305-2020; Boros, Lajos/L-9600-2018; Vida, Gyorgy/L-8910-2018","Ciric, Danijela/0000-0002-4834-6487; Boros, Lajos/0000-0003-3241-7778; Vida, Gyorgy/0000-0003-0526-1384","Ministry of Human Capacities, Hungary [203913/2018/FEKUSTRAT]","This research was supported by the Ministry of Human Capacities, Hungary grant 203913/2018/FEKUSTRAT",,61,2,2,1,1,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2391-5447,,,OPEN GEOSCI,Open Geosci.,JAN,2019,11,1,,,,,1025,1034,,10.1515/geo-2019-0079,,,10,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geology,KC5XQ,WOS:000507250700001,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

The traditional interpretation of the poem has focused on the paradigm that the Lutheran reformation resulted in a great decline in Icelandic society and culture. The article examines whether or not the poet adhered to this understanding. It is argued that the poem is largely religious and shaped by Lutheran theology. The poet also asserts that a great decline has occurred in the church life of the nation as well as in other domains. In particular, he thinks that social justice has declined and churches and graveyards have been neglected. The problems he describes can mostly be explained by changes in climate (the Little Ice Age), volcanic eruptions and plagues. The poet also criticizes the growing contrasts between the poor and the rich, which can be explained by the fact that property was concentrated among fewer families when the population of the country decreased.","[Hugason, Hjalti] Kirkjusogu Haskoli Isl, Aoalbygging, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland","Hugason, H (corresponding author), Kirkjusogu Haskoli Isl, Aoalbygging, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland.",,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,ARNI MAGNUSSON INSTITUTE ICELANDIC STUDIES,REYKJAVIK,"ARNAGARDUR, SUDURGATA, REYKJAVIK, 101, ICELAND",1018-5011,,,GRIPLA,Gripla,,2019,30,,,,,,245,277,,,,,33,"Literature, German, Dutch, Scandinavian; Medieval & Renaissance Studies",Literature; Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,JZ2RB,WOS:000504950300008,,,,,2021-08-07,

Educational responses and tools must be part of mitigation and adaptation policis in the face of the climate crisis, as recognized in international organizations and declarations. This challenge forces us to rethink the ethical framework of educational praxis to question the environmental and social sustainability of the core values that have guided human development since the beginning of modernity. The climate crisis radically questions the identification between growth and development. It also shows that the eco-dependent condition of our species has been ignored for the sake of a notion of progress based on the scientific-technical capacity to manage the biosphere without considering its biophysical limits. The climate policy articulated so far has barely considered the ethical and social dimensions of global warming and, moreover, has been objectively ineffective. The climate threat poses challenges of synchronous justice, derived from the differential responsibility in its causes of each society and the different vulnerability to its consequences of human groups with fewer resources for self-protection. And it poses diachronic justice challenges, to the extent that an overheated planet will limit the possibilities of younger generations and those that are to come, to have a decent life. The timing of the climate crisis forces an urgent and emergency educational action, which places this problem at the climate of the curriculum and of the educational practices outside the educational system. Moral controversy must be a central element in an Education for Climate Change whose ethical and practical imperative is the decarbonization of societies and lifestyles, from the individual scale to the global scale.","[Caride Gomez, Jose Antonio; Meira Cartea, Pablo Angel] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Pedag & Didact, Santiago De Compostela, Spain","Gomez, JAC (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Pedag & Didact, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",joseantonio.caride@usc.es; pablo.meira@usc.es,"Meira-Cartea, Pablo Angel/G-2631-2016","Meira-Cartea, Pablo Angel/0000-0003-0194-7477",,,,43,0,0,1,7,UNIV SANTIAGO COMPOSTELA,SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,"SERVICIO DE PUBLICACIONES E INTERCAMBIO CIENTIFICO, CAMPUS UNIV SUR, SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, 15782, SPAIN",1130-8656,2340-0056,,INNOV EDUC-SPAIN,Innov.

The article analyzes the main problems of nature use, typical for steppe regions of Russia at a modern geoecological state of landscapes. The transboundary character of the territory under consideration is noted and the evolution of its landscapes under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors, which make the study of the issues of rational use of natural resources and sustainable development of steppe regions actual, is described. The attention is focused on the significant participation of the mesoregion under consideration, which has the main share of the area of spread of black earths, in the production of agricultural products and strategic importance for the sustainable functioning of the Russian economy. Correlation-regression relations of the main ecological factors with productivity of grain agrocenoses are analyzed and ecologically oriented methods of increasing the efficiency of bioclimatic resources use of the mentioned territory are substantiated.

This paper analyzes socio-ecological complexity and territorial limits as themes of enduring relevance in official responses to the Inuit Circumpolar Council's and Maldives' foundational legal claims that climate change violates human rights, considering these against the backdrop of evolving understanding of responsibility for climate-related harm in scientific, political, and public discourse. The claims demonstrated that when legal analysis integrates scientific and traditional knowledge, climate change can be seen as violating rights internationally, and identifiable actors as culpable. Respondents disagreed, citing the complexity of climate-related harm, which combines multiple human actors, environmental processes, probability, prediction, and extraterritorial impact. Unresolved gaps between these interpretations raise doubts about law's relevance to growing global inequities of climate change and other processes that mix people, places, and things.","[Derman, Brandon B.] Univ Illinois, Environm Studies, One Univ Plaza, Springfield, IL 62703 USA","Derman, BB (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Environm Studies, One Univ Plaza, Springfield, IL 62703 USA.",bderm2@uis.edu,,,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1129127],This work is based in part on research supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation [grant number 1129127].

Reduction of plastic waste generation is one of the main solutions offered to remedy the plastic waste problem. However, it is undeniable that plastics play a significant role in benefiting humanity. Plastic medical devices save lives, household equipment and vehicle components are lighter and more fuel efficient. Conventional plastics are produced from virgin fossil feedstocks (oil and natural gas), and their carbon footprint is contributing to the problem of climate change. However, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories generally report that emissions related to global waste management may not be as high as other GHG sources, i.e. electricity generation from fossil fuel combustion or transportation, concluding that innovative approaches in the waste management sector may not substantially contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. This paper examines near or long term technical and policy changes needed that can support environmental health, mitigate climate change, and promote social justice by feeding plastic waste back into the circular carbon economy.","[Guran, Serpil] Rutgers State Univ, EcoComplex, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Guran, S (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, EcoComplex, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",Serpil.guran@rutgers.edu,,,,,,38,0,0,3,12,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2372-0344,2372-0352,,AIMS ENVIRON SCI,AIMS Environ.

Recently, a well-known Chinese green non-governmental organisation - Friends of Nature - brought a claim against Gansu Subsidiary of the State Power Grid for its refusal to fully purchase clean electricity generated from renewable generators. The claim was dismissed. However, it opened up a door for climate change/energy litigation. This article explores the contributions and potential barriers confronted by environment courts in climate change litigation. Although environment courts have made laudable achievements towards climate justice, climate change litigation is handicapped by conceptual failure and exposes participants (litigants and judges) to unnecessary uncertainties that environment courts find difficult to resolve.","[Chen, Zhou] Xiamen Univ, Sch Law, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China","Chen, Z (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Law, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,,,"China Scholarship Council (CSC), LLM of the Research Institute of Environmental Law (RIEL), Wuhan University; Kick-Starting Research Fund of the CSC","Assistant Professor, School of Law, Xiamen University; PhD at Tilburg University funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC), LLM of the Research Institute of Environmental Law (RIEL), Wuhan University.

First, it aims at providing a sound normative foundation for carbon pricing mechanisms around the notions of a 'right to energy', the 'duty not-to-harm' and an argument for 'restricted compensation'. Second, it identifies the normative elements from theories of climate justice that should guide the design of market-based instruments for climate change mitigation.

However, environmental agencies and other reporters often disseminate this critical data only in siloed repositories and in technically complex, inconsistent formats, limiting its impact. We have developed a new open source web resource, the Archive of Massachusetts ENvironmental Data or AMEND, which curates information relating to federal, state, and local environmental stewardship in Massachusetts, focused on water quality. We describe the construction of AMEND, its operation, and the datasets we have integrated to date. This tool supports the development and advocacy of policy positions with published analyses that are fully reproducible, versioned, and archived online. As a case study, we present the first publicly reported analysis of the distributional impact of combined sewer overflows on Environmental Justice (EJ) communities. Our analysis of the historical geospatial distribution of these sewer overflows and block-level US Census data on EJ indicators tracking race, income, and linguistic isolation demonstrates that vulnerable communities in Massachusetts are significantly overburdened by this form of pollution. We discuss applications of this analysis to the state-level legislative process in Massachusetts. We believe that this approach to increasing the accessibility of regulatory data, and the code underlying AMEND, can serve as a model for other civic organizations seeking to leverage data to build trust with and advocate to policymakers and the public.","[Sanders, Nathan Edward] Myst River Watershed Assoc, Arlington, MA 02476 USA","Sanders, NE (corresponding author), Myst River Watershed Assoc, Arlington, MA 02476 USA.",openamend@gmail.com,,,,,,62,1,1,0,3,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2019,7,3,,,,,91,103,,10.17645/mac.v7i3.2136,,,13,Communication,Communication,IN9GC,WOS:000478986100005,,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

Second, CDSC must be informed by past research about what citizens in the global South know about climate change and how awareness impacts action. Finally, scholars should be guided by the lessons from past climate change-focused CDSC initiatives. As an example, a multistakeholder climate change action campaign in Kenya is examined.

In this country, news reporting of environmental issues is vibrant and vigorous, although it attracts scant scholarly attention. In fact, environmental journalism in this South Asian country is one of the least studied topics in the area of journalism research. The current study attends to this country and examines news sources in two newspapers in Bangladesh, focusing on their coverage of river systems and climate change in 2009 and 2015. This study explores various sources, such as politicians, bureaucrats, activists, and citizens, and the patterns of emphasis in the news by using these sources to understand the framing of river degradation and climate change. The aim here is to illustrate the journalists' influence in defining these environmental problems against various news sources and social actors. The qualitative analysis reveals an emphasis on political and bureaucratic sources in 2009 and on expert and citizen sources in 2015. Additionally, the analysis also demonstrates that the journalists-as actors in defining the reality-have exerted 'influence' on accentuating environmental concerns by shifting their source emphasis over time from politicians and bureaucrats to experts and citizens. Through this emphasis, they uphold the discourse of environmental justice in varied contexts.","[Das, Jahnnabi] Univ Technol Sydney, Social & Polit Sci Programme, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Das, J (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Social & Polit Sci Programme, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Jahnnabi.Das@uts.edu.au,,,,,,57,1,1,1,2,"AUCKLAND UNIV TECHNOLOGY, CREATIVE INDUSTRIES RESEARCH INST",AUCKLAND,"55 WELLESLEY ST E, AUCKLAND, 1020, NEW ZEALAND",1023-9499,2324-2035,,PAC JOURNAL REV,Pac.

Design/methodology/approach Peer-reviewed scholarly materials, carefully vetted for empirical worth, for the clarity and soundness of their research methodologies, and for their capacity to account for confounding or complicating factors, are reviewed. Special attention is given to studies, found in academic databases such as EBSCOHost, conducted in the years 2013-2018. Findings The Mexican state has finally made some progress in recognizing the hurdles women face in attaining educational equality, but there is not yet the universal application and comity that would ensure appropriate levels of representation in all communities. Mexico will have to do more to compel local actors to give greater credence to the voices of women. Research limitations/implications There is a need for further primary research to more comprehensively capture what actions women are taking to carve out a large policy-making space for themselves in a country that has only quite recently begun to realize the contributions women can make to forward-looking water governance policy. Originality/value The uneasy confluence between water governance and gender within the Mexican context is an area of growing concern to those interested in how water management systems and protocols shape broader social justice and equality developments across Mexico.","[Rodriguez de San Miguel, Jorge Alejandro Silva] Inst Politecn Nacl, CIIEMAD, Dept Terr & Ambiente, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","de San Miguel, JASR (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, CIIEMAD, Dept Terr & Ambiente, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",j.a.silva@outlook.com,"de San Miguel, Jorge Alejandro Silva Rodriguez/D-3308-2016","de San Miguel, Jorge Alejandro Silva Rodriguez/0000-0002-0961-4696","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado, Instituto Politecnico Nacional (Genero y gobernanza del agua en Mexico) [20180538]","This study was supported by Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado, Instituto Politecnico Nacional (20180538: Genero y gobernanza del agua en Mexico).",,79,1,1,2,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

Present human interaction, with his environment, is clearly unsustainable due to the ruthless and imbalanced act of consumption of natural resources sans any parallel thought of nurturing the environment or protecting the interests of future generations. Against this backdrop, this paper argues that the notion of justice can play a pivotal role in understanding the idea of sustainable development. It concludes that the notion of sustainability can be envisaged, in the course of a critical analysis of John Rawls's theory of justice, as justice as fairness, a concept that contains sustainable behavior as a pertinent trait.","[Singh, Mayavee] Goa Univ, Dept Philosophy, Taleigao, Goa, India","Singh, M (corresponding author), Goa Univ, Dept Philosophy, Taleigao, Goa, India.",mayaveesingh@gmail.com,,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,POLITECHNIKA LUBELSKA,LUBLIN,"WYDZIAL INZYNIERII SRODOWSKA, UL NADBYSTRZYCKA 40 B, LUBLIN, 20-618, POLAND",1895-6912,,,PROBL EKOROZW,Probl.

The central problem addressed is how idealised normative theories can be relevant to the political process of negotiating a just distribution of the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change. I distinguish three possible responses, that is, three kinds of non-ideal theories of climate justice: focused on (1) the injustice of some agents not doing their part; (2) the policy process and aiming to be realistic; and (3) grievances related to the transition to a clean-energy economy. The methodological discussion underpinning each response is innovative and should be of interest more generally, even though it is still underdeveloped. The practical upshot, however, is unclear: even non-ideal climate justice may be too disconnected from the fast-moving and messy climate circus.","[Brandstedt, Eric] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CPNSS, London, England","Brandstedt, E (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CPNSS, London, England.",e.brandstedt@lse.ac.uk,,"Brandstedt, Eric/0000-0001-6671-3802",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [437-2014-6692],This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council [grant number 437-2014-6692].,,27,4,4,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8230,1743-8772,,CRIT REV INT SOC POL,Crit.

I draw upon my lived experience as a Lumbee person and my training as an environmental scientist to evaluate the riverine environment of the Lumbee River as both a template for change and a fragile resource. The river shapes Lumbee culture and community, on the one hand, and it is subject to human impacts, on the other. Here, I examine the bidirectional relationship between river and people in a historical context and also in the context of contemporary issues facing Lumbee people, who collectively make up one of the largest Indigenous groups in the United States and constitute the nation's largest non-federally recognized Indian tribe. I frame historical issues related to isolation and connectivity of the landscape around a novel topological analysis of historical maps. I use contemporary issues, including industrialized agriculture and climate change, to emphasize the complex and evolving relationship between Lumbee people and their riverine environment. Recent events, including Indigenous resistance to fossil fuel pipelines and flooding of the community following Hurricane Matthew, reveal challenges and opportunities faced by the tribe in the areas of environmental justice and sovereignty.","[Emanuel, Ryan E.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Ecohydrol & Watershed Sci Res Grp, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Emanuel, RE (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Ecohydrol & Watershed Sci Res Grp, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,"Emanuel, Ryan E/C-3796-2012","Emanuel, Ryan E/0000-0002-2166-1698",,,,38,5,5,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1084-5453,1930-8892,,ENVIRON HIST-US,Environ.

This potential collateral damage has prompted calls for a just transition to a green economy. While the term, just transition, is increasingly prevalent in the public discourse, it remains under-discussed and poorly defined in legal literature, preventing it from helping catalyze fair decarbonization. This Article seeks to define the term, test its validity, and articulate its relationship with law so the idea can meet its potential. The Article is the first to disambiguate and assess two main rhetorical usages of just transition. I argue that legal scholars should recognize it as a term of art that evolved in the labor movement, first known as a superfund for workers. In the climate change context, I therefore define a just transition as the principle of easing the burden decarbonization poses to those who depend on high-carbon industries. This definition provides clarity and can help law engage with fields that already recognize just transitions as a labor concept. I argue further that the labor-driven just transition concept is both justified and essential in light of today's deep political polarization and jobs-versus-environment tensions. First, it can incorporate much-needed economic equity considerations into environmental decisionmaking. Second, it can inform a modernized alternative to the environmental law apparatus, which must evolve to transcend disciplines. Third, it offers an avenue for climate reform through coalition-building between labor and environmental interests. I offer guidance for effectuating the principle by synthesizing instances of its embodiment in law in the Trade Act of 1974 (assisting manufacturing communities), the President's Northwest Forest Plan (assisting timber communities), the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (assisting tobacco farmers), and the POWER Initiative (assisting coal communities), among other examples.","[Eisenberg, Ann M.] Univ South Carolina, Sch Law, Law, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Eisenberg, AM (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Law, Law, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",,,,,,,251,2,2,0,12,UNIV SOUTHERN CALIF,LOS ANGELES,"LAW CENTER UNIV PARK, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089-0071 USA",0038-3910,,,SOUTH CALIF LAW REV,South.

Drawing on existing literature, interviews and field visit observations, I consider how and why Etetung is proving increasingly important in local efforts toward cultural sustainability and climate justice (social justice as it relates to climate change). Specifically, I focus on three ways in which community members are employing the practice of Etetung to progress both climate justice and cultural sustainability concerns: first, through the use of Etetung to maintain and transmit cultural and environmental knowledge; second, through featuring Etetung in cultural tourism; and third, through drawing on Etetung to enable greater participation in the regional and international climate change discourse. As such, this article presents and reflects on one multifaceted approach to advancing dual cultural sustainability and climate justice interests, with potential relevance to other contexts in the Pacific and beyond.","[Grant, Catherine] Griffith Univ, Mus Literature & Res, Queensland Conservatorium, Nathan, Qld, Australia","Grant, C (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Queensland Conservatorium, South Bank Campus,POB 3428, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia.",catherine.grant@griffith.edu.au,"Grant, Catherine/AAW-1716-2020","Grant, Catherine/0000-0003-2952-8426",Griffith University Arts Education Law New Researcher Grant,CThis research was funded by a Griffith University Arts Education Law New Researcher Grant (2017).,,46,3,3,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1444-2213,1740-9314,,ASIA PAC J ANTHROPOL,Asia Pac.

R.",,,Social justice implications of US managed retreat buyout programs,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY; RECONSTRUCTION; ADAPTATION; KATRINA,"Global climate change poses significant risks to coastal and riverine communities. Managed retreat, the purposeful movement of people and infrastructure out of vulnerable floodplains, is one possible adaptation strategy. The USA has already engaged in a limited amount of retreat by providing federal funds to purchase and demolish or relocate vulnerable properties. As retreat programs are expected to expand in size and frequency to address the increased risks posed by climate change, a review of how such property acquisition programs have been implemented is timely. Specifically, decisions made by government officials regarding where to acquire properties have significant potential social justice implications, as buyouts could promote or reduce existing social inequities, but it is unclear how such decisions are being made. A review of eight US buyout programs suggests that buyouts, as practiced, lack transparency, which may increase public distrust of the process and reduce participation. Moreover, decisions often involve political motivations and rely on cost-benefit logic that may promote disproportionate retreat in low-income or minority communities, continuing historic patterns of social inequity. However, as low-income communities in the USA also tend to be highly vulnerable to climate-exacerbated hazards, a decision not to relocate may also promote disproportionate harm. The buyout programs reviewed provide examples of how to mitigate these concerns through increased transparency, emphasis on relocation, explicit focus on social inequality, longer-term and larger-scale holistic approaches, and participatory pre-disaster planning. Further research on past programs is needed to evaluate outcomes and processes to improve future adaptation efforts.","[Siders, A.

In this context, recent scholarly attention has been paid to gentrification, real-estate speculation and resident displacement in the context of sustainability and green planning in the global North. Yet we know little about the environmental-justice implications of green infrastructure planning in the context of self-built settlements of the global South. To what extent do green infrastructure interventions produce or exacerbate urban socio-spatial inequities in self-built settlements? Through the analysis of a greenbelt project, an emblematic case of green infrastructure planning in Medellin, we argue that, as the Municipality of Medellin is containing and beautifying low-income neighborhoods through grabbing part of their territories and turning them into green landscapes of privilege and pleasure, communities are becoming dispossessed of their greatest assets-location, land and social capital. In the process, community land is transformed into a new form of aesthetically controlled and ordered nature for the middle and upper classes and for tourists. By contrast, communities' planning alternatives reveal how green planning can better address growth and climate risks in tandem with equitable community development.","[Anguelovski, Isabelle] ICREA, Passeig Lluis Companys 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Irazabal-Zurita, Clara] Univ Missouri Kansas City, Architecture Urban Planning & Design, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Connolly, James J.

With a growing population projected to occur in the Boston metropolitan area, more socially vulnerable groups are likely to bear the burdens from climate change-induced hazards. Understanding the interlinked relationship between social and ecological vulnerability is critical to understand the resilience of social-ecological systems in communities. This paper aims to provide a social-ecological assessment framework that serves as a resilience planning tool to inform growth management and incorporate EcoWisdom for climate justice planning. This study employed a Social-Ecological Vulnerability Matrix to examine climate justice hotspots where social vulnerability intersects with ecological vulnerability of a place in the Charles River Watershed. Four climate change scenarios derived from a climate sensitivity study were investigated. The results provided implications for four planning strategies corresponding to the four quadrates of the matrix. This paper demonstrated a planning tool to inform policies for enhancing resilience under a range of climate change impacts and to integrate equity planning for local climate justice.","[Cheng, Chingwen] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA","Cheng, CW (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",chingwen.cheng@asu.edu,,"Cheng, Chingwen/0000-0002-9724-2190",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-0948984]; USDA (Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station) [MAS009584]; US Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Massachusetts Water Resources Research Center,"This project was part of the Boston Metro Area Urban Long-Term Research Area-Exploratory (BMA ULTRA-ex) project managed by Co-PIs: Dr. Paige S.

Supported by growing scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change amplifying frequency, intensity and duration of climate-related hazards as well as observed increases in climate-related impacts and risks in many regions, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage was established in 2013 and further supported through the Paris Agreement in 2015. Despite advances, the debate currently is broad, diffuse and somewhat confusing, while concepts, methods and tools, as well as directions for policy remain vague and often contested. This book, a joint effort of the Loss and Damage Network-a partnership effort by scientists and practitioners from around the globe-provides evidence-based insight into the L&D discourse by highlighting state-of-the-art research conducted across multiple disciplines, by showcasing applications in practice and by providing insight into policy contexts and salient policy options. This introductory chapter summarises key findings of the twenty-two book chapters in terms of five propositions. These propositions, each building on relevant findings linked to forward-looking suggestions for research, policy and practice, reflect the architecture of the book, whose sections proceed from setting the stage to critical issues, followed by a section on methods and tools, to chapters that provide geographic perspectives, and finally to a section that identifies potential policy options. The propositions comprise (1) Risk management can be an effective entry point for aligning perspectives and debates, if framed comprehensively, coupled with climate justice considerations and linked to established risk management and adaptation practice; (2) Attribution science is advancing rapidly and fundamental to informing actions to minimise, avert, and address losses and damages; (3) Climate change research, in addition to identifying physical/hard limits to adaptation, needs to more systematically examine soft limits to adaptation, for which we find some evidence across several geographies globally; (4) Climate risk insurance mechanisms can serve the prevention and cure aspects emphasised in the L&D debate but solidarity and accountability aspects need further attention, for which we find tentative indication in applications around the world; (5) Policy deliberations may need to overcome the perception that L&D constitutes a win-lose negotiation game by developing a more inclusive narrative that highlights collective ambition for tackling risks, mutual benefits and the role of transformation.","[Mechler, Reinhard; Calliari, Elisa; Bouwer, Laurens M.; Schinko, Thomas; Surminski, Swenja; Linnerooth-Bayer, JoAnne; Aerts, Jeroen; Botzen, Wouter; Boyd, Emily; Deckard, Natalie Delia; Fuglestvedt, Jan S.; Gonzalez-Eguino, Mikel; Haasnoot, Marjolijn; Handmer, John; Haque, Masroora; Heslin, Alison; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan; Huggel, Christian; Huq, Saleemul; James, Rachel; Jones, Richard G.; Juhola, Sirkku; Keating, Adriana; Kienberger, Stefan; Kreft, Soenke; Kuik, Onno; Landauer, Mia; Laurien, Finn; Lawrence, Judy; Lopez, Ana; Liu, Wei; Magnuszewski, Piotr; Markandya, Anil; Mayer, Benoit; McCallum, Ian; McQuistan, Colin; Meyer, Lukas; Mintz-Woo, Kian; Montero-Colbert, Arianna; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Nalau, Johanna; Noy, Ilan; Oakes, Robert; Otto, Friederike E.

Yet, negotiations under the UNFCCC are caught between demands for climate justice, understood as compensation, for increases in extreme and slow-onset event risk, and the reluctance of other parties to consider Loss and Damage outside of an adaptation framework. Working towards a jointly acceptable position we suggest an actionable way forward for the deliberations may be based on aligning comprehensive climate risk analytics with distributive and compensatory justice considerations. Our proposed framework involves in a short-medium term, needs-based perspective support for climate risk management beyond countries ability to absorb risk. In a medium-longer term, liability-based perspective we particularly suggest to consider liabilities attributable to anthropogenic climate change and associated impacts. We develop the framework based on principles of need and liability, and identify the policy space for Loss and Damage as composed of curative and transformative measures. Transformative measures, such as managed retreat, have already received attention in discussions on comprehensive climate risk management. Curative action is less clearly defined, and more contested. Among others, support for a climate displacement facility could qualify here. For both sets of measures, risk financing (such as 'climate insurance') emerges as an entry point for further policy action, as it holds potential for both risk management as well as compensation functions. To quantify the Loss and Damage space for specific countries, we suggest as one option to build on a risk layering approach that segments risk and risk interventions according to risk tolerance. An application to fiscal risks in Bangladesh and at the global scale provides an estimate of countries' financial support needs for dealing with intolerable layers of flood risk. With many aspects of Loss and Damage being of immaterial nature, we finally suggest that our broad risk and justice approach in principle can also see application to issues such as migration and preservation of cultural heritage.","[Schinko, Thomas; Mechler, Reinhard; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Mechler, Reinhard] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria","Schinko, T (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria.",schinko@iiasa.ac.at,,,,,,75,8,8,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2510-1390,2510-1404,978-3-319-72026-5; 978-3-319-72025-8,CLIM RISK MANAGE POL,,,2019,,,,,,,83,110,,10.1007/978-3-319-72026-5_4,10.1007/978-3-319-72026-5,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BQ0HE,WOS:000571983800007,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2021-08-07,

However, vulnerable communities do not fully benefit from existing technology, whereas they are disproportionally impacted by climate change. This chapter assesses how technology can shape limits to adaptation and how to report on this injustice as part of key global agreements. We develop an access, use and innovation of technology framework. As a case on a relevant technology, we test it on transboundary early warning systems in South Asia. We find that only a limited set of the state-of-the-art technologies available globally is accessed and used. Insufficient capacity and funding result in the bare minimum, largely copycat type of technology. As climate change progresses, demands on technology increase, whereas, if no action is taken, the technology remains the same widening the adaptation deficit. A better understanding of the crossover from disaster risk reduction to climate adaptation and the emerging policy domain of loss and damage allows trade-offs in terms of reducing risks through greater investment in technologies for adaptation versus absorbing risks and then financing curative or transformative loss and damage measures. We argue that attention to especially distributive, compensatory and procedural climate justice principles, in terms of distributing technology, building capacity and providing finance, can help to motivate support for widening the technology spectrum available to developing countries. We propose as part of comprehensive risk management that, first, an inventory should be developed how of technologies shape soft and hard adaptation limits. Second, technology for climate justice might be included in the adaptation communications to support reporting on the expected and experienced impact of measures on loss and damage, at a sufficiently disaggregated level. Third, soft adaptation limits should be levelled by making technology research, innovation and design equitable between those countries having capacity and those not, recognising the commitment to leave no one behind.","[van den Homberg, Marc; McQuistan, Colin] Pract Act, Rugby, England","van den Homberg, M (corresponding author), Pract Act, Rugby, England.",marcjchr@gmail.com; colin.mcquistan@practicalaction.org.uk,,,Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance,"The Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance supported this work.

Trang An exemplifies the rise of ecotourism in Vietnam as a solution to the country's need for both economic growth and environmental protection, while responding to climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges. Located in an area undergoing peri-urbanization, Trang An contributes to the fostering of a 'greener' urban development pattern while providing local communities with less climate-sensitive livelihoods. However, new vulnerabilities emerge from this transition as a result of redefined power relations and differential access to resources. Our critical approach provides a more nuanced picture of a project that is often represented as a success story. While pitfalls are inevitable in such a transformational project, the lived experience of local residents reveals the complex, elusive, and inefficient governance between the various stakeholders on the management level and begs troubling questions about environmental and social justice.","[Hoang, Thao] Teach Vietnam, 216 My Hoang Quarter,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Pulliat, Gwenn] Univ Montpellier 3, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, UMR Art Dev, CNRS, Route Mende, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France","Pulliat, G (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 3, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, UMR Art Dev, CNRS, Route Mende, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France.",thaohoang5915@gmail.com; gwenn.pulliat@cnrs.fr,,,,,,55,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2365-757X,2365-7588,978-3-319-98968-6; 978-3-319-98967-9,URBAN BOOK SERIES,,,2019,,,,,,,179,199,,10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6_9,10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6,,21,Environmental Studies; Geography; Urban Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Urban Studies,BQ9GS,WOS:000624512100010,,,,,2021-08-07,

Urban vegetation is characterized three ways in the analysis (mixed vegetation, woody vegetation, and public parks), to reflect the variable ecosystem services provided by different types of urban vegetation. Data are analyzed at the block group and census tract levels using Spearman's correlations and spatial autoregressive models. There is a strong positive correlation between urban vegetation and higher education and income across most cities. Negative correlations between racialized minority status and urban vegetation are observed but are weaker and less common in multivariate analyses that include additional variables such as education, income, and population density. Park area is more equitably distributed than mixed and woody vegetation, although inequities exist across all cities and vegetation types. The study finds that education and income are most strongly associated with urban vegetation distribution but that various other factors contribute to patterns of urban vegetation distribution, with specific patterns of inequity varying by local context. These results highlight the importance of different urban vegetation measures and suggest potential solutions to the problem of urban green inequity. Cities can use our results to inform decision making focused on improving environmental justice in urban settings.","[Nesbitt, Lorien; Meitner, Michael J.; Sheppard, Stephen R.

The marine environment is increasingly busy, changing, and a site of degradation, marginalization, injustice, contestation and conflict over declining resources and occupied spaces at local to global scales. Themes of political ecology, such as power and politics, narratives and knowledge, scale and history, environmental justice and equity, are thus salient issues to understand in ocean and coastal governance and management. This subject review examines research on these themes of political ecology in the ocean and coastal environment and reflects on how the insights gained might be applied to governance and management. Political ecology provides important insights into: the influence of power in ocean management and governance processes; the manner in which narratives, knowledge, and scale are used to legitimize and shape policies and management efforts; the effects of historical trajectories on present circumstances, options, and practices; and the nature of inequities and environmental injustices that can occur in the marine environment. Moreover, ocean and coastal researchers, practitioners, and decision makers ought to engage with the political processes and injustices occurring in the ocean. Moving from critical insights to constructive engagements will ensure that political ecology helps to plant seeds of hope in the Anthropocene ocean.","[Bennett, Nathan J.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bennett, Nathan J.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bennett, Nathan J.] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France; [Bennett, Nathan J.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Bennett, NJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Bennett, NJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",bennett@ubc.ca,"Bennett, Nathan J/ABG-6787-2020","Bennett, Nathan J/0000-0003-4852-3401",OceanCanada Partnership through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada,NJB was funded by a postdoctoral fellowship provided by the OceanCanada Partnership through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada during the writing of this article.

However, less consideration has been given to how those seeking green economy employment contribute to the environmental knowledge about the green economy and green jobs. As part of the regard for social inclusion in the green economy, scholars and policy makers have given less consideration to how marginalized workers (such as racialized immigrants) seeking employment in the green economy in developed countries negotiate their understandings of the environment. In an effort to address this gap in the framing of green economy discourses, this paper uses an environmental justice framework to examine how racialized immigrants perceive environmentalism and how it aligns with the green economy labor market. Drawing on the findings of 'The Green Gap: Toward Inclusivity in Toronto's Green Economy' study, this paper addresses the consequences of shared or different understandings of environmental knowledge in terms of the impact for the green economy labor market and recommendations for how to move toward social inclusion in green economy discourses by including diverse approaches to environmental knowledge.","[Teelucksingh, Cheryl] Ryerson Univ, Sociol Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada","Teelucksingh, C (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Sociol Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada.",teeluck@ryerson.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,54,1,1,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

CBIs can also be integrated into the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) agenda. The paper explores the extent to which CBIs promote the mainstreaming of CCA into DRR. Primary data were obtained from interviews with representatives of CBIs and supporting organisations in three local governments of the Hunter Valley (New South Wales, Australia). Findings show that CBIs recognise the potential contribution of climate change in modifying the local hazard profile. CBIs mainstream CCA into DRR by following four approaches: environmental and social justice; sustainability and transition; ecosystem-based approach; and adaptive planning. Partnerships were identified both among CBIs and between CBIs and City Councils; however, conflicts between CBIs, City Councils and business actors emerged, and a lack of commitment by multi-level governments in responding to climate change was revealed. The findings show that CBIs consider CCA and DRR within a broad everyday context related to vulnerability and local development. But we argue that assigning responsibility for climate change issues to CBIs is not a panacea and should not be the only local climate change response. Instead, CBIs need to be included in a larger and long-term commitment by actors that possess access to resources, such as higher levels of government. The paper provides a local Australian perspective on the effectiveness of mainstreaming CCA into DRR and furthers the conversation for the benefit of other communities facing similar challenges.","[Forino, Giuseppe; Brewer, Graham] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [von Meding, Jason] Univ Florida, Florida Inst Built Environm Resilience, Gainesville, FL USA","Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",g.forino@gmail.com,,"forino, giuseppe/0000-0001-6659-0742",University of Newcastle (Australia),"The Authors warmly express their gratitude to all the participants and the key informants who dedicated time to this research.

Assessing this distinction is of vital importance to assign liabilities and responsibilities in pollution cases and for designing the best policy and management actions. In this context, actors interested in downplaying the role of certain drivers of human-induced salinization can attempt to neglect its importance by referring to natural salinization, in a similar fashion to other pollution and health-related cases, fromtobacco smoke to climate change. Potash mining, which has experienced continued growth during the last decades and is a significant contributor to salinization, is prone to originate such controversies because natural salinization from the saline geological catch can be mixed with salinization produced by mining waste such as brines and mine tailings, thus obscuring the distinction between causes. By reviewing the long-standing social and environmental conflict caused by potash mining in a region of Mediterranean climate-the Llobregat river basin-in this article, we highlight the importance of the impacts of salinization on human health and provide a critical social science perspective on salinization processes.","[Gorostiza, Santiago] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencies & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain; [Sauri, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Bellaterra, Catalunya, Spain","Gorostiza, S (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencies & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain.",santiago.gorostiza@uab.cat,"Gorostiza, Santiago/K-7308-2014","Gorostiza, Santiago/0000-0002-8516-5642",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the 'Maria de Maeztu' programme for Units of Excellence [MDM-2015-0552],S.G. acknowledges the financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the 'Maria de Maeztu' programme for Units of Excellence (grant no.

An expanding body of scholarship examines the evolving discursive space in which issues facing Indigenous peoples are treated, with a predominant focus on decision outcomes of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). To understand the opportunities and constraints for meaningful participation of Indigenous peoples in international climate policy making, this article examines the experiences of Indigenous participants in the UNFCCC. We present findings from semistructured interviews with key informants, showing that material constraints and the designation of Indigenous peoples as nonstate observers continue to pose challenges for participants. Tokenism and a lack of meaningful recognition further constrain participation. Nevertheless, networks of resource sharing, coordination, and support organized among Indigenous delegates alleviate some of the impacts of constraints. Additionally, multistakeholder alliances and access to presidencies and high-level state delegates provide opportunities for international and national agenda-setting. The space available for Indigenous participation in the UNFCCC is larger than formal rules dictate but depends on personal relationships and political will. As the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform established by the Paris Agreement formalizes a distinct space for Indigenous participants in the UNFCCC, this article outlines existing opportunities and constraints and considers potential interactions between the evolving platform and existing mechanisms for participation.","[Belfer, Ella] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Energy & Resources, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Belfer, Ella] McGill Univ, Climate Change Adaptat Res Grp, Indigenous Communities Responding Climate Change, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Climate Change Adaptat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Maillet, Michelle] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Maillet, Michelle] McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Maillet, Michelle] McGill Univ, James Ford, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Maillet, Michelle] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Araos, Malcolm] NYU, Sociol, Sociol Climate Change, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Flynn, Melanie] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Belfer, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Energy & Resources, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Belfer, E (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Climate Change Adaptat Res Grp, Indigenous Communities Responding Climate Change, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456",Social Science and Humanities Research CouncilSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),"The authors thank the participants of this research for their thoughtful contributions, without which this project would not have been possible, and the anonymous reviewers of GEP for their insightful feedback on previous versions of this article.

Yet geographers are well positioned to take a leading role in the interdisciplinary turn in climate-related research. This paper explores the possibilities for physical and human geographers to collaborate within and beyond the discipline, specifically on the topic of climate modeling. We first examine geographical research critically examining the production and circulation of climate knowledge. Drawing on insights from a recent literature called Critical Physical Geography, we then outline how geographers might engage in collaborative and interdisciplinary work in order to promote more democratic practices of producing climate knowledge, enrich understandings of climate change, and more effectively serve goals of social and environmental justice. We argue that both the discipline of geography and the field of climate research stand to gain enormously from geographers' efforts to talk across the divide between social and natural science within and beyond the boundaries of geography.","[Colven, Emma] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Int & Area Studies, 729 Elm Ave,Farzaneh Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Thomson, Marcus J.] IIASA Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Grp, Vienna, Austria","Colven, E (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Int & Area Studies, 729 Elm Ave,Farzaneh Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",emmacolven@ou.edu,"Colven, Emma/N-2582-2019","Colven, Emma/0000-0002-4072-6303; Thomson, Marcus/0000-0002-5693-0245",,,,106,1,1,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1749-8198,,,GEOGR COMPASS,Geogr.

Theories of energy justice guided analysis of evidence presented at NEB hearings, the NEB's explanation of its decision, and a Supreme Court challenge. We find that several aspects of energy justice were weak in the NEB process. First, a project-specific scope obstructed the pursuit of equity within and between generations: the pipeline's contributions to climate change, impacts of the oil sands, and cumulative encroachment on Indigenous lands were excluded from review. Second, the NEB created a hierarchy of knowledge: it considered evidence of potential spill impacts as hypothetical while accepting as fact the proponent's claim that it could prevent and manage spills. Third, recognition of diversity remained elusive: Indigenous nations' dissatisfaction with the process challenged the NEB's interpretation of meaningful consultation and procedural fairness. To address the challenges of climate change and reconciliation between Indigenous and settler nations, it is crucial to identify which kinds of evidence decision-makers recognize as valid and which they exclude. Ideas from energy justice can help support actions to improve the public acceptability of energy decisions, as well as to foster greater Indigenous autonomy.","[Hunsberger, Carol; Awasis, Sakihitowin] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada","Hunsberger, C (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",chunsber@uwo.ca; cdakin2@uwo.ca,,"Hunsberger, Carol/0000-0002-2761-1333",Western Strategic Support grant [0000038955],This work was supported by a Western Strategic Support grant under the project ID 0000038955.,,80,10,10,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,783,10.3390/su11030783,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,WOS:000458929500228,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-08-07,

To assess the environmental justice implications of flooding from Hurricane Harvey in Greater Houston, Texas, we analyzed whether the areal extent of flooding was distributed inequitably with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, after controlling for relevant explanatory factors. Methods. Our study integrated cartographic information from Harvey's Inundation Footprint, developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, with sociodemographic data from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses were based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations. Results. The areal extent of Harvey-induced flooding was significantly greater in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black and socioeconomically deprived residents after we controlled for contextual factors and clustering. Conclusions. Results provide evidence of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic injustices in the distribution of flooding and represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of disproportionate impacts associated with Hurricane Harvey. Public Health Implications. Our findings highlight the need to prepare for and address the unequal social consequences of climate change-related disasters, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity.","[Chakraborty, Jayajit] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 500 West Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Chakraborty, Jayajit] Univ Texas El Paso, Socioenvironm & Geospatial Anal Lab, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Collins, Timothy W.] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Grineski, Sara E.] Univ Utah, Dept Sociol, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Chakraborty, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 500 West Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",jchakraborty@utep.edu,,,US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1760655],This research was funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF; grant CMMI-1760655).,,35,33,33,8,65,AMER PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOC INC,WASHINGTON,"800 I STREET, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20001-3710 USA",0090-0036,1541-0048,,AM J PUBLIC HEALTH,Am.

There is no one universally just and ecologically sustainable way of fulfilling these redistribution and consumption objectives; it depends on the criteria used and their underlying ethical teleology. We suggest three distribution criteria, borrowed from the foundations of the Environmental Justice (EJ) movement: need, entitlement and desert. By juxtaposing and problematising the needs, entitlements and deserts of nature and society, these criteria comprise an ethical framework for consumption Degrowth praxis in communities. We present arguments for how each distribution criterion fulfils the aims articulated in the Degrowth corpus. Based on these arguments, we propose seven justice-based community action principles for redistribution under Degrowth. In our discussion of these derived principles, we demonstrate that, like EJ, Degrowth seeks consequential as well as deontological justice, underscoring their deep complementarity. Therefore, our Need-Entitlement-Desert framework may serve as a useful guiding frame to include ethical distribution considerations in societies' pursuit of post-growth futures.","[Gabriel, Cle-Anne; Bond, Carol] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Gabriel, CA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",cleanne.gabriel@uq.edu.au; c.bond@business.uq.edu.au,"Gabriel, Cle-Anne/A-4468-2017; Bond, Carol J/D-9965-2014; Gabriel, Cle-Anne/H-8921-2019; Bond, Carol J/S-8820-2019","Gabriel, Cle-Anne/0000-0001-5862-4201; Bond, Carol J/0000-0003-2919-2790; Gabriel, Cle-Anne/0000-0001-5862-4201; Bond, Carol J/0000-0003-2919-2790",,,,59,6,6,3,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Statistical analyses were applied to reveal the national trends and local deviations from the trends. Results show that approximately 21.8 million (6.87% of) U.S. population are exposed to 100-year-flood in 2015, and most of the exposure is near water bodies (e.g. ocean and rivers). Additionally, communities near water bodies are more responsive to potential flood hazards by avoiding residence in flood zones than inland communities. At the national scale, economically disadvantaged population are more likely to reside in flood zones than outside. At the local scale, economically disadvantaged population tend to reside in flood zones in inland areas, while coastal flood zones are more occupied by wealthier and elderly people. These findings point to an alarming situation of inland communities where people are generally less responsive to flood hazards and people in flood zones are in a lower economic condition. Using hot spot analysis, local clusters of disadvantaged population groups with high flood exposure were identified. Overall, this study provides important baseline information for policymaking at different levels of administration and pinpoints local areas where diversified and ad hoc strategies are needed to mitigate flood risk in communities with diverse socio-economic conditions. This study provides empirical evidence of socio-economic disparities and environmental injustice associated with flood exposure in the U.S. and offers valuable insights to the underlying factors.","[Qiang, Yi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog & Environm, Saunders 416,2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Qiang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog & Environm, Saunders 416,2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",yiqiang@hawaii.edu,,,,,,49,20,20,0,32,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Resulting characterization of these knowledge themes, joined with cross-theme integration, demonstrate advances of agrobiodiversity research, management, and policy amid the accelerated global environmental and socioeconomic transformations of the Anthropocene. Framework results guide the presentation of new data from the Agrobiodiversity, Food, and Nutrition project (AFN) in Peru. These results integrate an emphasis on factors of global change, including climate change. The combination of the new knowledge framework and project results is utilized to point toward future directions for research, policy, and management. The Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework is essential to address the transformative planetary challenges of the Anthropocene that include sustainable development with nutritional security, biodiversity conservation, social justice, climate change, and nutrient pollution. Strengthening the focus on and analysis of the complex human-environment interactions of biodiversity in agriculture and food is vital as a nexus of science, scholarship, management, and policy in the era of Earth systems dominated by human activity.

Yet the influence of adaptation law and policy on the distribution of climate impacts is often overlooked in studies of socio-ecological resilience to climate change. This article demonstrates how environmental justice scholarship helps to address this gap in the literature relating to adaptation law and resilience. Drawing on existing literature, the article identifies four principles to promote resilience and justice through climate adaptation laws. Climate adaptation laws must (i) prepare for, and respond to, change; (ii) address the distributive effects of climate change and adaptation; (iii) promote participation in adaptation processes; and (iv) cross sectors and scales. Each criterion can be implemented in part through existing legal processes, but might also be further supported by incremental law reform. Developing both resilience and justice dimensions will enhance the effectiveness of adaptation laws in addressing climate impacts.","[Wenta, Joseph; McDonald, Jan; McGee, Jeffrey S.] Univ Tasmania, Fac Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wenta, Joseph; McDonald, Jan; McGee, Jeffrey S.] Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [McGee, Jeffrey S.] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Wenta, J (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Fac Law, Hobart, Tas, Australia.; Wenta, J (corresponding author), Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Joseph.Wenta@utas.edu.au; Jan.McDonald@utas.edu.au; Jeffrey.McGee@utas.edu.au,,"Wenta, Joseph/0000-0003-0946-6133","Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science","Faculty of Law, University of Tasmania; Centre for Marine Socioecology, Hobart, Tasmania (Australia).

It also requires facing the prospect that the loss and damage resulting from climate disasters will not be avoided through adaptation alone, that there will be extensive uncompensated losses, and that millions of climate displaced people may be on the move. The Paris Agreement is the international community's attempt to deal with these challenges. Yet, this article claims that the Agreement, which sets the parameters for the way forward, is a largely neoliberal document that undermines the corrective and distributive ideals of climate justice. Relying on the capabilities approach and a modified version of Amartya Sen's The Idea of Justice, this article teases out the 'clash of civilizations' between neoliberalism and climate justice. It sets out the concerns about neoliberalism in the climate change space and proceeds to interrogate the claim that the Paris Agreement is a neoliberal document. Essentially, climate justice demands state-based responses, developed through democratic deliberation and participation, to ensure the survival, functioning and flourishing of humans and non-humans. Neoliberalism, meanwhile, posits that government is too large and complex and that regulatory activities unnecessarily disrupt the efficient operation of the market economy. Furthermore, libertarian ideas of justice undermine climate justice principles as the valorization of market mechanisms, private property rights and private sector actors remove the issues from political contention and democratic participation. Ultimately, I question whether any justice-based normative meta-consensus or discursive meta-consensus, such as the Talanoa Dialogue, might be found in the Paris Agreement to disrupt the international neoliberal agenda.","[Lyster, Rosemary] Univ Sydney, Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lyster, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,,75,4,4,0,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

The English context entails several contradictions (antinomies) at ontological, epistemological and axiological levels, and is heavily influenced by an ideological struggle concerning the value of play within the sector as opposed to a climate of child performativity. Moreover, the predominately female workforce (a factor itself) has faced relentless changes in terms of qualifications and curriculum reforms in recent years. With the introduction of the graduate leader qualification (Early Years Teacher Status), a vast body of research has been seeking to conceptualise what leadership means for early childhood education and care. In this article, the authors argue that these attempts are helpful and contribute to this discourse of leadership, but it needs to be thought of not only abstractly, but also practically. Thus, the authors conclude, the (re)conceptualisation of leadership should locate it as pedagogical praxis after evaluating the inherent deep dispositions of leaders in conjunction with their history, surrounding culture and subjective perspectives/realities.","[Palaiologou, Ioanna; Male, Trevor] UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England","Palaiologou, I (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",i.palaiologou@ucl.ac.uk,"Male, Trevor/N-8991-2019","Male, Trevor/0000-0002-3703-3469; Palaiologou, Ioanna/0000-0003-0666-3959",,,,81,1,1,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1463-9491,,,CONTEMP ISS EARLY CH,Contemp.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992 (UNFCCC) established a foundation for the development, application and diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Against this background, it is useful to analyse how the Paris Agreement 2015 deals with the subject of intellectual property, technology transfer, and climate change. While there was discussion of a number of options for intellectual property and climate change, the final Paris Agreement 2015 contains no text on intellectual property. There is text, though, on technology transfer. The Paris Agreement 2015 relies upon technology networks and alliances in order to promote the diffusion and dissemination of green technologies. In order to achieve technology transfer, there has been an effort to rely on a number of formal technology networks, alliances, and public-private partnerships-including the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN); the World Intellectual Property Organization's WIPO GREEN; Mission Innovation; the Breakthrough Energy Coalition; and the International Solar Alliance. There have been grand hopes and ambitions in respect of these collaborative and co-operative ventures. However, there have also been significant challenges in terms of funding, support, and operation. In a case of innovation policy pluralism, there also seems to be a significant level of overlap and duplication between the diverse international initiatives. There have been concerns about whether such technology networks are effective, efficient, adaptable, and accountable. There is a need to better align intellectual property, innovation policy, and technology transfer in order to achieve access to clean energy and climate justice under the framework of the Paris Agreement 2015. At a conceptual level, philosophical discussions about climate justice should be grounded in pragmatic considerations about intellectual property and technology transfer. An intellectual property mechanism is necessary to provide for research, development, and deployment of clean technologies. There is a need to ensure that the technology mechanism of the Paris Agreement 2015 can enable the research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies at a scale to address the global challenges of climate change.","[Rimmer, Matthew] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Law, Intellectual Property & Innovat, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia","Rimmer, M (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Law, Intellectual Property & Innovat, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",matthew.rimmer@qut.edu.au,,"Rimmer, Matthew/0000-0002-2869-9971",,,,90,2,2,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-471X,,LAWS-BASEL,Laws,MAR,2019,8,1,,,,,,,7,10.3390/laws8010007,,,24,Law,Government & Law,VK1FX,WOS:000659962800006,,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

A three-phase process is introduced to enable these five Ws to be negotiated collectively and to engender critical reflection on the politics of urban resilience as plans, initiatives, and projects are conceived, discussed, and implemented.

This reflects evidence that the costs and benefits of low carbon restructuring will not be distributed evenly or fairly between people and places. Some households and localities will benefit from decarbonization but others will be disproportionately affected by rising energy costs and job loss. In this paper we use the example of England to explore different dimensions of advantage and disadvantage in low carbon restructuring and how they might be reinforced or mediated by intervention by governments, NGOs and citizens. The paper makes a distinctive contribution by linking different sites and policy areas in the distributional politics of decarbonization from the perspective of individuals and households. Emphasis is placed on understanding just energy-carbon transitions from a households-in-place perspective. The analytical framework is exemplified through case studies of the coming to ground of different strands of energy-carbon restructuring in England.","[While, Aidan] Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [While, Aidan] Univ Sheffield, Urban Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Eadson, Will] Sheffield Hallam Univ, CRESR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","While, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.; While, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Urban Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",a.h.while@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Eadson, Will/0000-0002-2158-7205",British Academy [SG111169],This work was supported by British Academy [grant number SG111169].,,72,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

Despite living in diverse contexts, Indigenous peoples face a number of common challenges. Disproportionate threats from climate change exist due to a range of factors including unique relationships with the natural environment, socioeconomic deprivation, a greater existing burden of disease, poorer access to and quality of health care, and political marginalization. Responses to climate change at global, national, and local levels also threaten Indigenous people's rights. While climate action presents many opportunities to improve health and reduce inequities, there is also significant potential for climate mitigation and adaptation policies to inflict harm on Indigenous peoples. An important aspect of this is the impact on traditional lands, which are acknowledged as a fundamental determinant of Indigenous health and well-being. This article seeks to elucidate the relationships between climate change and Indigenous health and to inform health promotion solutions to achieve climate justice for Indigenous peoples. The underpinning analysis is founded on a Kaupapa Maori positioning, which seeks transformative change and involves critiquing Western knowledges and structures that undermine Indigenous rights. A central theme is that anthropogenic climate change is intimately connected to the ideologies, systems and practices of colonialism, and that the impacts on Indigenous peoples can be conceptualized as an intensification of the process of colonization. It is not possible to understand and address climate-related health impacts for Indigenous peoples without examining this broader context of colonial oppression, marginalization and dispossession. The challenge for health promotion is to engage in a process of decolonization. This involves deconstructing its own systems and practices to avoid reinforcing colonialism and perpetuating inequities. It also requires health promotion practitioners to support Indigenous self-determination and recognize Indigenous knowledges as a critical foundation for climate change and health solutions.","[Jones, Rhys] Univ Auckland, Te Kupenga Hauora Maori, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1172, New Zealand","Jones, R (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Te Kupenga Hauora Maori, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1172, New Zealand.",rg.jones@auckland.ac.nz,,"Jones, Rhys/0000-0002-2424-3459",,,,84,11,11,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1757-9759,1757-9767,,GLOB HEALTH PROMOT,Glob.

Through a review of climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction literature, this article takes the position that the advancement of procedurally just adaptive planning should engage a dynamic framing of vulnerability that brings together aspects of both contextual and outcome vulnerability in order to support ongoing adaptation planning efforts that include the acknowledgement and representation of a full range of stakeholders. To illustrate this position, a case study of the City of Boston's resilience plans is presented to explore the strengths and weaknesses of current planning practices that vary in their static and dynamic conceptualization of vulnerability and participatory planning processes. This article opens the door for future research that evaluates the procedural justness of adaptation planning processes that are challenged to balance vulnerability assessment methodologies and engagement processes within the context of dynamic social, economic, environmental change.","[van den Berg, Hanne J.; Keenan, Jesse M.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","van den Berg, HJ (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hvandenberg@gsd.harvard.edu; jkeenan@gsd.harvard.edu,,,,,,58,8,8,2,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The Anthropocene Review 3(3): 188-200). Specifically, it responds to the call to explore 'the new human condition' (Palsson G, Szerszynski B, Sorlin S et al. (2013) Reconceptualizing the 'Anthropos' in the Anthropocene: Integrating the social sciences and humanities in global environmental change research. Environmental Science & Policy 28: 8) in the age of the Anthropocene by rethinking the relational ontology within the context of climate change. I propose that given the global and long-term implications of climate change, climate justice discourse should go beyond the Self-Other binary and incorporate the notion of the Unknown Other. By drawing on the moral philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas and moral sentimentalism scholarship, I theorize the ethical relationship with the Unknown Other. I propose that the encounter with the 'face' (identity, experience, voice) of the Unknown Other is conditioned by the Self's contribution to climate change. Therefore, the encounter with the Unknown Other is not physical and corporeal but ethical, and thus triggers a moral engagement that has a dual base - responsibility and emotion. The former is expressed in the form of asymmetrical responsibility and the latter in the form of empathy.","[Antadze, Nino] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Charlottetown, PE, Canada","Antadze, N (corresponding author), Univ Prince Edward Isl, Environm Studies Program, 550 Univ Ave, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.",nantadze@upei.ca,,"Antadze, Nino/0000-0002-6790-5547",,,,96,2,2,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

However, to date there has been no in-depth determination of the impact of Stranded Assets for rural water supply, despite international development targets from Rio, through Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The limiting factor for carrying out such an assessment is the requirement of a full and detailed asset register recording all rural water supplies in a country. The Scottish Government Climate Justice Fund Water Futures Programme, in collaboration with the Government of Malawi, is undertaking a comprehensive asset audit across Malawi, and this paper introduces the concept of Stranded Assets for the rural water supply sector using Malawi as an exemplar.

This study explores the effectiveness of TMNs in reaching adaptation outcomes and how financial, material, and knowledge exchanges of TMNs tend to exclude adaptation in high-priority intermediary cities. Nearly 40 semi-structured interviews with Indonesian city actors and a preliminary catalogue of cities participating in TMNs reveal that risk-averse selection criteria, insufficient impact assessments, and duplicative institutional efforts reinforce disparities between primary and intermediary cities. To effectively build adaptive capacity in the most vulnerable regions, TMNs should remove participation barriers for intermediary cities, improve incentives for institutional collaboration, and adopt more rigorous evaluative metrics.

Through the lens of migrants in the Indian cities of Bengaluru and Surat, we highlight how experiences of environmental marginality can be attributed to a lack of recognition of citizenship rights and informal livelihood strategies. Specifically, the drivers of non-recognition in this situation relate to broken social networks and a lack of political voice, as well as heightened exposure to emerging climate risks and economic precariousness. We find that migrants experience extreme forms of climate injustice as they are often invisible to the official state apparatus, or worse, are actively erased from cities through force or discriminatory development policies. Current theories must therefore engage more seriously with issues of recognition to enable more radical climate justice in cities.","[Chu, Eric] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Michael, Kavya] Energy & Resources Inst, New Delhi, India","Chu, E (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",e.chu@bham.ac.uk; kavya.michael@teri.res.in,"Michael, Kavya/AAC-4846-2020; Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for International Studies; Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations; Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR) under the Collaborative Adaptation Research in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) programme of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Government of Canada; UK Department for International Development (DFID).","The Surat case study was supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for International Studies and the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.

The Arannas' are predominantly older women who undertake non-violent direct action using fibre craft, knit-ins, lock-ons, and occasional street theatre to draw public attention to the negative environmental impacts of unconventional coal seam gas extraction ('fracking') and of fossil fuel mining. We identify the characteristics of Nannagogy as a hybrid system of lifelong / later-in-life learning and a complex pedagogy of informal learning that can be understood through social movement learning theory (SML) drawing on Paolo Freire's (1970) original concept of `conscientisation'. Nannagogy is an act of radical adult education that has its antecedents in feminist collective learning strategies such as consciousness raising as well as the formal education strategies of action learning and communities of practice. Nannagogy is highly effective adult learning practice at the intersection of adult learning theory and social movement theory. Data presented in this paper were collected with active KNAG members in Australia as part of a PhD study using surveys, interviews, document analysis of social media (Facebook posts, digital videos, e-news bulletins) and researcher autoethnography. Framing activist adult learning as social movement learning locates environmental and climate justice struggles within lifelong learning practices and enables researchers to better understand the complex processes of informal, situated and often spontaneous adult learning for creating and sustaining movements for social, environmental and political change.","[Larri, Larraine; Whitehouse, Hilary] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Larri, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Div Trop Environm & Soc, Coll Arts Soc & Educ, 1 James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",larraine.larri@my.jcu.edu.au,"Larri, Larraine/AAA-5091-2019","Larri, Larraine/0000-0002-1593-2463",,,,32,4,4,0,2,ADULT LEARNING AUSTRALIA INC,CANBERRA CITY,"GPO BOX 260, CANBERRA CITY, ACT 2601, AUSTRALIA",1443-1394,,,AUST J ADULT LEARN,Aust.

Such a shift expands the understanding of health from a phenomenon focused solely on humanity toward one of interdependent animal, environment, and overall planetary well-being, recalibrating the future roles and responsibilities of nursing accordingly. While there is limited data that discusses nursing-focused contributions to planetary health, the advancement of planetary nursing has been the focus of scholarly dialogue. Knowledge regarding the planet's systems, species, ecosystems, and myriad environmental dimensions must be integrated throughout nursing education to be translated to practice and social justice initiatives. As the profession deepens collaborations with international policymakers, nurses will become integral to advancing planetary health through social justice and health equity efforts. Nursing research must evolve to contribute to the goal of planetary health for the next generation and beyond. Ultimately, these authors call for a shift toward One MindOne HealthOne Planet to move the disciplinary stance from one of global nursing to a more expansive view of planetary nursing in alignment with initiatives to promote and sustain planetary health.","[Rosa, William E.] Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Upvall, Michele J.] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Nursing, Dept Nursing Syst, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Rosa, WE (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",wrosa@nursing.upenn.edu,,"Rosa, William/0000-0002-0680-8911",,,,36,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0029-6473,1744-6198,,NURS FORUM,Nurs.

The results indicate that religiosity decreased action on climate change, whereas personal norms, science and technology (S&T) optimism, and environmentalism increased such action. Among the perception factors, perceived risks and benefits, trust, and knowledge increased action on climate change. Furthermore, perception factors explained action on climate change more than value factors did.

The complex interplay between social policy and the built/ physical environment contributes to these outcomes, but much of the research on environmental justice focuses on either producing evidence of inequity or assessing policy to determine its effect on the physical environment. This paper attempts to unite those two approaches by 1) measuring the urban tree canopy (UTC) at a scale that reflects local socio-political decision making and 2) assessing how the local policy documents regulating UTC acknowledge and attempt to remediate disparity. A maximum likelihood supervised classification of 1-m resolution imagery for a purposive sample of twelve historically racially segregated neighborhoods in two North Carolina cities estimated UTC at the block level. Using a spatial autoregressive model, we found a statistically significant negative association between UTC coverage, percentage of non-White population, the presence of nonresidential zoning, and percentage of parcel within the right-of-way. Content analysis found the municipal comprehensive plans and development management ordinances lack city-wide canopy coverage goals, do not utilize neighborhood geographies to target action and evaluation, and do not account for, or attempt to reduce, the potential inequitable distribution of urban trees. Existing policies could further contribute to disparate UTC outcomes by allowing neighborhoods to create their own UTC coverage standards and by crafting ordinances with variable standards for neighborhoods with non-residential zones. As a result, communities unable to counteract intensive zoning and/or advocate for enhanced tree canopy provisions are at a disadvantage in the remediation of UTC disparities. These findings highlight the need for analytical approaches that integrate the identification of disparities with the evaluation of present-day policy frameworks that may perpetuate and/or exacerbate inequitable outcomes.","[Kolosna, Carl; Spurlock, Danielle] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Spurlock, D (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept City & Reg Planning, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",spurlock@unc.edu,,,,,,60,3,5,2,27,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

Frames and news values (or 'journalistic selection procedures') make it more intelligible, foregrounding salient elements. Giving shape to reality, both concepts cannot be separated from ideological interests, either. Previous research suggests, accordingly, that frames and newsworthiness take shape in mutual interaction. Yet, the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear as in-depth discursive research is lacking. Therefore, we have conducted a combined framing-news value analysis, drawing on a corpus of climate articles published in three mainstream and two alternative media outlets in Northern Belgium. This article discusses the relations among four selected news values and the ideologically coloured subframes of the Cycles of Nature and Environmental Justice frames. The presented schemata and exemplary analyses demonstrate the strong overlap between the salience-enhancing devices of subframes and news values. Also, they make tangible the ideological argumentations at the intersection of newsworthiness and framing, explicating the diverging realizations of news values in the context of various subframes. As such, this study lays bare some of the journalistic conventions which are often used in climate reporting to naturalize certain worldviews.

However, addressing the increasingly evident threats of climate change in the neoliberal, post-financial-crisis city raises several questions about its equitable implementation. This paper suggests that the prioritisation of a specific mode of climate resilient urban development represents a departure from the previous decades' movement toward sustainable urbanism. We refer to this new development paradigm as climate urbanism', a policy orientation that (1) promotes cities as the most viable and appropriate sites of climate action and (2) prioritises efforts to protect the physical and digital infrastructures of urban economies from the hazards associated with climate change. We argue that the potential social justice impacts of climate urbanism have not been fully interrogated. Certainly, cities are appropriate sites for addressing climate change, but in the current neoliberal context, the transition from policy rhetoric to climate action presents a potentially problematic landscape of inequality and injustice. With that in mind, this paper offers a critical lens to evaluate the merits of climate urbanism and to interrogate its potential outcomes.","[Long, Joshua] Southwestern Univ, Georgetown, TX USA; [Rice, Jennifer L.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Long, J (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ, Environm Studies, 1001 E Univ Ave,Box 7376, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA.",jlong@southwestern.edu,,,,,,76,30,30,8,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,APR,2019,56,5,,,,,992,1008,,10.1177/0042098018770846,,,17,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,HQ8KE,WOS:000462672800009,,,,,2021-08-07,

Climate change will exacerbate the existing threats to vulnerable communities, such as the poor, and threaten the food security of populations in coastal areas through the effects of flooding due to coastal inundation. Indonesia is an Archipelagic State of over 17,000 islands and is vulnerable to climate change impacts in its coastal areas and especially in its highly populated low lying delta areas, such as Jakarta and Semarang, where vulnerability to sea level rise is evident. The adequacy of the legal adaptation framework in Indonesia to respond to this climate vulnerability is assessed and it is found to have limited consideration of the community burden arising from these climate and SLR uncertainties. A more inclusive social justice approach could assist government to respond to the impacts from these issues and to their implications for vulnerable groups. The nation can improve adaptive legal measures to address climate change impacts and increase the involvement of local people in climate change adaptation decision making. Funding is required to assist policy makers to further incorporate adaptation into decision making, and this could improve social justice outcomes for vulnerable Indonesian coastal communities.","[Nurhidayah, Laely] Indonesian Inst Sci PMB LIPI, Res Ctr Soc & Culture, Gd Widya Graha Lt 6 Jl Gatot Subroto 10, Jakarta, Indonesia; [McIlgorm, Alistair] Univ Wollongong, ANCORS, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Nurhidayah, L (corresponding author), Indonesian Inst Sci PMB LIPI, Res Ctr Soc & Culture, Gd Widya Graha Lt 6 Jl Gatot Subroto 10, Jakarta, Indonesia.",lae1003@lipi.go.id,,"Mcilgorm, Alistair/0000-0001-6625-5573; Nurhidayah, Laely/0000-0002-9903-0239",Australian Government's Endeavour Research Fellowship 2017,"This research was supported by Australian Government's Endeavour Research Fellowship 2017 with host institution at Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS), The University of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.",,47,4,4,3,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,APR 1,2019,171,,,,,,11,18,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.01.011,,,8,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,HP1CU,WOS:000461403800002,,,,,2021-08-07,

PGIS has since matured into a distinct subfield in which GIS is used to enhance the political engagement of historically marginalized people and to shape political outcomes through mapping. However, this has proven to be difficult work. We suggest that this is because PGIS, particularly in its community development incarnations, though well-intentioned in endeavoring to enhance the voices of the excluded, is inherently limited because it primarily aims to enhance the inclusion and participation of the historically marginalized by working within established frameworks of institutionalized governance in particular places. This, we suggest, has left this mode of PGIS ill-equipped to truly challenge the political-economic structures responsible for (re)producing the very conditions of socio-economic inequality it strives to ameliorate. As a result, we argue that PGIS has become de-politicized, operating within, rather than disrupting, existing spheres of political-economic power. Moving forward, we suggest that PGIS is in need of being retheorized by engaging with the emergent post-politics literature and related areas of critical social and political theory. We argue that by adopting a more radical conception of democracy, justice, and 'the political', PGIS praxis can be recentered around disruption rather than participation and, ultimately, brought closer to its self-proclaimed goal of supporting progressive change for the historically marginalized.","[Radil, Steven M.] Univ Idaho, Geog, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Anderson, Matthew B.] Eastern Washington Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Isle Hall 110, Cheney, WA 99004 USA","Anderson, MB (corresponding author), Eastern Washington Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Isle Hall 110, Cheney, WA 99004 USA.",manderson22@ewu.edu,,"Radil, Steven/0000-0002-0985-8930",,,,107,14,14,1,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1325,1477-0288,,PROG HUM GEOG,Prog.

From the Americas to the Mediterranean, borders cut through the increasingly integrated world in a way that exposes the inside-outside logic of contemporary capitalism. All this happens on a backdrop where cities are becoming the key sites of contestation since borders and levees do not suffice to keep them intact. Cities are also increasingly becoming the focus of international efforts to deal with climate change and migration, where nation-states are falling short. By synthesizing the possibilities of urban belonging and right-to-the-world, we argue that new urban imaginaries are at the frontline of the mobilities debate today. Consequently, we argue for a cross-pollination of mobility justice and climate justice as urban citizenship. The main thrust of our argument is that there are viable alternatives to the isolationist fortress nation model, which can bring a new dimension to debates concerning climate change and migration. Fearless cities are but one example of these emerging alternatives. By focusing on the opportunities for a radical response to climate change and migration, we suggest that cities can respond to the burning mobility challenges of our times with a just, grounded and egalitarian urban citizenship framed as mobile commons.","[Turhan, Ethemcan; Armiero, Marco] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Environm Humanities Lab, Stockholm, Sweden","Turhan, E (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Environm Humanities Lab, Stockholm, Sweden.",ethemcan@kth.se,"Armiero, Marco/AAX-2981-2020","Armiero, Marco/0000-0002-6063-9477",Svenska Forskningsradet FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2017-01962_3],This work was supported by the Svenska Forskningsradet Formas [2017-01962_3].,,83,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,MAY 4,2019,14,3,,,SI,,363,374,,10.1080/17450101.2019.1600913,,APR 2019,12,Geography; Transportation,Geography; Transportation,IS9QC,WOS:000466298700001,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

A large body of work has critiqued the naturalisation of scarcity in discourses of environmental change, and has highlighted problems in how scarcity is conceptualised and the ways in which scarcities are socially and politically generated. Despite this, the 'scarcity postulate' - an assumed mismatch between infinitely expanding human desires and finite means to realise them remains a powerful concept that continues to be deployed and re-deployed in a host of debates concerning environment and natural resources. From the 'Limits to Growth' debates that influenced environmental movements in the 1970s, discussions concerning the causes and consequences of the overlapping food, fuel and finance crises of the 2000s to debates concerning climate change, environmental security and militarisation in the Anthropocene, the discursive constellation of scarcity seems always at work. The focus of this special issue is the cross-scalar dynamics of what we identify as a 'new politics of scarcity'. This new politics is associated with new framings, contestations and entanglements of scarcity that are associated with new configurations of actors, new political economic relations and new spatialities and geographies of resource control and violence. Building on the empirical cases developed in this special issue, we examine the dynamics and the 'work' of the new cross-scalar scarcity politics in sustaining elite and capitalist power through justifying resource acquisitions and enclosures, large-scale policy reforms in the name of 'austerity' and intensification of extraction whilst politically side-stepping more thorny politics of (re)distribution, mis-appropriation, dispossession and social justice. We conclude by looking at alternative framings and vernacular conceptions of sustainability that challenge dominant scarcity-driven policies and programmes that intensify local exclusions and inequalities.","[Mehta, Lyla; Huff, Amber; Allouche, Jeremy] Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Mehta, Lyla] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway","Mehta, L (corresponding author), Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",l.mehta@ids.ac.uk; a.huff@ids.ac.uk; j.allouche@ids.ac.uk,,"Allouche, Jeremy/0000-0002-9639-3675; Huff, Amber/0000-0002-2614-2045",,,,131,12,12,2,18,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,MAY,2019,101,,,,,,222,230,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.10.027,,,9,Geography,Geography,IE9GW,WOS:000472683900026,,Green Submitted,,,2021-08-07,

However, coal remains entangled with contentious development agendas in many parts of the world, while fossil fuel industries continue to flourish. This article discusses these entanglements through a climate justice lens that engages the cultural politics surrounding coal and energy transition. We highlight how recent struggles around phasing out coal have stimulated renewed critical debates around colonialism, empire, and capitalism more broadly, recognizing climate change as an intersectional issue encompassing racial, gender, and economic justice. With social movements locked in struggles to resist the development or expansion of coal mines, power plants, and associated infrastructure, we unpack tensions that emerge as transnational alliances connect disparate communities across the world. Our conclusion signals the need for greater critical engagement with how intersecting inequalities are coded into the cultural politics of coal, and how this shapes efforts to pursue a just transition.","[Brown, Benjamin] Univ East Anglia, Int Dev Anthropol & Polit, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Spiegel, Samuel J.] Univ Edinburgh, Int Dev, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Brown, B (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Int Dev Anthropol & Polit, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",,,"Spiegel, Samuel/0000-0003-2163-3512",,,,83,17,17,4,37,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1526-3800,1536-0091,,GLOBAL ENVIRON POLIT,Glob.

It makes a fresh contribution by bringing in aspects of green grabbing that are less visible and obvious. These are subtle, fluid and indirect interconnections between climate change politics and land grabs. It is difficult to see these interconnections from an 'either black or white' perspective. It is likely that the extent of this 'grey area' intersection in terms of affected social relations, nature and land use change is quite significant globally, even when such interconnections tend to operate below the radar of dominant governance institutions and database tracking. This situation calls for more nuanced understanding of governance imperatives, and for constructing the necessary body of knowledge needed for appropriate political intervention. This paper offers preliminary ways in which such interconnections can be seen and understood, and their implications for research and politics explored. It concludes by way of a preliminary discussion of the notion of 'agrarian climate justice' as a possible framework for formal governance or political activism relevant to tackling such grey area interconnections.","[Franco, Jennifer C.; Borras, Saturnino M., Jr.] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies COHD, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Franco, Jennifer C.] Transnatl Inst TNI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Borras, Saturnino M., Jr.] Int Inst Social Studies ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands","Borras, SM (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies COHD, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Borras, SM (corresponding author), Int Inst Social Studies ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.",borras@iss.nl,,,Dutch NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); UK DFID; Myanmar Programme of the Transnational Institute (TNI); BRICS Initiatives for Critical Agrarian Studies (BICAS); Ford Foundation Beijing Office; IDRC project; FIAN; TNI in Uganda; TNI in South Africa; TNI in Mali; TNI in Nigeria,"The research for this paper benefited from the support of the research project Mosaic: Climate change mitigation policies, land grabbing and conflict in Cambodia and Myanmar (2014-2018) funded by the Dutch NWO and the UK DFID, the Myanmar Programme of the Transnational Institute (TNI), the BRICS Initiatives for Critical Agrarian Studies (BICAS) with funds from the Ford Foundation Beijing Office, and the IDRC project with FIAN and TNI in Uganda, South Africa, Mali and Nigeria in 2015-2017 (and its continuation in 2018-2020 in Mali and Nigeria).

This article examines the extent to which individuals demonstrate awareness of the three nexus elements: water-energy, energy-food, and food-water. MethodsWe use three awareness indexes as dependent variables and varying sociodemographic characteristics and aspects of environmental concern as predictors in the statistical analysis. ResultsOur results suggest that there are some patterned or systematic correlates with the nexus elements, although relationships do not always turn out as anticipated. Indeed, explanations of nexus awareness do not follow previously studies' explanations of environmental concern, and vary depending on which elements of the nexus are analyzed. ConclusionWe conclude with suggestions to raise awareness of the connections between natural resources among all populations.

This included forms of public endorsement, policy documents and legislative change that prioritised further oil development in the country to create a certain common-sense around increased fossil fuel extraction. In response, a range of communities and autonomous Oil Free groups have emerged to contest both the legislative changes and this underlying common-sense. We draw on this example to respond to calls within geography and political science literature to situate analysis of contemporary politics in empirical contexts. We use Ranciere's thought combined with the frames of politicisation, depoliticisation and repoliticisation to explore the entangled nature of government and oil industry actions, and community climate change activism. We argue that while there were clearly attempts by government and the oil industry to close down spaces of dissent and limit debate around fossil fuel development to technocratic questions of health and safety, the effects of attempts at closure are paradoxical. Such attempts at closure are always incomplete and at times, mobilise people to contestatory action. We show how activists have strategically drawn on certain discourses to exert claims of, and for, equality in public debates around the pressing issue of climate change.","[Bond, Sophie] Univ Otago, Human Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Diprose, Gradon] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Auckland, New Zealand; [Thomas, Amanda C.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Environm Studies & Geog, Wellington, New Zealand","Bond, S (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand.",sophie.bond@otago.ac.nz,,"Diprose, Gradon/0000-0001-5394-9410","University of Otago (Otago Research Grant); Te Ihowhenua/Department of Geography, University of Otago; School of Social Sciences of Open Polytechnic, Aotearoa New Zealand","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by internal grants from the University of Otago (Otago Research Grant) and some additional support from Te Ihowhenua/Department of Geography, University of Otago and the School of Social Sciences of Open Polytechnic, Aotearoa New Zealand.",,56,9,9,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-6544,2399-6552,,ENVIRON PLAN C-POLIT,Env.

Yet discussions of the anthropocene can also be better contextualized in terms of their featuring certain phenomena as 'new' that are really much more longstanding phenomena. For example, many Indigenous peoples have ancient traditions of environmental 'mobility.' This essay reviews some of the history of Indigenous philosophies, especially Anishinaabe, of mobility, migration, and resettlement. Often these philosophies focus on fluid and transformative relationships as constituting the fabric of resilient societies. Indigenous traditions of mobility are critically relevant for climate justice. They put into relief how colonial power can operate as a containment strategy that works to curtail mobility. In this way, looking at Indigenous mobility in the anthropocene involves unraveling layers of colonialism where containment has been widely imposed. This claim can be used to signal some of the dangers of centering the causal role of climate change in certain cases societal movement. To further support our claims, the essay concludes with a brief analysis of some of the literature and testimonies on resettlement in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.","[Whyte, Kyle; Talley, Jared L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Gibson, Julia D.] Queens Univ, Dept Philosophy, John Watson Hall, Kingston, ON, Canada","Whyte, K (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kwhyte@msu.edu,,"Gibson, Julia/0000-0002-8907-4916",,,,78,4,4,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,MAY 4,2019,14,3,,,SI,,319,335,,10.1080/17450101.2019.1611015,,,17,Geography; Transportation,Geography; Transportation,IS9QC,WOS:000482482000003,,,,,2021-08-07,

The ability to exercise mobility or not (of oneself or others) is an exertion of power that demarcates where particular people belong and under what kind of environmental conditions. This essay focuses on the significance of borders in creating environmental privilege in the Anthropocene. Environmental privilege is accrued through the exercise of economic, political, and cultural power that enables the construction of exclusive environmental amenities such as clean air and water, open space, and safe neighborhoods. For years, environmental justice scholars have revealed the burdens and oppressive conditions associated with environmental inequality, but few studies consider the flipside of that reality. We argue that environmental privileges enjoyed by some rest upon the manipulation of the mobility of others - human and nonhuman. We believe border making will come under greater pressure as the effects of climate change increase, and the volume of resources required to maintain exclusive spaces intensifies. Continued mass migration will bring heightened anxieties about national identity and calls for greater border enforcement, despite the reality that borders - both literal and figurative - consistently fail to alleviate migratory pressures while exacerbating the effects of climate change and environmental injustice. Our research shows that greater ecological instability increases efforts to create privatized places as pristine spaces untouched by global turmoil, thereby reinforcing those social forces that produce environmental injustices in the first place.","[Park, Lisa Sun-Hee] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Asian Amer Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Park, LSH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Asian Amer Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lspark@asamst.ucsb.edu,,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,MAY 4,2019,14,3,,,SI,,395,400,,10.1080/17450101.2019.1601397,,,6,Geography; Transportation,Geography; Transportation,IS9QC,WOS:000482482000010,,,,,2021-08-07,

To do so, I apply critical qualitative analysis to narratives from American youth who participated in a global climate change education program in Bangladesh. My findings include the importance of contextualizing climate justice, framing climate change around humans, implicating ourselves in the problem and recognizing our own obligations in mitigation, seeing climate change as real and tangible, being in a place impacted by climate change, feeling solidarity with those impacted, and recognizing social injustice and power disparities within climate change impacts.

Variables that exhibit relationships with GSI density are varied over space, as well as between cities. In Baltimore, GSI density is significantly associated with presence of green space (+), impervious surface coverage (+), and population density (-) at the CBG scale; though these relationships vary over space. At the census tract scale in Baltimore, a different combination of indicators explains GSI density, including elevation (+), population characteristics, and building characteristics. Spatial regression analysis in Portland indicates that GSI density at the CBG scale is associated with residents identifying as White (-) and well-draining hydrologic soil groups A and B (-). At both census tract and CBG scales, GSI density is associated with median income (-) and sewer pipe density (-). Hierarchical modelling of GSI density presents significant spatial dependence as well as group dependence implicit to Portland at the census tract scale. Significant results of this model retain income and sewer pipe density as explanatory variables, while introducing the relationship between GSI density and impervious surface coverage. Overall, this research offers decision-relevant information for urban resilience in multiple environments and could serve as a reminder for cities to consider who is inherently exposed to GSI benefits.

One of the debates in climate ethics concerns how the available emissions should be divided between people. One popular answer, sometimes called Emissions Egalitarianism (EE), proposes a distribution of emissions permits that gives everyone an equal per capita share of the atmospheric absorptive capacity. However, several debaters have objected to EE. First, it has been argued that there is no principled reason to accept EE, since it cannot be justified on the basis of any moral theory. Second, it has been argued that there is neither any pragmatic reason to accept EE, since it is impracticable, politically unfeasible, and fails to reach its goal. This paper defends EE against these objections. First, it shows that EE can be justified on libertarian, utilitarian, and fairness grounds, respectively. Second, it shows that EE is neither more impracticable, nor more politically unfeasible, than its rivals. It also argues that EE does not fail to reach its goal.

These recent works highlight various normative approaches for engaging with what is often referred to as the Anthropocene. Drawing on virtue ethics, pragmatism, and concepts such as intergenerational justice, they seek to address some of the defining moral challenges of our time: how we shouldrespond to this unprecedented era of anthropogenic climate and environmental change, and what ethical resources we candraw on to guide our response. On a larger level, they reveal how the climate crisis is testing the limits of our current moral systems and helping to drive greater ethical innovation and adaptation in the process.","[Lowe, Benjamin S.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, POB 116455, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Lowe, BS (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, POB 116455, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",benlowe@ufl.edu,"Lowe, Benjamin/X-7936-2019","Lowe, Benjamin/0000-0002-1879-254X",,,,7,1,1,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1187-7863,1573-322X,,J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC,J.

This paper analyses whether climate-smart agriculture policy meets the demands of climate justice and respects the rights of smallholders; and if not, how it could be amended. The study is based on a literature review supplemented by four interviews with climate-smart agriculture actors from diverse backgrounds: a consultant, a smallholder farmer, a practitioner, and a scientist. To examine the climate-smart agriculture concept and its implementation, the following ethical positions are considered: maximalist, minimalist, Pogge's intermediate position, Nussbaum's capability approach, Kantian, and Altruist. The study finds that current climate-smart agriculture approaches are not being fairly implemented because there is the unjust sharing of benefits of income and burdens of emission reduction costs, among smallholders and agro-industries. According to the principles of climate justice, this sharing proportion should be equally distributed based on an individual's capacities and poverty should be taken into consideration as well. Climate-smart agriculture should be fair for the farmers; it should not only push and promote agribusiness expansion. The power of multinational corporations has substantially altered global agrifood chains to the detriment of small farmers and the environment. The mandatory inclusion of local, regional and national level civil society organisations and networks holds the potential for a more fair implementation of climate-smart agriculture. Climate-smart agriculture policy could be more successfully implemented if state and non-state/private sector actors would support such collaboration, allowing for decision making at local levels and a deep and honest reflection on development narratives.","[Budiman, Ibnu] Wageningen Univ, Global Change & Global Eth, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Budiman, I (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Global Change & Global Eth, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",Budimanibnu26@gmail.com,,"Budiman, Ibnu/0000-0002-9128-0866",LPDP (Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education),"I would like to thank Anna Seidel, Henk van den Belt, the interviewees, and LPDP (Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education) for your support to this paper.",,57,3,3,1,12,KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH,KASSEL,"DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY",2197-411X,,,FUTURE FOOD,Future Food,JUN,2019,7,1,,,,,31,41,,10.17170/kobra-2018122074,,,11,Food Science & Technology,Food Science & Technology,IB2WA,WOS:000470128200004,,,,,2021-08-07,

Results: A steering committee of nurse climate change scholars and interested faculty developed a mission, vision, core values, and a strategic plan for the CCCCJH and are working on integrating climate change topics into nursing curricula at all levels. Conclusion: Nurses are in the ideal position to lead the way to increase awareness among health professionals and students about the health impacts of climate change. Curricular integration of climate change topics at all levels will prepare our students to meet the needs and challenges of the future.","[Neal-Boylan, Leslie] Amer Assoc Coll Nursing, Acad Affairs & Program Innovat, 36 1st Ave, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Neal-Boylan, Leslie] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Nursing, Inst Hlth Profess, Sch Nursing, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Breakey, Suellen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Nursing, Inst Hlth Profess, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Breakey, Suellen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Prelicensure Generalist Programs, Sch Nursing, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Breakey, Suellen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Climate Change Climate Justice & Hlth, Sch Nursing, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Neal-Boylan, L (corresponding author), Amer Assoc Coll Nursing, Acad Affairs & Program Innovat, 36 1st Ave, Boston, MA 02129 USA.",lneal-boylan@mghihp.edu,,,,,,16,4,4,1,8,SLACK INC,THOROFARE,"6900 GROVE RD, THOROFARE, NJ 08086 USA",0148-4834,1938-2421,,J NURS EDUC,J.

While WtE is subject to different EU policies and must comply with different sets of EU regulatory frameworks, the policies are largely intertwined and share common objectives enabling the achievement of a sustainable European future via the circular economy. With support from the theoretical foundation for the potential to unite climate, energy, and environmental justice, the paper calls for a streamlined policy in the context of WtE. The paper also highlights the value of this linkage from a practical perspective illustrating how these different policies could be bridged through the new technology - the patented micro-scale Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU), which has been invented to process all unwanted domestic materials and generate energy for the household.","[Malinauskaite, J.] Brunel Univ London, London, England; [Jouhara, H.] Brunel Univ London, Inst Energy Futures, Coll Engn Design & Phys Sci, London, England","Malinauskaite, J (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, London, England.",jurgita.malinauskaite@brunel.ac.uk; hussam.jouhara@brunel.ac.uk,"Jouhara, Hussam/B-8079-2009","Jouhara, Hussam/0000-0002-6910-6116",,,,63,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2019,129,,,,,,636,645,,10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.029,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HY3GZ,WOS:000468012900058,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

Only when the safety, social status, and livelihoods of all members of society are assured will voluntary, democratic decisions be possible to reverse climate change and fairly mitigate its effects. Socio-environmental and climate justice, commoning, and decolonization are pre-conditions for participatory, responsible governance that both signals and assists the development of equitable socio-political systems. Degrowth movements, when they explicitly prioritize equity, can help to focus activism for climate justice and sustainable livelihoods. This paper overviews the theoretical grounding for these arguments, drawing from the work of ecofeminist and Indigenous writers. Indigenous (and also ecofeminist) praxis is grounded in activists' leadership for commoning and resistance to extraction, the fossil fuel economy, and commodified property rights. These movements are building a politics of decolonization, respect, solidarity, and hope rather than xenophobia and despair.","[Perkins, Patricia E.

Initiatives currently envisaged in NDCs are insufficient to avoid disastrous climate change. Debates about the impact of climate action on economic development and national interests have abated the climate ambition of some governments. Conflicting modeling approaches have contributed to these debates. To scale up global climate efforts, it will be essential to convince Parties that the short-term benefits of robust national climate action outweigh its immediate costs. Innovation is driving progress to address climate change and can deliver substantial development co-benefits, particularly by reducing costs of renewable energy technologies and enabling new business models. However, innovation can take many years to reach deployment stage, can create unforeseen problems of its own, and does not benefit all equally. Climate justice links human rights, development and climate regimes. A climate justice perspective provides a normative, analytical and procedural framework to identify barriers to innovation diffusion, optimize development co-benefits of climate action and help build public support for the adoption of more ambitious NDC pledges.","[Glemarec, Yannick] UN Women, Policy & Programme United Nations Entity Gender E, New York, NY 10017 USA","Glemarec, Y (corresponding author), UN Women, Policy & Programme United Nations Entity Gender E, New York, NY 10017 USA.",yannickglemarec@orange.fr,,,,,,86,3,3,3,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1674-0750,2198-2600,,FUDAN J HUM SOC SCI,Fudan J.

In contrast with the findings of a large number of previous studies of environmentalists/environmental educators, outdoor experiences during childhood were not generally a major formative influence on the respondents. Although Western children nowadays commonly have fewer opportunities to enjoy such experiences, analysis showed that the differences were not due simply to changes over time. Uniquely in research on SLEs of environmentalists/environmental educators, we also examined respondents' values and motivations, to further understand what inspires action. Social justice concerns were rated as more motivating than biospheric concerns by the sample as a whole, and altruistic and biospheric values were considered equally important as guiding principles. These findings have implications for the framing of climate change as an 'environmental' problem, and suggest that, contrary to conclusions that may have been drawn from past research, environmental education specifically directed towards stimulating engagement with climate change need not entail promoting outdoor experiences, nature connectedness, or biospheric values and motivations for action.","[Howell, Rachel A.] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Howell, Rachel A.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Allen, Simon] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Howell, RA (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.; Howell, RA (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",rachel.howell@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,61,14,14,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

This exploratory study uses thematic analysis of interview and focus group data to investigate the understandings of educators, student teachers and environmental specialists on the issues of climate change, climate justice, and climate change education. The findings of this study present two contrasting perspectives on climate change and climate change education. The first perspective is predominant amongst teachers and students teachers. Its focus is on climate change as a geographical process with individual private actions as the possible solution. The second perspective, predominant amongst environmental specialists, characterises climate change as a global injustice requiring political, social and economic mobilisation. This study suggests that a critical, open-ended, holistic approach to climate change education is required, which provides multiple spaces for reflection and engages children with models of citizenship which embrace political action.

Its intention is to help generate a different framing of socionatural change that goes beyond the current science-policy-behavioural change pathway. It puts forward several moments of inadvertent concealment in contemporary debates that stem directly from the way issues are framed and imagined in contemporary discourses.

To facilitate a critical orientation towards the informal economies of social reproduction, the ways that the UK's climate politics are rooted in masculinist discourses of a green economy are illustrated. Adopting an intersectional approach, it is argued that such a green economy perspective diverts attention from labouring bodies in climate politics, invisibilising the 'who' in the experience of climate solutions. Through critically engaging divisions of labour in climate policy, evidenced through a feminist critical discourse analysis, it is shown how a surface-level inclusion of gender perpetuates the labouring bodies associated with specific labour markets. In response, it is suggested that an intersectional approach to climate policy can account for these omissions and highlights the ways in which a more just, intersectional climate politics might be formulated.","[Wilson, Joanna] Univ Manchester, Polit Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Chu, Eric] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Wilson, J (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Polit Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Joanna.wilson@manchester.ac.uk,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Flavell, Joanna/0000-0002-8270-4196",,,,70,4,4,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Reducing wood burning emissions is a source-specific method to address air quality degradation, and indirectly climate change, through instituting policies aimed at human health co-benefits. In this work, we investigate and quantify the potential health co-benefits from policies reducing outdoor particulate matter (PM) pollution from residential wood burning by assessing the pollution conditions during the 2015 calendar year in Athens, Greece, emphasizing vulnerable populations. We conducted a systematic literature search to extract data regarding effective improvements to outdoor PM due to wood burning interventions, and get a range of potential ambient PM reduction estimates regarding realistic benefits from different interventions. We applied a health impact assessment methodology and used existing Athens specific data to calculate the preventable daily average non-accidental deaths associated with reducing PM, additionally considering low and high socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We found that the reduction in outdoor PM concentration showed the potential to benefit lower SES groups as much as 13.5 times more than the high SES group, representing an opportunity for policies to improve not only the health of the total population but also improve environmental equity and health disparities.","[Bailey, Jennifer; Benmarhnia, Tarik] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Gerasopoulos, Evangelos] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens, Greece; [Gerasopoulos, Evangelos] Navarino Environm Observ, Messenia, Greece; [Rojas-Rueda, David] Inst Salud Global Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Benmarhnia, Tarik] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Benmarhnia, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Benmarhnia, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",tbenmarhnia@ucsd.edu,"Rojas-Rueda, David/AAK-2184-2020","Rojas-Rueda, David/0000-0001-5854-2484; Bailey, Jennifer/0000-0003-3379-4938",EUEuropean Commission [689443]; University of California Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives [MRP-17-446315],This work was supported by EU Horizon 2020 Framework Program (grant agreement no. 689443) also partially funded by the University of California Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives (MRP-17-446315).,,35,5,5,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1093-4529,1532-4117,,J ENVIRON SCI HEAL A,J.

Resilience is proposed by experts as a solution to climate change vulnerability. But this prescription tends to focus on adaptation to future external threats, subtly validating embedded processes of racial capitalism that have historically dehumanised and endangered residents and their environments in the first place. This article focuses on majority Black areas said to be vulnerable to extreme weather events and targeted for expert-driven resilience enhancements in America's capital city, Washington, DC. Drawing on key insights from Black radical, feminist, and antiracist humanist thought, we reimagine resilience through an abolitionist framework. Using archival analysis, oral histories, a neighbourhood-level survey, and interviews conducted between 2015 and 2018, we argue that abolitionist climate justice entails a centring of DC's historical environmental and housing-related racisms, the intersectional drivers of precarity and trauma experienced by residents beyond those narrowly associated with climate; and an ethics of care and healing practiced by those deemed most at risk to climate change.","[Ranganathan, Malini] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Bratman, Eve] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Environm Studies, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA","Ranganathan, M (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",malini@american.edu; ebratman@fandm.edu,"Bratman, Eve/AAU-3643-2021","Bratman, Eve/0000-0002-0250-446X",Metropolitan Policy Center at American University,"We are indebted to the organisers, leaders, residents, and practitioners in Washington, DC interviewed for this research.

We expand on Sherry Arnstein's concern with the redistribution of power between the state and citizens by juxtaposing her ladder of participation with Nancy Fraser's framework of justice. Fraser's approach to justice seeks parity-defined as the social arrangements that enable people to participate as peers in public life-across economic, cultural, and political domains. Fraser provides principles to guide planners in determining what is just and unjust in participatory initiatives. Principles include ensuring proper participatory procedures, recognizing minority viewpoints and perspectives, attending to the framing of public issues, and remediating inequitable social structures. We illustrate the practical application of Fraser's justice framework by drawing on examples from public engagement with climate change. Takeaway for practice: Although Fraser does not provide a tool kit for action, we offer suggestions for how planners can apply a justice framework to improve participatory practice. Planners can a) require appropriate procedures to ensure that all relevant people and perspectives are represented at the appropriate scale; b) ensure all perspectives-not just dominant ones-are recognized and valued; and c) respond to and mitigate the inequitable distribution of wealth and resources.","[Blue, Gwendolyn; Rosol, Marit; Fast, Victoria] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Calgary, AB, Canada","Blue, G (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Calgary, AB, Canada.",ggblue@ucalgary.ca; marit.rosol@ucalgary.ca; victoria.fast@ucalgary.ca,,"Blue, Gwendolyn/0000-0003-3510-3248; Rosol, Marit/0000-0001-8059-0415; Fast, Victoria/0000-0002-7093-3864",,,,79,11,11,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

Based on a structured literature review, we interrogate such claims, asking whether such approaches may (or may not) contribute to social change and, more specifically, empowerment. We present a review of the predominant meaning and interlinkages of the EbA and empowerment concepts, which shows that EbA pays insufficient attention to issues of empowerment and agency. On this basis, we discuss how an empowerment lens could be (better) integrated into the conceptualization of EbA, suggesting key dimensions through which this could be supported. We show that the emphasis on empowerment theory and the merits that it brings to the EbA literature are helpful, leading to a number of important questions to adaptation projects on the ground. Incorporating an empowerment lens leads to an increased consideration of issues of power more broadly, especially the way marginalized groups' agency, access, and aspirations are conditioned by social structures that may prevent strategic adaptation choices. We conclude that EbA will facilitate empowerment better by explicitly considering how social benefits can emerge from the interplay between particular types of actions, marginalized people's adaptive strategies, and their relational context.","[Woroniecki, Stephen; Warnsler, Christine; Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden","Woroniecki, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",,,"Woroniecki, Stephen/0000-0003-1894-2859",Linnaeus Centre LUCID - Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research Council Formas,"The work was financially supported by the Linnaeus Centre LUCID, funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas.",,104,12,12,1,10,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

However, there is mounting evidence that adaptation and vulnerability are linked, such that ostensibly adaptive responses can have negative consequences and augment people's vulnerability. We analyzed several climate change responses at various scales and developed a typology of five discrete but related modes by which the vulnerability of already vulnerable populations is being [re]produced. Crucially, this work suggests that for at least one of these modes, the vulnerability of other groups is perversely inverted, such that relatively secure populations perceive themselves to be at risk. The cases we present illustrate that people's vulnerability is being used against them, or put another way, is being weaponized-exacerbating their precarity by excluding them from much needed and due assistance, while directing resources instead to bolstering the well-being of those already well-positioned to respond to climate threats. Our typology provides a theoretical intervention by illustrating how climate vulnerability and security are co-produced, as well as a practical tool to help decision makers to adopt more just and equitable climate policies.","[Thomas, Kimberley Anh] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Warner, Benjamin P.] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Thomas, KA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 308 Gladfelter Hall,1115 Polett Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",kimthomas@temple.edu,,"Thomas, Kimberley/0000-0002-9600-385X",,,,128,22,22,4,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Given the fluid and evolving language used in sexual and gender minority communities, it is crucial to examine how community members are named and who is centered as a result of this naming. The authors use the terms queer-spectrum and trans-spectrum to honor how individuals choose to identify themselves as opposed to placing them into socially constructed, fixed categories of sexuality and gender. Next, they explore how the climate has changed in higher education to support queer-spectrum and trans-spectrum students. Finally, the authors examine the research on how queer-spectrum and trans-spectrum students experience their campuses and the climate's influence on specific outcomes. This retrospective contends that higher education scholars must continue to examine outcomes that will facilitate success for queer- and trans-spectrum student populations.","[Rankin, Susan] Rankin & Associates Consulting, POB 576, Howard, PA 16841 USA; [Garvey, Jason C.] Univ Vermont, Higher Educ & Student Affairs Adm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Duran, Antonio] Auburn Univ, Adm Higher Educ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Rankin, S (corresponding author), Rankin & Associates Consulting, POB 576, Howard, PA 16841 USA.",sue@rankin-consulting.com,,"Rankin, Susan/0000-0003-4783-7556",,,,88,10,10,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0268-5809,1461-7242,,INT SOCIOL,Int.

The court thus confirms the first-instance Urgenda decision, which had attracted much attention worldwide and which serves as a model for a whole series of other climate change litigations, some of which have since failed, some are still pending or planned. Even bearing in mind the urgency of the climate protection goal pursued by these lawsuits, the idea of a world rescue through court decisions is ultimately misleading. It overestimates the power of the judicial branch and risks being lost in mere symbolism. Worse still, it shifts responsibilities and creates expectations that tend to further de-legitimize the constitutional democratic systems of the world and their concept of a separation of powers. Even from a solely environmental point of view, this constitutes a high risk, because there are no better alternatives of responsible government. Keeping this risk in mind, the fact that the specific Urgenda-decision is legally not convincing seems an almost minor aspect.","[Wegener, Bernhard W.] Friedrich Alexander Univ, Erlangen, Germany","Wegener, BW (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ, Erlangen, Germany.",bernhard.wegener@fau.de,,,,,,30,6,6,0,10,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1613-7272,1876-0104,,J EUR ENVIRON PLAN L,J.

Yet, actions taken to deliberately shift social-ecological systems towards more sustainable trajectories can have substantial social impacts and exclude people from decision-making processes. The concept of just transformations makes explicit a need to consider social justice in the process of shifting towards sustainability. In this paper, we draw on the transformations, just transitions, and social justice literature to advance a pragmatic framing of just transformations that includes recognitional, procedural and distributional considerations. Decision-making processes to guide just transformations need to consider these three factors before, during and after the transformation period. We offer practical and methodological guidance to help navigate just transformations in environmental management and sustainability policies and practice. The framing of just transformations put forward here might be used to inform decision making in numerous marine and terrestrial ecosystems, in rural and urban environments, and at various scales from local to global. We argue that sustainability transformations cannot be considered a success unless social justice is a central concern.","[Bennett, Nathan J.; Cisneros-Montemayor, Andres M.; Singh, Gerald G.; Sumaila, U.

Since the Industrial Revolution, the prospect of unlimited growth with the aim of jobs creation has been dramatically associated with a massive social-ecological degradation that puts the Earth system at risk. In recent decades, a number of heterodox theories and policies are reconsidering our relationship with work in view of contemporaneous social-ecological challenges. This paper offers critical review of five contrasting approaches. Those promoting green jobs' consider the possibility of transforming ecological constraints into economic opportunities by incentivising eco-efficient innovations and generating new jobs. Conversely, critical approaches, such as working-time reduction (WTR), labour environmentalism, political ecology of work, and contributive economy and justice, defend decommodifying work to liberate pro-social and pro-environmental behaviours. We additionally present two opposing scenarios mainly inspired by critical theories. One illustrates the root causes of systemic lock-in leading to the present social-ecological work-life degradation, while the other illustrates perspectives on the politics of free time' and contributive economy and justice oriented towards building capabilities, and workers' emancipation and justice in search for more sustainable relationships with ecosystems.","[Bottazzi, Patrick] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Bottazzi, Patrick] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Bottazzi, P (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.; Bottazzi, P (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",patrick.bottazzi@cde.unibe.ch,,"Bottazzi, Patrick/0000-0002-0431-802X",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [176736],This research was conducted with funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) Professorship grant number: 176736 (AGROWORK).,,115,3,3,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL 2,2019,11,14,,,,,,,3852,10.3390/su11143852,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IS6KX,WOS:000482261800097,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-08-07,

To date, most attempts to address this problem have taken a top-down approach in which international justice, legal and humanitarian frameworks are extended 'downwards' by policymakers and governments to local populations. However, there has been limited systematic work that emphasizes the abilities of affected peoples themselves to develop and formulate their own justice-based solutions. This paper presents an analytical framework for thinking about 'bottom-up' claims-making that emphasizes naming, blaming, claiming and framing. The framework enables claims-making to be distinguished from other forms of community-based agency, such as adaptation. The paper also suggests a normative framework to support policymakers and practitioners in helping communities facing displacement to make claims. The normative framework focuses on the barriers to, and opportunities for, claims-making 'from below'.","[Arnall, Alex] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Agr Bldg,POB 217, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Hilson, Chris] Univ Reading, Sch Law, Reading, Berks, England; [McKinnon, Catriona] Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Reading, Berks, England","Arnall, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Agr Bldg,POB 217, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England.",a.h.arnall@reading.ac.uk,,"McKinnon, Catriona/0000-0003-0434-1083; Arnall, Alex/0000-0001-6218-5926",,,,44,7,7,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Explicit integration of the macroecology of human systems and natural systems has been rare, but can advance the incorporation of social justice, environmental justice and environmental equity into conservation biology and participatory conservation (inclusion in decision-making of those who are affected by, or can affect, that decision). The basis of this strong link is the focus of macroecology on the relations of a given biota to environmental patterns and processes, and these patterns and processes can affect humans differentially. Macroecological integration of social justice and conservation generally requires spatial and temporal representation of all variables at resolutions and extents that allow meaningful analyses. This requirement may facilitate clarity about social metrics and norms. To illustrate, we examine applications of macroecology to analysis of the effects of climate change on social justice and biological conservation; relations among climate, violence among humans and conservation; and the response of the spread of disease to social and ecological factors. We believe that macroecology is a means of providing transparent inferences that can inform conservation, health and social policies.","[Fleishman, Erica] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Brown, Holly] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","Fleishman, E (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",erica.fleishman@colostate.edu,,,,,,54,2,3,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

While political leaders convened to negotiate a new climate treaty, a diverse landscape of social movements, grassroots organizations, activists and artists assembled to mobilize public support for climate justice. In this paper we draw attention to one example of such non-traditional climate mobilization: Run for Your Life, organized by the Swedish theater company Riksteatern. Framed as a climate performance, this initiative enrolled thousands of people to run distances in a relay race for climate justice, starting in Arctic Sweden and arriving in Paris on the first day of COP21. Public events were organized along the way, and the entire race was video recorded and broadcasted online. When signing up, runners were asked to submit their own climate story. Drawing on this archive of personal stories, we examine how Run for Your Life mobilized citizen engagement for climate justice. By paying attention to the multiple ways in which climate change is storied into people's lives, we seek to understand why citizens decide to take climate action and which subject positions are available to them in the broader environmental drama. While the scripting of climate change as a planetary emergency perpetuated by global injustices serves an important function in the politics of climate change, we argue that it is in situated stories of environmental connection that climate change gains personal meaning. Here, kinship and solidarity are articulated, opening up for progressive social change.","[Kaijser, Anna; Lovbrand, Eva] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden","Kaijser, A (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",anna.kaijser@liu.se,,,Seedbox: An Environmental Humanities Collaboratory; Swedish Research Council Formas and MistraSwedish Research Council Formas,This study was funded by the Seedbox: An Environmental Humanities Collaboratory.

Mainstream scholars and practitioners do not very often acknowledge environmental and social justice in their transitions work. They seldom recognize rights for racially marginalized people, or the possible existence of rights of Earth. Nor do they query whether they are exaggerating the reach of scientific and technological solutions. By contrast, some recent ecological science fiction writing has begun to place these issues at the center of transitions. In the Broken Earth series, N.K. Jemisin explores Earth through the lens of racial and ecological injustice. She interrogates four themes relevant to transitions. How should we live in a climate-changed world? What role does racial and social subordination play in destroying the environment? What are the dangers of hubris in seeking out a fundamental change through science and technology that cannot be readily controlled after all? How should we think about Earth itself?

It introduces key trends in coal consumption, production and trade, before reviewing the relevant literature. Finding surprisingly little literature directly focused on coal and climate change, it appraises existing work and highlights key areas for future research. In addition to established literatures on the situated politics of coal and the political economy of coal, new work calling for demand side policies to be supplemented with supply side policies highlights the increasing importance of normative contestations in driving debates over coal. This suggests that scholars must engage much more directly with climate change as an issue, and particularly with the place of coal in a just transition. Because of coal's mammoth contribution to climate change and the complex political economy which drives its production and consumption, it is likely that coal will remain at the center of difficult questions about the relationship between climate action and development for quite some time.

We characterize the agreement as an attempt to solve a common-pool resource social dilemma and draw on Elinor Ostrom's seven 'design principles' as a conceptual framework. Using data from 43 interviews and 265 mail surveys, we find a split between farmers who grudgingly accept the agreement as necessary to keep the region's agricultural productivity sustainable, and those who consider it unnecessary, unfair, or even illegal. A belief in the importance of protecting groundwater resources and support for local control was cited by farmers backing the agreement, whereas dissenting farmers believed outside interests had exerted too much influence throughout the negotiation process and generally mistrusted the state's groundwater data. Given that residents of the American West are likely to continue having to address declining water availability in the future due to climate change, our findings can help policymakers design effective and equitable water policies in a way that advances rural environmental justice.","[Running, Katrina; Burnham, Morey] Idaho State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Criminol, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [Du Bray, Margaret, V] Augustana Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Rock Isl, IL 61201 USA","Running, K (corresponding author), Idaho State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Criminol, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",runnkatr@isu.edu,,"du Bray, Margaret/0000-0002-4295-3550; Burnham, Morey/0000-0001-5716-9964",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIA-1301792],This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [IIA-1301792];,,57,3,4,3,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

Drawing on a case study in Lam Dong province and applying an environmental justice lens, we examine how various social actors assert claims over forests and how these claims invoke different notions of justice, authority and identity. Our analysis highlights that the development and implementation of the project has generated renewed competing claims and conflicts over forests among social actors. Underlying these conflicts there are incompatible notions of justice and associated rights, which lead different actors to accord legitimacy variously to the global norms brought about by REDD+, the customary resource practices of indigenous people, or to the state's laws. We show that the negotiations over forests in REDD+ reflect the influence of the specific historical and political-economic settings in which REDD+ activities take place, including pre-existing conflicts over forests and power relations underpinning forest management. From a policy perspective, our research suggests that any attempts to introduce simplified and uniform regulations for forest governance in REDD+ should be avoided, since local institutions and conceptions of justice will significantly influence what is regarded as legitimate policy and can thus be endorsed as inspiration for sustainable forest governance.Key policy insights REDD+ in Vietnam has spurred contestations over who is legitimately entitled to govern and manage forests.Claims and conflicts over forests can be explained by incompatible and distinct notions of justice, authority and identity.Contestations over justice pose radical challenges to any global and national efforts that attempt to implement simplified rules and ideas for forest based-climate change mitigation.Attention to justice, especially to compatibility and differences in ideas about justice, is crucial for sustainable forest governance.","[Cam Hoang] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Inst Cultural Studies, 27 Tran Xuan Soan, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Satyal, Poshendra] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Corbera, Esteve] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Barcelona, Spain","Hoang, C (corresponding author), Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Inst Cultural Studies, 27 Tran Xuan Soan, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hoangcamvn@gmail.com,"Corbera, Esteve/C-5368-2015","Corbera, Esteve/0000-0001-7970-4411","'Conflict and Cooperation over REDD+ in Mexico, Nepal and Vietnam' project - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; UK Department for International Development [W07.68.415]; Danida Fellowship Center [13-08KU]; UAB-Banco de Santander Talent Retention Programme; ICTA-UAB 'Unit of Excellence' [MinECo] [MDM2015-0552]","This research was funded by the 'Conflict and Cooperation over REDD+ in Mexico, Nepal and Vietnam' project, supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and the UK Department for International Development [grant number W07.68.415].

As many millions of people are expected to be displaced in the coming decades, scholars and policymakers are searching for precedence to inform their research and planning, particularly from experiences of Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement (DIDR). Nowhere in the world is DIDR and other closely related forms of planned resettlement more prevalent than in China: an estimated 78 million people have been displaced by development projects over the last six decades. While planned resettlement has consistently been shown to cause impoverishment, the Chinese state views it as the answer to a multitude of social ills including poverty, environmental damage, low levels of domestic consumption, and most recently, climate change, providing impetus to the normalisation of resettlement as adaptation. This paper examines the prospects for just outcomes in resettlement projects by examining distributive justice at multiple scales in existing resettlement practice in China. It finds that due to the interplay between resettlement and questions of procedural justice, prospects for just outcomes are quite limited, and that in order to achieve fair adaptation, alternatives to planned resettlement should be emphasised.","[Wilmsen, Brooke] La Trobe Univ, Dept Social Inquiry, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Rogers, Sarah] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Contemporary Chinese Studies, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Wilmsen, B (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Social Inquiry, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",b.wilmsen@latrobe.edu.au; rogerssm@unimelb.edu.au,"Wilmsen, Brooke/O-6333-2017","Wilmsen, Brooke/0000-0002-0970-7673",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE120101037],"Brooke Wilmsen gratefully acknowledges Australian Research Council Grant DE120101037 that partly funded this research.

These perspectives remain dominant, particularly in policy and media circles, despite academic critique and the recent emergence of more diverse approaches. In this intervention, we contribute to the recent turn in environmental migration research by seeking to better ground and pluralize our understanding of how environmental change and human mobility relate. We do so by offering a mobilities perspective that centers on the practices, motives, and experiences of mobility and immobility in the context of environmental change: When and why do people decide to move-or not to move-in response to environmental changes? How do they cope with migration pressures? Where do they move, under what conditions, and who can or must stay behind? This approach attends to the diverse aspirations and differential capabilities that underlie particular practices of movement or nonmovement, reflecting both individual characteristics as well as interconnections with uneven power relations across local, regional, and global scales. A mobilities approach offers a starting point for an expanded research agenda on environmental im/mobilities. This enables academic analysis and policy discussion of the human (im)mobility-environmental change nexus to become better attuned to the actual practice and heterogeneous needs of those affected.

This article aims to outline a balanced appreciation of the particular responsibility held by transnational oil and gas companies in the global challenge to organize an equitably managed decline in fossil fuel extraction. It does so by focusing on a case study. The latter consists of the stylized reconstruction of the internal social dynamics that shape the power structure of the French firm Total and of questioning its ability to make investment decisions aligned with the imperative to preserve the stability of the climate system, as its public position makes clear. The persistence of short-termed compensation schemes in the higher corporate hierarchy impedes the elaboration and implementation of deep decarbonization strategies at the firm level. These would imply a significant upscaling of investments in renewable energy and/or carbon-capture storage technologies, in order to avoid the foreseeable destruction of corporate jobs linked to oil and gas extraction in an increasingly carbon-constrained world.","[Choquet, Pierre-Louis] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England","Choquet, PL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",pierrelouischoquet@gmail.com,,"Choquet, Pierre-Louis/0000-0002-2565-1657",Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial support by the Economic and Social Research Council when the author was a DPhil student was a decisive support in the realisation of this research project.",,114,1,1,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

The increase in urbanization, the movement of people from rural communities relocating into urban areas, the issue of population density, and a rise in extreme weather are all contributing to these challenges. Although natural and manmade disasters have always existed, the increase in urbanization as a result of the movement of people into urban areas, the resulting increase in population density, and a rise in frequency of extreme weather events are factors that contribute to these challenges. There is a growing field of evidence that individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted by disasters due to factors such as exposure to the elements, lack of resources and services, as well as disenfranchisement, and stigma associated with homelessness, all while experiencing greater occurrences of environmental injustice. The shrinking support for funding such services, increasing income inequality between classes, and cultural justifications for criminalizing poverty and homelessness contribute to our collective understanding of disaster vulnerability when experiencing homelessness. Given that there are distinct needs for individuals experiencing homelessness when affected by disasters, this article proposes recommendations for improving policy, research, and services to address these disparities. Trends in income inequality and homelessness have serious implications for planning and response, and recovery from natural or manmade disasters. As such, there is a need to periodically review progress, identify current gaps and unmet needs, and identify opportunities for improvement.","[Gibson, Allison] Univ Kentucky, Coll Social Work, 619 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Gibson, A (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Coll Social Work, 619 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",allison.gibson@uky.edu,"Gibson, Allison/P-3492-2017","Gibson, Allison/0000-0002-4116-9465",,,,46,5,5,2,12,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

It also showed that high-income areas, located in the peri-urban zones of the city, enjoy a better climate, environment, and air quality. This article analyzes urban climate injustice, as evidenced by the sharp socioeconomic differences in the quality of environment to which urban residents are exposed, and highlights the need for public spaces to improve the environmental quality for residents.","[Smith, Pamela] Univ Chile, Dept Geog, Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile; [Smith, Pamela] FONDECYT Iniciac 11180990, Santiago, Chile; [Smith, Pamela] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Santiago, Chile; [Smith, Pamela] Red Pobreza Energet RedPE, Santiago, Chile; [Henriquez, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Geog, Santiago, Chile; [Henriquez, Cristian] Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CEDEUS, Santiago, Chile; [Henriquez, Cristian] Ctr Cambio Global UC, Macul, Chile","Smith, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Geog, Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile.",pamelasmit@uchilefau.cl,,,CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Fondecyt de IniciacionComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11180990],"We thank the eight students from the University of Biobio for their valuable contribution in the survey and assistance with fieldwork.

Among these, an emblematic example is the project Parque Varzeas do Tiete (PVT) or Tiete Lowlands Park a 75 km-long floodplain restoration scheme proposed by the government of Sao Paulo, Brazil, to allegedly solve the city's flooding problem. The project's execution, however, is contingent on the removal of approximately 7500 low-income families, raising questions on the intertwined relationship between adaptation to flooding and the exclusion of informal urban settlements. Drawing on urban and feminist political ecology, we use the PVT as a case study to examine the politics and uneven outcomes of adaptation in Sao Paulo's eastern periphery. We combine archival and ethnographic work to expose the persistent politics of invisibility that sustain the project's exclusionary contours. In the process, we also demonstrate the various ways floodplain residents reshape their invisibility to contest, negotiate, and resist the PVT in the spaces of their everyday lives. As a result, the analysis identifies the project's perverse effects but also opportunities for productive engagements between the government and local communities towards more just, inclusive, and equitable adaptation futures in Sao Paulo, and beyond.","[Henrique, Karen Paiva; Tschakert, Petra] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Henrique, KP (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",karen.paivahenrique@research.uwa.edu.au,,"Henrique, Karen Paiva/0000-0002-2163-2854; Tschakert, Petra/0000-0002-4268-3378","Australian GovernmentAustralian GovernmentCGIAR; University of Western Australia, Australia","We would like to thank Aparna Parikh and Clare Mouat for their insightful comments in the development of this manuscript.

A critique of resilience and climate-resilient development,GEOFORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Resilience; Vulnerability; Climate justice; Climate change; Development,INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY; COLLECTIVE ACTION; POST-POLITICS; SOCIAL-CHANGE; JUSTICE; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY; POLICY; POWER; PERSPECTIVE,"Over the last two decades, resilience has steadily gained traction in discussions on the theory and practice of adaptation to climate change. The concept is widely considered useful for explaining how coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) resist climate-related stressors or undergo change. At the same time, however, there has been an upswell of critique on resilience and climate-resilient development, stemming most prominently from the quarters of political ecology and human geography. This article seeks to contribute to this literature by using the analytical lens of post-politics to critically evaluate resilience and climate-resilient development in a local adaptation context. Four major critiques are lodged against resilience: (1) its inability to sufficiently recognize the large-scale political, economic, and social forces affecting and effecting change, (2) its oversight of the analyzed systems' internal dynamics, (3) the depoliticized, techno-managerial nature of resilience-centered solutions, and (4) the theoretical vagueness of resilience as applied by development actors. The paper presents a grounded critique of the term based on empirical evidence collected through a quasi-ethnography of a climate change adaptation project implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government in Sao Tome and Principe. It is argued that resilience, despite its theoretical attractiveness and growing popularity among donors, continues to dehumanize development and renders adaptation post-political. The article also discusses alternative, more human-centered approaches rooted in vulnerability and climate justice, which offer a more nuanced lens through which to analyze climate impacts and the associated challenges that they pose at the local level.","[Mikulewicz, Michael] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland","Mikulewicz, M (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",michael.mikulewicz@gcu.ac.uk,,,"University of Manchester President's Doctoral Scholar Award; School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED)","This research was supported by the University of Manchester President's Doctoral Scholar Award (2014-2017); and fieldwork allowance from the School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED).",,148,14,14,4,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,AUG,2019,104,,,,,,267,282,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.05.010,,,16,Geography,Geography,IN5GO,WOS:000478704100025,,Green Accepted,,,2021-08-07,

At the same time, this post-political thesis has been challenged for not taking the multiplicity of voices and actually existing forms of contestation into account. In this paper, I investigate the tension between these two positions and show that the existence of diverging voices and environmental struggles does not disprove the post-political thesis as such. I do this both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Theoretically, the paper presents a rereading of post-foundational theory and its implications for dealing with climate change. Empirically, the paper is based on activist research in the Transition Towns and Climate Justice Action movements, which have variably been depicted as profoundly political and depoliticised. The paper argues that it is often overlooked that it is on the level of discourse or representation that the diagnosis of post-politics should be made. It is not reality as such which is post-political, but the way reality is portrayed and thereby constructed. On this basis, I argue that post-politics is a real problem for climate movements and that the attempt to overcome it is not only a necessity but also a profound challenge for them.","[Kenis, Anneleen] Kings Coll London, Soc & Environm, London, England; [Kenis, Anneleen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Fdn Flanders FWO, Leuven, Belgium","Kenis, A (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England.",Anneleen.Kenis@kcl.ac.uk,"Kenis, Anneleen/AAV-1460-2021","Kenis, Anneleen/0000-0002-6106-6340",,,,58,19,19,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-6544,2399-6552,,ENVIRON PLAN C-POLIT,Env.

This paper argues that such transformations are firstly required in modernist practices that militate against sustainability due to their constitution by the fallacy of human control. The latter points to the conceit of suppressing uncertainties in knowledge, commandeering agency from above', standardising governance, harming marginalised ecologies and disqualifying practices inferiorised as primitive', irrational' or vernacular'. Undoing the fallacy of control,by admitting uncertainties,modernist practices may become caring through transformative engagement with others. I propose four aspects of such transformative engagement: (a) egalitarian commitment to distributing epistemological privilege; (b) ontological sensitivity, by taking seriously the relational bases of others' knowing; (c) learning for divergence from others; and (d) affinity in alterity across widening divergence. These aspects are proposed not as fully formed principles, but rather as questions to be reworked in ongoing encounters and struggles for sustainability and climate justice. The aim is to nurture other-than-modern understandings of climate challenges and to help build multiple coexisting pathways of resilience, adaptation and mitigation.","[Arora, Saurabh] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton, E Sussex, England","Arora, S (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",s.arora@sussex.ac.uk,,,"ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/N011414/1, ES/I021620/1]","I thank Andy Stirling and Catherine Will for comments on a previous draft.

Their vulnerability to climate change arises in part from their contexts of living in many of the harshest and isolated environments. Their resilience originates from their accumulated knowledge of specific environments over millennia, mediated through sui generis cultural institutions. Our results illustrate that indigenous groups primarily perceive uncertainties related to volition of actors and institutions. When they are involved in climate adaptation planning in ways that mobilise their cultural institutions and knowledge, they can safely manage these uncertainties through their agency to determine and control key risks. We demonstrate that climate justice approaches can be strengthened for indigenous peoples by applying a linked vulnerability-resilience analytical framework. This enables stronger consideration of how unique cultural institutions and knowledge, which are not available to all vulnerable groups, affect indigenous perceptions of uncertainty in climate adaptation planning. We use this analytical approach in a case study with Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groups within the Great Barrier Reef Catchment. We conclude that a specific focus on sui generis indigenous knowledge and cultural institutions as a source of resilience can strengthen climate justice approaches and work more effectively with indigenous peoples in climate change contexts.","[Lyons, Ilisapeci; Hill, Rosemary] CSIRO, Land & Water, POB 12139, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Hill, Rosemary] James Cook Univ, Div Trop Environm & Soc, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Deshong, Samaria] Koinmerburra Aboriginal Corp, Manunda, Qld, Australia; [Mooney, Gary] Yuibera Aboriginal Corp, Mackay, Qld, Australia; [Turpin, Gerry] Dept Sci Informat Technol Innovat & Arts, Cairns, Qld, Australia","Lyons, I (corresponding author), CSIRO, Land & Water, POB 12139, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",Ilisapeci.Lyons@csiro.au,"Lyons, Ilisapeci L/I-3085-2013; Hill, Rosemary/A-6954-2011","Hill, Rosemary/0000-0002-7426-3132",CSIRO Indigenous Futures; NESP Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub; CSIRO Great Barrier Reef Intiatives,I would like to acknowledge the programs that funded open access of our paper.

Important problems face their efforts, especially what is called the problem of inconsequentialism. The problems, I argue, arise largely from the failure to treat individual obligations as a matter of justice, a failure that stems from the common modern assumption that justice primarily concerns social institutions. I develop an alternative approach by appealing to the account of justice as a virtue in Thomas Aquinas. This approach allows us to talk about individual obligations to reduce emissions as obligations of justice, even in the current context of institutional failure. At the same time, I argue that approaching climate change in Thomistic terms requires an important modification of Aquinas's understanding of justice.","[Darr, Ryan] Yale Univ, Dept Religious Studies, 451 Coll St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Darr, R (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Religious Studies, 451 Coll St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",ryan.darr@yale.edu,,,,,,25,3,2,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0953-9468,1745-5235,,STUD CHRIST ETHICS,Stud.

This paper uses insights from environmental feminist and decolonial knowledge politics to challenge knowledge systems analysis to explicitly question and alter structures of power in environmental knowledge making in North American cities. If knowledge systems analysis can investigate and intervene in governance structures through which environmental decision- and policy-making happen, this necessitates reflection on ontological, epistemological and ethical commitments (or `starting points') as these carry material and discursive weight: they open up and foreclose ways in which resilience is practiced. Given increasing recognition that urban resilience needs to consider issues of justice and equity, in this paper we take cues from feminist and decolonial scholarship that has centered these themes for decades and which offer 'starting points' to rethink knowledge systems for resilience. Understanding urbanization as key process in the expansion of relations fundamental to the production of anthropocentric climate change, we argue that changing these relations is crucial if urban resilience planning is to contribute to alternative and socially just urban futures. Against tendencies of depoliticization that solutions-oriented work can sometimes exhibit, feminist and decolonial perspectives locate knowledge-making practices squarely within struggles for social justice in the city. We propose three strategies for those working on knowledge systems for resilience to advance their practice: centering justice and transgression, reflexive research practice, and thinking historically. Ultimately, this paper shows that taking seriously critical social sciences furthers fundamentally new ideas for what transitions to urban resilience could mean.","[Wijsman, Katinka] New Sch Univ, Urban Syst Lab, 79 Fifth Ave Room 1605, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Feagan, Mathieu] Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Urban Resilience Extremes Sustainabil Resilience, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Wijsman, K (corresponding author), New Sch Univ, Urban Syst Lab, 79 Fifth Ave Room 1605, New York, NY 10003 USA.",Katinka.wijsman@newschool.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1444755],"We are thankful for the National Science Foundation's support for the Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (project #1444755).

The research uses the unique Woodside area in Glasgow as a case study. The project, 'Connecting Woodside', is a first of its kind in Scotland and lessons learned can be applied elsewhere. The study found that, to effectively utilise GI to assist place-making and add value in public realm developments, community engagement is a key aspect in developing public spaces. One of the main reasons identified for this was that GI was highly location specific. Therefore, it is important to understand the needs and wants of a place and its communities.

This study focuses on the local perspective and examines how climate justice was represented in three Indian newspapers during COP21 (Paris, 2015) and COP22 (Marrakech, 2016). It utilizes the selected Indian news media content and reveals that the newspapers have emphasized on the harm avoidance justice during the international climate conferences when an emphasis on the burden sharing dimension was instead expected. The publications strongly criticize rich countries for the emissions but less vigorously criticize the local authorities who are responsible for containing pollution and emissions. This finding along with the emphasis on the harm avoidance signifies the growing importance of local environmental issues in global deliberations.","[Das, Jahnnabi] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia","Das, J (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",Jahnnabi.Das@uts.edu.au,,"Das, Jahnnabi/0000-0001-7870-2350",,,,63,1,1,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

There is, however, an urgent need to critically interrogate new discourses linking population size with climate change and promoting agricultural and reproductive technologies as a means to address associated problems. This article analyses the specific discourses produced by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in relation to these 'population technologies' and 'climate-smart' agriculture in particular. Drawing on concepts and approaches developed by Black, postcolonial and Marxist feminists including intersectionality, racial capitalism, social reproduction, and reproductive and environmental justice, we explore how within these discourses, the 'geo-populationism' of the BMGF's climate-smart agriculture initiatives, like the 'demo-populationism' of its family planning interventions, mobilises neoliberal notions of empowerment, productivity and innovation. Not only do these populationist discourses reinforce neoliberal framings and policies which extend existing regimes of racialised and gendered socio-spatial inequality, but they also underwrite global capital accumulation through new science and technologies. The BMGF's representations of its climate-smart agriculture initiatives offer the opportunity to understand how threats of climate change are mobilised to reanimate and repackage the Malthusian disequilibrium between human fertility and agricultural productivity. Drawing upon our readings of these discourses, we critically propose the concept of 'necro-populationism' to refer to processes that target racialised and gendered populations for dispossession, toxification, slow death and embodied violence, even while direct accountability for the effects of these changes is dispersed.

The target is having a global plan of action, aiming at universal peace and social and environmental justice. For this, 169 goals were drawn. The objective of this research is to discuss the congruence between mining activity and the SDG, starting from experiences of the scientific literature and the observation of one mining activity. For this purpose, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were used, with the keywords sustainable development goals and mining. The Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) Portal was used to search papers that relate each one of the SDG to mining. Visits were made to three crushed stone mining industries, located in Monsenhor Gil, Piaui, Brazil, in order to follow the production process of the diabase mineral. From the research in the literature, it was possible to verify that there are several possibilities of reaching the 17 SDG in the mining sector, such as in the promotion of jobs (SDG 8), contributing to the reduction of poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2), among others. From the visits, it was observed that the compliance with SDG related to the promotion of jobs, the improvement of income for community's residents, and the infrastructure of the environment are common to all mining or business activities that reach remote and poor areas. This is clear when identifying mining regions that have lost their economic importance once the local development ceases. If the visited industries left the place, it would cause great loss to the residents that depend on them for their jobs. There is a small number of women on the staff, setting up disrespect for SDG 5 regarding the achievement of gender equality. The nature of the activity itself does not justify the asymmetry that possibly happened under the influence of a sexist culture that imposes what is a man's job or a woman's job. Another point is the lack of investment in inclusive education for employees and for residents of the region. In addition, these industries do not recover the degraded areas, compromising the achievement of SDG 13, in regard to combat climate change and its impacts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to disrupt this securitization of climate policy, we draw on the insights of feminist geopolitics and what Koopman calls alter-geopolitics to consider how contemporary grassroots movements like the Sanctuary movement and #BlackLivesMatter have made connections between political, economic and environmental vulnerabilities while developing relationships of solidarity and care that broaden, disseminate, distribute and regenerate security as an expansive and inclusive project.

The influence of linear positivist models of science uptake are proving ineffective in a world with increasingly concentrated wealth and power, institutional barriers, and rapidly growing risks facing the many. A plurality of approaches is needed to better examine those dynamics of climate adaptation which are often invisible in models of science uptake - equity, the value of contestation, path dependency - and to consider how to empower communities to find solutions. In this conceptual paper, we argue that bridging existing positivist and interpretivist methods with insights from post-foundational theory so as to underpin pluralism and re-orient ethical principles of justice, strengthens the capacity of social research to support transformative climate adaptation.

Might they have a claim to assistance from the international community if these losses come to pass? If so, on what basis? I examine two distinct arguments for assistance. The first is based on the claim that when our expectations are thwarted by public policy, compensation for those affected may be morally required. The second is premised upon the right to development - a right which is potentially jeopardised when some fossil fuel assets must go unexploited. I argue that the second argument enjoys better prospects.

More specifically, the ecological crises identified by Amin in the form of global warming and climate change have created an unprecedented global environmental threat capable of unifying diverse social strata across the planet. The climate justice movement has already established a global infrastructure and template to coordinate a new international organization for confronting neoliberal forms of globalization. Pre-existing movement organizing around environmental racism, climate justice in the global South, and recent intersectional mobilizations serve as promising models for building an enduring international organization that will represent subaltern groups and have a substantial impact on world politics.","[Almeida, Paul] Univ Calif, Dept Sociol, Merced, CA 95343 USA","Almeida, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Dept Sociol, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",palmeida@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,38,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-7731,1474-774X,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,NOV 10,2019,16,7,,,SI,,973,979,,10.1080/14747731.2019.1651518,,AUG 2019,7,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,IY0LS,WOS:000482485800001,,Bronze,,,2021-08-07,

The situation in the US is more polarised, with the Republican Party almost uniformly denying the existence of climate change and any human impact on rising global temperatures. Instead of taking scientific reports on impacts, risks and adaptation to climate change seriously, the Trump administration is focused on increasing US production of oil, natural gas and coal.

Similarly, emerging technologies raise new threats along with new possibilities. Finally, external world-threatening events (e.g. oncoming asteroids) remain an ever-present option for human extinction. A business-as-usual paradigm, where competitive nations care little for the environment and social justice is all too often constrained by those in power, makes one of these outcomes inevitable. Examples are drawn from science fiction as well as the scientific literature to illustrate several of the various possible paths to self-destruction and make them more relatable.

Despite a longstanding and impassioned environmental movement, these problems persist and are worsening. The extent and degree of human-induced change on the planet is significant enough to have placed us in a new geological age: the Anthropocene. Three perspectives are engaged as a way to understand this new era and address our fractured human-nature relationship: (1) political ecology, (2) the ecological humanities, and (3) the informal economy. An exploration of intersecting themes leads to the start of a new theoretical contribution, which manifests at the convergence of theories: a whole-of-community approach. This whole-of-community approach is one that is concerned with both inter-human and interspecies relationships to move us towards communities that are place-based, integrated, participatory, and grounded in eco-social justice and equity. Pollinating bees are used as an illustrative example of how to achieve this vision. Bees can be both a bridge and gateway. As a bridge, they can provide a way of (re)connecting human and nonhuman nature and as a gateway, they can guide humans to a deeper understanding and connection with urban natures. Reconciling humans with the rest of the biotic community through place-based initiatives is possible by fundamentally and radically expanding our current framing of the concept of community.","[Marshman, Jennifer] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Marshman, Jennifer] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Laurier Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada","Marshman, J (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.; Marshman, J (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Laurier Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",jmarshman@gmail.com,,,,,,170,1,1,1,6,LYSON CENTER CIVIC AGRICULTURE & FOOD SYSTEMS,ITHACA,"295 HOOK PL, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA",2152-0798,2152-0801,,J AGRIC FOOD SYST CO,J.

This is particularly true of South Asia, which contains dense populations certain to be adversely affected by climate change. This contribution explores the way religion shapes and mediates responses to disaster in Pakistan. Where previous work in this field has focused on extremists and militants, mine considers currents of lived Islam that take explicit stances on questions of natural resource development. Drawing upon extensive primary data, I identify two distinct disaster cosmologies permeating state and society. First, I consider the official Islam of experts and policymakers, whose approach to development is derived from, but arguably surpasses the modernism of British and American colonial and Cold War paradigms in its dogmatic, faith-based belief in the imperative of mastering and exploiting nature. The second is an altogether contrasting formation embedded in a political protest movement representing a marginalized constituency, the Siraiki speaking population of Southern Punjab, which mobilized flood affectees in the aftermath of the 2010 floods around issues of social and environmental justice.","[Ahmad, Ali Nobil] Leibniz Zentrum Moderner Orient, Berlin, Germany","Ahmad, AN (corresponding author), Leibniz Zentrum Moderner Orient, Berlin, Germany.",ali.nobilahmad@zmo.de,,,,,,58,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-1909,1467-6443,,J HIST SOCIOL,J.

Many resilience frameworks are grounded in concepts initially developed by ecologists to describe and explain the capacity of complex systems, such as a community, to persist or return to its original state following disturbances. As a result, much of the research on resilience is concerned with maintaining systems in their current form, preventing degradation, or promoting recovery. However, for a system that is stuck in a trap, or an unfavorable state, deliberate efforts to build the components that contribute to resilience, called adaptive capacities, may enable that system to reorganize after a disturbance to reach a more favorable state. Objective: The purpose of this research was to apply a resilience framework to analyze how the community of St. Gabriel, Louisiana adapted in response to environmental change. Methods: We used qualitative case-study methodologies to systematically collect newspaper articles, which served as primary data sources to examine how resilience and adaptive capacity evolved in the community of St. Gabriel, Louisiana. Results: Key events in the recent history of St. Gabriel include industrial development, growing concern about environmental health and pollution, the environmental justice (EJ) movement, and the incorporation of the community as a self-governing municipality. Two events, the community's organized resistance to a large hazardous waste facility and the change in government structure, represent critical transformations, or fundamental changes in how the community functions. Conclusion: The incorporation of St. Gabriel gave community members more input in planning and development decisions. As a result, the community has taken steps to improve public health in the form of zoning ordinances to prevent new exposure risks and building community infrastructure, such as a new sewer system and a recreation center.","[Irving, Jennifer K.; Reams, Margaret] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Irving, JK (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",jirvin6@lsu.edu,,,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program [P42 ES013648],"We would like to thank the Louisiana Environmental Action Network for providing information about their involvement with St. Gabriel and hosting the community workshop that inspired this research.

Such a transition requires that the interests and needs of workers and their communities be taken into consideration to make sure they do not bear the heaviest part of the burden in terms of loss of jobs and means of survival, and that they are prepared to face the new, post-carbon labour environment. The concept of Just Transition was coined to describe both the socio-political project put forward by trade unions in response to climate change, and the recognition by climate activists that the livelihoods and security of workers and their communities must be ensured during the transition to a post-carbon society. However, just transition movements are divided between two quite different orientations, which are labelled affirmative and transformative. On the one hand, affirmative just transition advocates envisage a transition within the current political-economic system. Transformative just transition activists, on the other hand, envisage a post-capitalist transition. This article, drawing upon an extensive case study of the Portuguese climate jobs campaign, goes beyond showing how these orientations shape the positions taken by union and climate activists. The article also analyses how the conflicts and cooperation between these key actors can shed light on the possibilities and/or limitations of just transition as a framework for the collective action needed to achieve rapid, deep decarbonisation of economies in the Global North context.","[Kenfack, Chrislain Eric] Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Kenfack, CE (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",kenfack@ualberta.ca,,,,,,49,1,1,1,8,MCMASTER UNIV,HAMILTON,"1280 MAIN ST W, HAMILTON, ON, CANADA",1918-6711,,,GLOB LABOUR J,Glob.

Study design and methods: We examined UN and World Health Organisation guidance on A SDGs and other published texts on systems thinking, integration, universality and co-benefits. Results and conclusions: The UN SDGs are a set of globally agreed objectives to end poverty, protect all that makes the planet habitable and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social), they apply to high-income countries as well as developing countries and there are mechanisms to hold countries to account. There are three crucial issues for public health. First, a systems approach to future proof health and social justice. Second, an evidence-based approach to aid communication, framing and engagement. And, third, the importance of interventions that deliver health co-benefits (i.e. both immediate and long-term benefits to health, equity and prosperity).

Concurrently, water-centered technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling have facilitated the rapid and widespread growth of unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production in the United States. Water markets are increasingly touted as the best, most efficient, and fairest mechanisms for allocating vital and scarce resources. Yet this contention is largely unexplored at the food-energy-water nexus, particularly from an environmental justice perspective-where equitable water access for all users is a central concern. We utilize a case study in Colorado's South Platte basin based on 41 in-depth interviews to show: (1) distortions created in regional water markets as wealthy UOG operators participate in them and (2) ways in which access to water markets becomes blocked for smaller, newer, or water-poor water users. We also highlight how UOG producers' presence may inhibit the formation of alternative systems for water exchange. Thus, the participation of UOG operators in Colorado's water markets appears to drive environmental injustice and increased inequity at the food-energy-water nexus, rather than facilitating fair or efficient access to water for all users.","[Malin, Stephanie A.; MacIlroy, Kelsea] Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Malin, SA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, B234 Clark Bldg,Campus Mail Stop 1784, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",stepha-nie.malin@colostate.edu,,,"Water Center at Colorado State University; Water Center Faculty Fellowship, Colorado State University","We thank the Water Center at Colorado State University for its support of this vital research.

We first review recent normative work on the idea of representing future people in climate governance: The grounds on which it has been advocated, and the main difficulties that traditional forms of representation have encountered when applied to this particular case. We then survey existing institutional means to represent generations to come. We separate out representation in courts, in parliament, and by independent bodies, and review specific instruments including climate litigation, parliamentary commissions, future representatives, youth quotas, and independent offices for future generations.

In its deliberate guise - as climate geoengineering - such intervention is highly contentious, threatening to profoundly reshape the geography and politics of environmental governance frameworks, not to mention the nature of the environments towards which those frameworks are oriented. Yet, even as experiments with geoengineering technologies are growing in number, geographers continue to engage seldom with scientific, political or indeed public debates about them. In this paper we contend that geographical ideas about space, scale, power and geopolitics must urgently be brought to bear on ongoing efforts to experiment with geoengineering, and to deliberate its future role in responses to climate change. We develop this argument in two parts. First, we suggest that ongoing debates about the acceptability of geoengineering experimentation would benefit from recognising incumbent spatial and scalar categorisations (e.g., small scale vs. large scale, indoors vs. outdoors) not as fixed ontological anchors, but as relational and provisional constructs, open to being rethought in new, potentially productive ways. Second, we call for geographers to document and contest inequalities and injustices, both in debates about what geoengineering is or might become, and in the outcomes generated by efforts to undertake geoengineering in practice. Here there are opportunities for geographers to reshape the frames of reference used by others to comprehend the implications of the Anthropocene itself, drawing on traditional disciplinary strengths in ecofeminism, political ecology and environmental justice, as well as the production of space and critical geopolitics. Such endeavours, we contend, will form a vital complement to existing geographical engagements with the concept of the Anthropocene, reaffirming the value of the discipline's distinctive - and explicitly normative - voice within ongoing policy and public deliberations.","[Bellamy, Rob; Palmer, James] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Oxford, England; [Bellamy, Rob] Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Palmer, James] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Bellamy, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Oxford, England.; Bellamy, R (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England.",rob.bellamy@manchester.ac.uk,,"Palmer, James/0000-0002-1151-1485; Bellamy, Rob/0000-0001-9592-705X",,,,49,4,4,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,SEP,2019,51,3,,,,,524,531,,10.1111/area.12495,,,8,Geography,Geography,IN4WE,WOS:000478676900016,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2021-08-07,

Using a case study approach, we analyze program documentation, partnership evaluation questionnaires, and HHH steering committee meeting notes. We describe the CBPR process by which we successfully collected research data in Detroit during summer 2016, engaged in collaborative analysis of data, and shared results with Detroit residents. Evaluations of the partnership over 2 years show community involvement in research; enhanced capacities; success in securing new grant funding; and ways that CBPR strengthened the validity, relevance, and translation of research. Engaging communities as equal partners using CBPR, even after a study is underway, can strengthen research to understand and address the impacts of extreme heat on health and equity in urban communities.","[Ziegler, Todd B.; Coombe, Chris M.; O'Neill, Marie S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rowe, Zachary E.] Friends Parkside, Detroit, MI 48213 USA; [Clark, Sarah J.; Palacios, Angelina] Southwest Detroit Environm Vis, Detroit, MI 48209 USA; [Gronlund, Carina J.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lee, Michelle] Jefferson East Inc, Detroit, MI 48207 USA; [Palacios, Angelina] Univ Michigan, Coll Literature Sci & Arts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Larsen, Larissa S.] Univ Michigan, Taubman Coll Architecture & Planning, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Reames, Tony G.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schott, Justin] EcoWorks, Detroit, MI 48219 USA; [Williams, Guy O.] Detroiters Working Environm Justice, Detroit, MI 48201 USA","O'Neill, MS (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",marieo@umich.edu,"Reames, Tony G./AAV-3989-2021; Gronlund, Carina/A-9253-2018","Reames, Tony G./0000-0002-0738-8525; Gronlund, Carina/0000-0002-0533-745X","Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, Michigan Lifestage Environmental Exposures & Disease Center (NIEHS grant) [P30ES017885]; Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research [UL1TR002240]; Ginsberg Center for Community Service Learning; National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1520803]; NIEHS grant [K99ES026198]; NIOSH grant [T42 OH008455]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR002240] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USANational Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) [T42OH008455] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [R00ES026198, P30ES017885, K99ES026198] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was funded by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, Michigan Lifestage Environmental Exposures & Disease Center (NIEHS grant P30ES017885), Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research (UL1TR002240), the Ginsberg Center for Community Service & Learning; National Science Foundation grant 1520803, NIEHS grant K99ES026198 and NIOSH grant T42 OH008455.",,45,5,5,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In addition to overt forms of economic power and influence, hegemonic power is central to the fossil fuel industry's regime of obstruction. Based on 29 interviews and an analysis of third-party teaching resources, this article shows how teaching practices and resources work to centre, legitimize, and entrench a set of beliefs relating to climate change, energy, and environmentalism that align with the interests of fossil fuel industry actors in Saskatchewan, Canada. We argue that these pedagogical practices promote student subjectivities consistent with neoliberal environmentalism centred on individual actions designed to insulate fossil fuel industries from criticism and dissuade young people from questioning or understanding the role of corporate power in the climate crisis. Furthermore, this petro-pedagogy intends to restrict the imagination of possible climate solutions to individual acts of conservation that fail to challenge the structural growth of fossil fuel consumption.

There is a lack of large-scale systematic analyses of citizens' preferences for environmental protection by relevant government levels and the social structuration of such attitudes. This article aims first to assess associations between desire for local government to improve environmental protection, and socioeconomic status and air pollution; second, to identify indirect associations mediated by citizens' awareness of pollution. The research was based on nationally representative survey data from 2014. Results show the lowest occupational class as less likely than higher classes to mention environmental protection when asked which local government services should increase, but as likely to express environmental risk awareness. Policymakers should consider mechanisms such as social protection, inclusion and environmental justice to enhance local environmental policy desire among lower classes and facilitate effective environmental governance.","[Flato, Hedda] Univ Oslo, Dept Culture Studies & Oriental Languages, Oslo, Norway","Flato, H (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Culture Studies & Oriental Languages, Oslo, Norway.",heddafl@ikos.uio.no,,,"Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [240060, 225132]; Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs",This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council under Grant Numbers 240060 and 225132; and by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.,,92,6,6,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

It also throws light on how understanding structural vulnerability can help to emphasize social justice concerns while adapting to climatic risks. The research, using qualitative methods, examines complex intersections between a multitude of factors such as climate change, agrarian distress, exclusionary patterns of urbanization and the resultant lack of recognition that shapes and reshapes the vulnerability of a certain group of people.

Social work students (N = 724) from programs throughout the country were surveyed about their environmental beliefs and behaviors. An ordinary least squares regression indicated that holding more liberal political beliefs, identifying as a nonreligious individual, placing greater personal importance on environmental issues, participating in environmentally conscious behaviors, espousing greater confidence in scientists' understanding of climate change, and being older were associated with greater environmental concern, and these variables explained 51.5% of the variance. Greater inclusion of environmental justice and avenues for advocacy that create social change should be part of the social work curricula if practitioners who are ready for this area of practice across the micro-macro continuum are to be developed.","[Chonody, Jill M.] Boise State Univ, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Sultzman, Vickey] Indiana Univ Northwest, Gary, IN USA; [Hippie, Jennifer] Indiana Univ Northwest, Clin, Gary, IN USA","Chonody, JM (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.; Chonody, JM (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Northwest 3400 Broadway Ave, Gary, IN 46408 USA.",jillchonody@boisestate.edu,,,,,,45,0,0,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-7797,2163-5811,,J SOC WORK EDUC,J.

The results of the paper suggest the United States of America and the United Kingdom have the highest number of papers in relation to women and the city, and in considering the period 1977-2019, the highest number of papers were published in the past 10 years. The knowledge gaps and debates which left behind are presented in five discussion documents which can be used for future research. These five documents include debates on the health and safety of women in cities; economic studies representing labour, migrants and poverty; social justice debates, and the road to the right to the city. The fifth document, at the end of this paper, presents a typology based on three aspects: theories of women in urban studies, 'the theoretical debate'; the designer's efforts create urban spaces in order to achieve urban inclusivity, 'the form-of-city debate'; and the inclusion of women in future urban development planning processes together with emerging gender planning theory, 'the planning process debate'.","[Moghadam, Seyednavid Mashhadi; Rafieian, Mojtaba] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran","Rafieian, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",Mashhadimoghadam@modares.ac.ir; Rafiei_m@modares.ac.ir,,"Mashhadi Moghadam, Seyed Navid/0000-0002-3082-1331",,,,344,2,2,0,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0197-3975,1873-5428,,HABITAT INT,Habitat Int.,OCT,2019,92,,,,,,,,102047,10.1016/j.habitatint.2019.102047,,,21,Development Studies; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Development Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration; Urban Studies,JK5NH,WOS:000494889600006,,,,,2021-08-07,

Agroecology is being promoted as an approach that can address multiple crises in the food system while addressing climate change and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. Beyond the more technical definition as, the ecology of food systems, agroecology has a fundamentally political dimension. It is based on an aspiration towards autonomy or the agency of networks of producers and citizens to self-organize for sustainability and social justice. In this article, we use the multi-level perspective (MLP) to examine agroecology transformations. Although the MLP has been helpful in conceptualizing historic transitions, there is a need to better understand: (a) the role of and potential to self-organize in the context of power in the dominant regime, and (b) how to shift to bottom-up forms of governance-a weak point in the literature. Our review analyzes the enabling and disabling conditions that shape agroecology transformations and the ability of communities to self-organize. We develop the notion of 'domains of transformation' as overlapping and interconnected interfaces between agroecology and the incumbent dominant regime. We present six critical domains that are important in agroecological transformations: access to natural ecosystems; knowledge and culture; systems of exchange; networks; discourse; and gender and equity. The article focuses on the dynamics of power and governance, arguing that a shift from top down technocratic approaches to bottom up forms of governance based on community-self organization across these domains has the most potential for enabling transformation for sustainability and social justice.","[Anderson, Colin Ray; Chappell, Michael Jahi; Kiss, Csilla; Pimbert, Michel Patrick] Coventry Univ, Ctr Agroecol Water & Resilience, Wolston Lane, Coventry CV8 3LG, W Midlands, England; [Bruil, Janneke] Cultivate, Schuurhoven 29, NL-6721 SM Bennekom, Netherlands; [Chappell, Michael Jahi] Inst Food & Dev Policy, Food First, 398 60th St, Oakland, CA 94618 USA","Anderson, CR (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Ctr Agroecol Water & Resilience, Wolston Lane, Coventry CV8 3LG, W Midlands, England.",colin.anderson@coventry.ac.uk; janneke@cultivatecollective.org; jahi@foodfirst.org; ab8083@coventry.ac.uk; ab4781@coventry.ac.uk,"Chappell, Michael Jahi/E-9398-2010","Chappell, Michael Jahi/0000-0001-8542-1610",,,,171,37,39,4,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT 1,2019,11,19,,,,,,,5272,10.3390/su11195272,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JI5RS,WOS:000493525500131,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

People disagree, however, about the relative importance of these two reasons. This article develops an institutional view to address this issue, which consists of two claims. First, many emissions of greenhouse gases that took place before the establishment of legitimate institutions of global climate governance do not give rise to climate-related duties. Second, the absence of legitimate institutional global governance, more generally, undermines full rights to wealth on the part of developed states and thus removes an objection to their having to contribute more to tackling the challenges of climate change.

Despite a change from a top-down burden-sharing approach to a bottom-up pledge and review regime, concerns of distributive justice remain central to the evolution of climate research, regime, and policy. The Paris Agreement also proposes a new market-based mechanism to promote ambition. Reasserting the unavoidability of climate justice' concerns, and responding to the suggestion that the proposed new market-based mechanism could learn from the experience of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), this paper argues that such a recommendation should be tested against a comprehensive understanding of compatibility between justice and the market. This paper postulates that both justice and the market have institutional underpinnings, which embed them into deeper, and interconnected, layers of values and relations. Arguing that climate justice' is best understood as an agreed ensemble of values,' we propose that the architecture of the UNFCCC in which these values are articulated, negotiated, and agreed upon needs to be conceptualized as consisting of four distinct, but evolving, institutional spheres: ambition, obligations and entitlements, mechanisms, and deliberation. The approach is illustrated using the case of the CDM, and implications are suggested for the proposed market-based mechanism under the Paris Agreement. The paper argues that the concerns of climate justice' have multiple institutional dimensions, and the market-based mechanisms may contribute to realizing certain dimensions of climate justice,' while considerably subverting others. The extent of both outcomes depends greatly on the agreed' conception of justice, design of mechanisms, and capabilities of the participants. Our findings suggest a judicious combination of non-market mechanisms with the market-based mechanisms would better serve the desired goal.","[Shrivastava, Manish Kumar] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Environm & Energy Dept, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi, India; [Bhaduri, Saradindu] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Studies Sci Policy, New Delhi, India","Shrivastava, MK (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Environm & Energy Dept, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi, India.",manish.shrivastava@terisas.ac.in; saradindu@jnu.ac.in,"Shrivastava, Manish Kumar/AAQ-7961-2020",,,,,73,2,2,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In this vein, the inclusion of innovative research and innovation policies, such as Responsible Research and Innovation, devoted to mainstream social outcomes, to deploy democratic governance of science, and to drive innovation into a direction that is ethically acceptable, societally desirable and sustainable are noteworthy. However, substantial efforts are required when it comes to integrate the interactions between renewable energy research and energy and climate policies within responsible approaches. In order to adapt responsible research and innovation approach for the purpose of building an alternative context and assessment approach for sustainable transitions, this paper presents a review of approaches around sustainability and social justice dimensions. The thresholds of this endeavour are detailed in terms of the challenges for the integration, the identification of the inhibitors and facilitators of policy integration and the proposal of the levels for a methodology for this integration. The results show that the different readings and understanding of the contexts and dimensions and the existence of knowledge gaps between policy targets and the outcomes of research and innovation can be considered inhibitors for the integration. In contrast the interlinks between dimensional concepts, backgrounds and rationales appear as facilitators. The innovative contribution of this paper is focused on the contextualization of the dimensions through the use of socio-technical and multi/inter/trans and cross-disciplinary approaches. The authors conclude that the process of introducing a more holistic and alternative approach opens the re-envision of policy elements. Moreover, RRI offers an innovative perspective to the transition approach as well as tools for decision-making and policy processes assessment, in an arena where constant innovation is taking place and new structures, processes and metrics are necessary to guide this process.","[Carbajo, Ruth; Cabeza, Luisa F.] Univ Lleida, GREiA Res Grp, INSPIRES Res Ctr, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain","Cabeza, LF (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, GREiA Res Grp, INSPIRES Res Ctr, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain.",lcabeza@diei.udl.cat,"Cabeza, Luisa F./B-4587-2013","Cabeza, Luisa F./0000-0001-5086-872X",Spanish governmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [ENE2015-64117-C5-1-R]; Catalan Government [2017 SGR 1537],The work presented was partially funded by the Spanish government (ENE2015-64117-C5-1-R (MINECO/FEDER)).

However, when wind energy projects encroach on indigenous peoples' lives and land, there is often a lack of recognition and participation of these peoples and an unequal distribution of cost and benefits of such projects toward them, which leads to opposition against wind energy projects and often triggers conflicts for justice. Worryingly, such conditions have repeatedly resulted in the assassination of human rights defenders, which further inflames the conflict. Herein, I discuss these concepts based on a longitudinal study centered on a wind energy project in Oaxaca, Mexico, with the aim of exploring and understanding the conditions under which wind energy investments fail to respect current laws and norms, as well as the consequences of such negligence. My in-depth analysis of the actions of the government, businesses, and indigenous peoples revealed a phenomenon that is less discussed in environmental (in)justice research: the gradual and continuous transformation of indigenous peoples' norms and behaviors away from their traditional economic and cultural livelihoods. This phenomenon helps to extend the conceptual understanding of environmental (in)justice with regard to social turbulence, which is defined as the unpredictable behavior of political and social systems in contexts in which existing laws, regulations, and norms regarding environmental justice are not observed. The concept of social turbulence of environmental (in)justice helps to explain how indigenous peoples sacrifice their territories, norms, and traditions to a technical solution to climate change and sustainable development.","[Ramirez, Jacobo] CBS, Dept Management Soc & Commun MSC, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Ramirez, J (corresponding author), CBS, Dept Management Soc & Commun MSC, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jara.msc@cbs.dk,"Ramirez, Jacobo/E-9162-2017","Ramirez, Jacobo/0000-0002-2479-3266",,,,74,3,3,3,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

Gender in the climate change literature is predominantly vulnerability and adaptation centric, with a glaring gap in research on understanding the relationship between mitigation and gender justice. Building on the insights from gender justice, environmental justice, and climate justice scholarship, this paper argues that mitigation policy should be conceived not only in terms of transition to a low carbon economy but also as an instrument for enhancing gender justice. To conceptualize such a mitigation policy, we propose a two-step approach, combining the works of Schlosberg, Fraser, and Sen. We argue that, to start with, it is important to identify relevant forms of exclusion, and then, in turn, to identify opportunities for ?parity of participation? of women in the mitigation policy cycle. This must be supplemented with identification of, and efforts at, building long-lasting supporting capabilities. Application of the proposed approach is illustrated through three examples from India: the National REDD+ Strategy, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna (PMUY) for cleaner fuels, and the International Solar Training Programme (Solar Mamas). We illustrate how the Solar Mamas scheme is closer to the proposed two-step approach and hence better integrates mitigation and gender justice objectives, whereas the REDD+ and the PMUY need revisiting with additional provisions and reconceptualization. The paper suggests that mainstreaming of gender justice into implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement is a promising new field of research. Key policy insights Failure to consider gendered barriers to meaningful participation of women may limit the effectiveness of even women-centric mitigation policies in achieving their stated objectives. It is possible to at least nudge the social drivers of gender injustice by identifying and creating opportunities for addressing the androcentric foundations of exclusion and marginalization of women. Mitigation policies offer unique opportunities to go beyond highlighting the structures of gender injustices embedded in socio-economic systems to break the stereotypes of gendered-roles by recognizing women as key stakeholders and claimants in the new low-carbon society. This would require reconceptualizing capacity building for mitigation.","[Michael, Kavya; Hakhu, Arunima; Bajaj, Kavya] Energy & Resources Inst, Earth Sci & Climate Change Div, New Delhi, India; [Shrivastava, Manish Kumar] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Energy & Environm, New Delhi, India","Shrivastava, MK (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Energy & Environm, New Delhi, India.",manishipta@gmail.com,"Michael, Kavya/AAC-4846-2020; Shrivastava, Manish Kumar/AAQ-7961-2020","Hakhu, Arunima/0000-0002-3469-2768; Bajaj, Kavya/0000-0003-1175-7044; Shrivastava, Manish Kumar/0000-0003-4746-2686",Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek) [11Q5714N],"This research is a part of a research project titled 'Developing Country Participation in Addressing Climate Change: Research on Policy Instruments for Achievement of India's NDCs', funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [grant number 11Q5714N].",,111,4,4,4,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

To date, however, there is limited theoretical and empirical understanding about how discourses, practices and politics of climate responsibility might be enacted in the urban context. This gap is particularly significant in the Asia Pacific - a region characterised by high rates of economic growth and rapid urbanisation alongside extreme poverty and exposure to the effects of climate change. This article explores the politics of urban climate responsibility in two cities - Hong Kong and Singapore. Based on empirical research with NGOs, it considers if and how cities have a responsibility to act on climate change, how such responsibility may be configured within the city, and the role of international and regional dynamics in creating and maintaining climate responsibility. The article reframes the contested and contingent geographies of urban climate responsibility through the dimensions of attribution, production and spatialisation before drawing out implications for climate justice and resilience in the Asia Pacific region.","[Fuller, Sara] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Fuller, S (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",sara.fuller@mq.edu.au,"Fuller, Sara/A-4640-2014","Fuller, Sara/0000-0002-9830-1615",Macquarie University [MQNS 9201501508],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research received funding from Macquarie University (MQNS 9201501508).",,55,2,2,2,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2020,57,7,,,SI,,1469,1484,4.2098E+13,10.1177/0042098019872347,,OCT 2019,16,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,LN4MU,WOS:000491543900001,,,,,2021-08-07,

Despite this, successive governments have struggled to implement policy to tackle this issue. Using the case of opposition to the Clean Energy Act, passed in Australia to establish an emissions trading scheme, this paper argues that a growing and broad sentiment of distrust in political elites, described as 'anti-politics', can explain some of this contradiction. Particular forms of climate policy, in particular emissions trading schemes, have been successfully framed as policies that appeal to the interests of a new class of liberal elites while hurting ordinary working people. This frame was used successfully in Australia by conservative forces to oppose the Clean Energy Act. While used cynically by political leaders in this case, the paper argues that anti-political sentiment reflects genuine concerns about the detachment between the state and voting population. This detachment is reflected in neoliberal climate policies. Through briefly examining the cases of the Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Gilets Jaunes protest movement, the paper argues that while formulating climate policy we must consider anti-political sentiment, developing responses to the climate crisis from a bottom-up rather than top-down approach.","[Copland, Simon] Australian Natl Univ, Acton, ACT, Australia","Copland, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Hayden Allen Bldg, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",simon.copland@anu.edu.au,,"Copland, Simon/0000-0003-4705-3532",,,,78,4,4,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0896-9205,1569-1632,,CRIT SOCIOL,Crit.

People in the indigenous climate justice movement agree resolutely on the urgency of action to stop dangerous climate change. However, the qualities of relationships connecting indigenous peoples with other societies' governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations are not conducive to coordinated action that would avoid further injustice against indigenous peoples in the process of responding to climate change. The required qualities include, among others, consent, trust, accountability, and reciprocity. Indigenous traditions of climate change view the very topic of climate change as connected to these qualities, which are sometimes referred to as kin relationships. The entwinement of colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization failed to affirm or establish these qualities or kinship relationships across societies. While qualities like consent or reciprocity may be critical for taking coordinated action urgently and justly, they require a long time to establish or repair. A relational tipping point, in a certain respect, has already been crossed, before the ecological tipping point. The time it takes to address the passage of this relational tipping point may be too slow to generate the coordinated action to halt certain dangers related to climate change. While no possibilities for better futures should be left unconsidered, it's critical to center environmental justice in any analysis of whether it's too late to stop dangerous climate change.

To understand how these calls may be useful requires exploring how they are mediated by both global and national climate governance architectures. Globally, the Paris Agreement architecture is premised on a learning by doing logic that prioritizes experimentation. National governance mechanisms have emerged in reaction to such international processes, but are deeply shaped by local contexts. National systems differ in the narratives on which they are based, their institutional forms, and the resultant interests mobilized. Specifically, they differ in the centrality of climate change itself to national narratives of action and, instead, often embed climate motivations within other national objectives. As a result, calls for enhanced ambition can have different effects depending on how they are framed, and therefore how amenable they are to being internalized nationally. In particular, ambition understood predominantly as enhanced quantitative pledges could yield perverse outcomes truncating the learning by doing dynamic of the Paris Agreement; returning the focus of global political attention disproportionately to a burden-sharing discussion; creating incentives for gaming pledges; and stretching scarce implementation capacity in the developing world. More flexible framings that can harness ambition to accelerated experimentation, broader coalitions, and synergies with other objectives can be fruitful. Questions such as is it too late? are useful if they encourage action and learning by doing; less so if they shift attention to future intent over current action.

Proposed as one of the largest new coal mines in the world, the Adani (or Carmichael) mine has become a flashpoint between two broad coalitions-the pro-mine coalition, consisting of governments, elements of the media, and mining interests, and the anti-mine coalition, consisting of community groups, environmental non-government organisations, activists, Indigenous communities, and farmers. Based on thematic analysis of news media articles and interviews with environmental actors in the Adani mine controversy, this article demonstrates how each coalition employs discursive scale frames and counter-scale frames to represent and contest the controversy. We find that the pro-mine coalition remains situated within a topographical spatiality, with a backwards oriented temporality, that obscures emergent topologies from their view. In contrast, while retaining capacity for operating within traditional scalar topographies, the anti-mine coalition is more adept at negotiating topologies that increasingly define our social worlds. It is oriented towards a deep future horizon in which the Adani mine controversy represents an opportunity to reshape existing social and political orders. The sorts of scalar tactics documented here are likely at work in other resource extraction controversies, highlighting the need to attend to how scale may be being used to obscure irrationalities and injustices in extraction projects, and the potential for counter-scale frames to help destabilise fossil fuel regimes.","[Jolley, Connor; Rickards, Lauren] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Jolley, C (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",connor.jolley@rmit.edu.au,,"Rickards, Lauren/0000-0001-6088-3448; Jolley, Connor/0000-0002-8679-3907",,,,142,4,4,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1745-5863,1745-5871,,GEOGR RES-AUST,Geogr.

Such responsiveness is likely to allow advances in our understanding of how behavior changes and what meaning those changes have for individuals and society.","[Miller, Kristin L.] Juvo Autism & Behav Hlth Trivalley Antipoverty Co, 1200 Concord Ave Ste 100, Concord, CA 94520 USA; [Cruz, Alicia Re; Ala'i-Rosales, Shahla] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX USA","Miller, KL (corresponding author), Juvo Autism & Behav Hlth Trivalley Antipoverty Co, 1200 Concord Ave Ste 100, Concord, CA 94520 USA.",Kristin.Miller@juvobh.com,,,,,,90,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1064-9506,2376-6786,,BEHAV SOC ISSUES,Behav.

However, more critical analysis could enhance how well climate services align with the needs of society. Collaborations between Native American Tribes (Tribes) and Climate Science Organizations (CSOs) providing decision-support for climate change planning accentuate the potential for climate services to have social justice implications through either deepening or softening existing inequities. This paper compares 30 Tribe-affiliated and 36 CSO-affiliated individuals' perceptions about potential harms and benefits associated with their collaborations with one another. The importance of the potential benefits of collaborations listed outweighed the potential harms listed for both groups, but while climate science organizations rated the potential benefits listed slightly higher than Tribes did, the potential harms listed were much more salient for Tribes. This finding highlights concerns that, without proper training and management, these collaborations may reinforce unequal relationships between settler and Indigenous populations. While CSOs appeared cognizant of their Tribe-affiliated colleagues' concerns, transitioning from a focus on building trust to establishing and sustaining shared systems of responsibilities might help these collaborations meet the needs of both groups more effectively.

However, it can also lead to the unjust dislocation of the urban poor whose contributions to climate change are negligible but whose exposure to climatic risk is high. These groups of people also have little say in the decision-making about whether to retreat, when and how, thus raising concerns about equity and justice. In this paper, I examine the policy and practice of managed retreat and its environmental justice dimensions in Manila (Philippines) and Lagos (Nigeria) from 2010 to 2018. Expert interviews, focus group discussions, and policy documents were collected and analyzed for both cities. Findings reveal a complex picture of contradictions. In Lagos, retreat was stated in climate change policy but in practice only the urban poor were forcibly removed from waterfront areas and in their place new urban development projects are being constructed. In Manila, retreat was not mentioned in policy but evidence indicates informal settlers and national government offices were the target of planned retreat. Unlike Lagos, the urban poor in Manila were offered a mortgaged pathway to homeownership outside the city. However, the lack of livelihood opportunities in relocation sites engendered a cycle of retreat and return. This study further discusses how climatic uncertainties, property values, government distrust, utopian imaginaries, and environmental injustices served as barriers to managed retreat in both cities. The paper concludes with a call for an environmentally and socially just approach to retreat. It argues that the rights of the urban poor to the city must be taken into consideration even under complex climatic and socio-ecological disruptions.","[Ajibade, Idowu] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Ajibade, I (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",jajibade@pdx.edu,,"Ajibade, Idowu/0000-0002-9767-0435",Portland State University,Funding for this research was provided by the Portland State University (faculty enhancement grant).,,80,13,13,5,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This article is a contribution to the formulation of a useful role for normative theorising in light of this bounded nature of climate justice. We outline a theory of pure procedural climate justice; its content, function in relation to international climate diplomacy, and justification. The theory is 'pure' in the sense that it does not rely on an independent criterion of what are just outcomes in negotiations of climate responsibilities. Rather, it specifies procedural fairness norms, such as transparency, reciprocity and participation, which make the process of negotiation fair independently of which account of substantive climate justice happens to be correct. Such procedural fairness norms are justified in part by being expressions of an ideal of a reasonable negotiator, an ideal which itself commands respect. They are also justified as means to an effective coordinated response to dangerous climate change in virtue of their capacity to create trust, predictability and accountability.","[Brandstedt, Eric] Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, Box 192, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Brulde, Bengt] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Philosophy Linguist & Theory Sci, Box 200, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Brandstedt, E (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Philosophy, Box 192, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",eric.brandstedt@fil.lu.se; bengt.brylde@filosofi.gu.se,,"Brandstedt, Eric/0000-0001-6671-3802",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [437-2014-6692]; project CeCAR at University of Gothenburg,"Eric Brandstedt's work on this article was made possible by grant number 437-2014-6692 from the Swedish Research Council.

We focus specifically on learning to teach through creating mathematics problems in/for STEM and social justice. As a collaborative research group we are from five countries with varied cultural backgrounds, teaching experiences, and academic pathways. Dialogue as method is used to examine experiences of creating problems through which students can interpret and transform the world. Data collected included 46 h of audio-recorded dialogue meetings, 26 developed problems, and 7 interviews with 12 students. Results indicate creating mathematics problems in/for STEM involved navigating between mathematics, social justice, and STEM across all education levels and is supported with critical dialogue across cultural perspectives, diverse experiences, and expertise. Challenges lived include questioning the content of mathematics and STEM, deepening our own expertise to draw upon local and global problem contexts, and interrogating who benefits from such problems. Our study highlights the need for continued collaborative dialogue that not only gathers educators across disciplines but also includes students as co-creators of mathematics problems that could change their relationship with the world.","[Nicol, Cynthia; Yaro, Kwesi; Chen, Arthur; Amoah, Emmanuel] Univ British Columbia, Fac Educ, 2125 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bragg, Leicha A.] Deakin Univ, Melbourne Campus,221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Radzimski, Vanessa] Univ Fraser Valley, Dept Math & Stat, Bldg G,1st Floor,Room G161, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada","Nicol, C (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Educ, 2125 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",cynthia.nicol@ubc.ca,,"Bragg, Leicha/0000-0003-0579-4244",,,,49,2,2,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-9690,1863-9704,,ZDM-MATH EDUC,ZDM-Math.

However, while research is increasingly moving away from understanding the relationship between gender and climate change in a linear, technocratic, and instrumental way, gender and climate change policy-makers and project practitioners are having difficulties operationalizing this progress. In the meantime, as climate change effects are increasingly felt worldwide, and because the policy context after the Paris Agreement (2015) is bringing new challenges for gender and equity concerns, (re-)politicizing the climate justice debate in a policy and project-relevant way is more crucial than ever. My aim in this article is to contribute to this endeavor by exploring how a feminist political ecology framework applied to a specific case study in Nicaragua one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world can generate new policy and project-relevant lessons and insights from the ground that can in turn strengthen the conceptual debate on gender and climate change adaptation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2013 and 2014, as well as eight years of professional experience as a development worker in Nicaragua, I discuss the workings of power in the feminist political ecology of climate change adaptation; in so doing I raise new questions that will, I hope, lead policy-makers and project practitioners to explore how adaptation processes could open up the conceptual possibility for emancipation, transformation, and new ways of living life in common.","[Gonda, Noemi] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden","Gonda, N (corresponding author), POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",noemi.gonda@slu.se,,,Central European University Foundation; Central European University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"This research was partially supported by the Central European University Foundation, a full PhD scholarship by the Central European University, as well as a post-doctoral fellowship by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

This paper argues that such futures run through entangled Indigenous and Ethnic minority worlds in white settler cities but are often explored separately. To entangle these worlds, I introduce and develop the concept of affective ecologies or sentient embodiments of ecological interdependency grounded in everyday urban life. The paper draws on in-depth interviews, focus groups, archival photographs as well as participatory photographs/video/films taken by racialised Indigenous peoples, ethnic minority migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Darwin, a tropical north Australian city. I braid stories of co-becomings with this Saltwater Country prone to anthropogenic climate change by focusing on two events Loving Country and Listening to Old Man Rock.

Transformational approaches have also been integrated into the global climate change regime under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of the workplan of the Executive Committee guiding the implementation of the Warsaw international mechanism, the oversight body on loss and damage. However, there has as yet been no attempt to define what is meant by transformation in the context of loss and damage. This paper attempts to clarify the burgeoning academic and policy literature by positing three types of transformation as a response to loss and damage: transformation as adaptation (an intensification of dominant socio-ecological relationships), transformation as extension (when the limits of established adaptive capacity are reached) and transformation as liberation (adopting development pathways that address the root causes of vulnerability). Transformation as liberation is proposed as a deeper change to social-technological systems to avoid and minimize loss and damage in ways that enhance social justice and sustainability. To provide the kind of information decision makers need to plan and implement transformation as liberation, more research is needed on how to plan in a way that ensures the most equitable outcomes. Key policy insights Loss and Damage is an opportunity to scrutinize and address the root causes of vulnerability. Framing climate change as a development crisis will allow opportunities for transformation as liberation to emerge. Transformation as liberation to address the root causes of vulnerability requires meaningful engagement with processes at all levels. A new model of global governance is needed in which global equity is a moral imperative. The transition to transformation as liberation must be just, which requires leadership, inclusive and participatory decision making and building alliances. The global Loss and Damage agenda could open up space for a broader discussion on how transformation as liberation can be facilitated to address inequalities both between and within countries.","[Roberts, Erin] Kings Coll London, London, England; [Roberts, Erin; Pelling, Mark] Overseas Dev Inst, London, England","Roberts, E (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London, England.; Roberts, E (corresponding author), Overseas Dev Inst, London, England.",roberts.erin@gmail.com,,,,,,96,6,6,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

With flexibility, however, comes the potential for the clustering of greenhouse gas emissions. To understand whether emissions trading leads to localized clustering of emissions changes, we perform a systematic, spatio-economic assessment of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We analyze the spatial pattern of emissions changes from individual plants across the EU as well as how the pattern changes during the first two phases of the ETS implementation. Our findings indicate that there was clustering of emissions changes at the EU and country level which peaked at the start of the second phase but declined as the EU ETS matured. We also found that iron and steel, coke ovens, and refining have greater clustering and volatility compared to other industries. Based on the air quality implications of these clustered emissions, certain countries and industry types might need additional attention during the ETS design or redesign process. This study makes a novel contribution by systematically evaluating the spatio-temporal and equity implications of emissions distribution in cap-and-trade systems.","[Stuhlmacher, Michelle] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Lattie F Coor Hall,975 S Myrtle Ave,POB 875302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Patnaik, Sanjay] George Washington Univ, Strateg Management & Publ Policy, Sch Business, Funger Hall 615,2201 G St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Streletskiy, Dmitry] George Washington Univ, Geog & Int Affairs, Samson Hall,2036 H St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Taylor, Kelsey] George Washington Univ, Dept Geog, Samson Hall,2036 H St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Stuhlmacher, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Lattie F Coor Hall,975 S Myrtle Ave,POB 875302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",michelle.stuhlmacher@asu.edu; spatnaik@gwu.edu; strelets@gwu.edu; ktaylor_@gwu.edu,"Streletskiy, Dmitry/C-3333-2017","Streletskiy, Dmitry/0000-0003-2563-2664",,,,39,8,8,3,28,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Grassroots movements focused on energy justice and energy democracy focus on: (1) resisting the power of large multinational fossil fuel energy companies that exacerbate inequities and disparities in energy, (2) reclaiming the energy sector with more community and public control to redisitrbute benefits and risks, and (3) restructuring the energy sector to prioritize equity and justice with community ownership and distributed governance. This research analyzes women's leadership by focusing on how two women-led, non-profit organizations are advancing the renewable energy transition, operationalizing the concept of energy democracy and contributing to the energy justice movement. The two organizations are Grid Alternatives, a solar installation and workforce training organization, and Mothers Out Front, an advocacy organization focused on addressing climate change by promoting a transition to renewable energy. These organizations differ in their mission and approaches, yet both intentionally link climate and energy action with other forms of social justice activism, by expanding community engagement, strengthening participation, and fundamentally redistributing power to promote a transition to more equitable, resilient and sustainable energy systems. This paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of gender in energy justice and energy democracy movements, and to the practical consideration of the role that women's leadership is playing in accelerating energy system change and advancing the principles of energy justice and energy democracy.","[Allen, Elizabeth; Lyons, Hannah; Stephens, Jennie C.] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, 360C Renaissance Pk,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Stephens, JC (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, 360C Renaissance Pk,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",j.stephens@northeastern.edu,,,Northeastern University's Global Resilience Institute,The authors thank representatives of Mothers Out Front and Grid Alternatives for their responsiveness and engagement.

Despite a plethora of scientific evidence to support its existence, some are still skeptical. Although individuals debate whether climate change is real, vulnerable populations are bearing the brunt of the impact as glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes has broken up, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner. As temperatures continue to rise, precipitation patterns change, droughts and heat waves become even more common, hurricanes become more intense, sea levels keep rising, and the Arctic becomes ice-free, poor people and people of color are losing their lives and/or their livelihoods. A number of policies have mandated that countries slow down the climate change process. The United Nations and the profession of social work have made recommendations and set goals related to climate change. However, it seems as if climate change is just a chess piece to be used in the political arena. This article presents an overview of policies related to climate change and examines the response, both domestically and internationally, by organizations and the social work profession. It appears that U.S. social workers are lagging behind the rest of the world with respect to training and preparedness for addressing climate change and its effect even though social workers are uniquely situated to address this issue given the profession's emphasis on advocacy, social justice, and community organizing.

Educational programmes present ideal fora to confer 'environmental competencies' to future health system leaders, managers, practitioners and researchers. The aim of this review is to synthesise the literature on health-care competencies, education and training of relevance to issues of environmental sustainability and climate change in the health sector. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English language articles on environmental competencies in healthcare in the MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and ProQuest databases published from inception to April 2019. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to synthesise the findings and develop a typology of environmental competencies. Results: Of the 902 unique citations, we identified 23 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Environmental competencies that align with general management skills were most frequent (40%), followed by research skills (37%). Three competencies specific to the environment (22%) were identified: resource stewardship (n = 16), systems thinking (n = 14) and social and environmental justice (n = 7). The majority of work was identified in nursing, medicine and public health. Competencies were most commonly embedded in existing curricula or offered as new courses or workshops. Conclusion: Incorporating environmental competencies into education programmes will serve to raise awareness of, and advance the significance of, the health sector's impact on climate change and environmental sustainability. Our findings that environmental competencies align with previously validated health-care competencies support the perspective that these competencies represent essential knowledge and skills for the health-care workforce.","[Parker, Gillian; Berta, Whitney; Shea, Christine; Miller, Fiona] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, 155 Coll St,4th Floor, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada","Parker, G (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, 155 Coll St,4th Floor, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada.",gillian.elliott@mail.utoronto.ca,,"Elliott, Gillian/0000-0001-9884-9181",,,,38,3,3,3,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0017-8969,1748-8176,,HEALTH EDUC J,Health Educ.

It explores how regional concerns about Northern Gateway helped galvanize a movement led by regional First Nations, environmentalists, and settler communities, all of whom opposed Gateway as a means to protect regional ecosystems-and the local communities dependent on them-from extra-regional Gateway-backing elites. By articulating arguments against Northern Gateway with salient collective action frames concerning ecological sustainability, regional identity, Indigenous sovereignty, social justice, and democratic agency, this anti-Gateway discourse coalition helped contribute to the project's ultimate collapse in 2016. In this paper, we critically engage with Ernesto Laclau's theorization of Populism to analyse this movement as a form of regional ecological populism, explaining how a shift in spatial framing from the national to the regional enabled a particular populist narrative to emerge. Furthermore, we relate Laclau's framework to Martin Hajer's concept of discursive storylines and William Gamson's analysis of collective action frames to provide a grounded analysis of how coalitions articulate populist storylines designed to mobilize diverse movement constituents. To do so we conduct a frame analysis of communications materials produced by several prominent First Nations and environmental organizations publicly mobilizing against Northern Gateway, tracing how these groups articulated a common regional ecological populist storyline. Finally, we end with some thoughts about the possibilities and challenges for scaling up regional ecological populism in Canada.","[Neubauer, Robert; Gunster, Shane] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada","Neubauer, R (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",rneubaue@sfu.ca,,,Vanier CGS Doctoral Scholarship - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [770-2011-0097]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research CouncilSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [435-2014-1237],This research was funded by a Vanier CGS Doctoral Scholarship awarded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (award number 770-2011-0097) and a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council grant entitled Cultural Politics of Climate Change (grant number 435-2014-1237).,,62,2,2,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-900X,,FRONT COMMUN,Front.

Design/methodology/approach This study combines bibliometric and content analysis methods to review 2,347 publications from 15 core EdLAM journals published from 2007 to 2016. Findings The bibliometric analysis identified five EdLAM thematic strands: school leadership for enhancing students' academic achievement and teachers' effectiveness; leadership for educational change, accountability and promoting democratic values; leadership for social justice, equal education and narrowing achievement gaps; principal's instructional leadership for school improvement; and distributed leadership and its impact on organisational climate and teachers' attitudes and stress. The content analysis revealed that the EdLAM research from 2007 to 2016 further developed the following research areas: the dynamics between leaders and teachers in leadership work, the potential risks of distributed leadership and the EdLAM challenges brought by the New Public Management and neoliberalism. Originality/value This study depicts state-of-the-art EdLAM research. It confirms the combination of bibliometric and content analyses as a useful approach for large-scale review studies.

In the wake of recent flood disasters in the United States (US) and globally, more researchers are investigating social vulnerabilities as well as the role of cognition in explaining risk perceptions. This study analyzed how people in the US perceive the risk (i.e., likelihood and seriousness) of flooding via a layered analysis that considered several plausible and intertwined lines of inquiry from the risk perception literature. We surveyed 9250 individuals within nine major urban areas, including the largest city and one smaller city in each region. The National Flood Hazard Layer product provided data for deriving their potential exposure to flood hazards. The analyses tested and confirmed several hypotheses drawn from Social Vulnerability Theory and from Protective Motivation Theory: characteristics associated with social vulnerability (older, female, race/ethnic minorities, low income), previous experiences with and awareness of flood news, and potential exposure to flood hazard (local fraction of flood prone area) significantly increased risk perceptions of floods. Self-confidence in ability to cope with a future flood disaster lowered risk perceptions. This study is the first snapshot of flood risk perceptions nationwide in the US. It points to needs for more theoretically-driven research about flood risk perceptions and behaviors, flood risk communication within local communities, and more social and economic support for vulnerable populations.

To address this gap, we propose environmental justice (EJ) indicators as a proxy for social and economic considerations when siting biochar production facilities. Specifically, we develop a siting index for a biochar pyrolysis facility using low-cost, carbon-neutral solar energy. This siting index provides a framework for analyzing potential facility locations based on both technical and environmental and energy justice considerations. Results indicate that EJ analyses may influence the planning processes for industrial facility siting and that incorporating EJ into siting decisions would represent a commitment to environmental sustainability as well as the social and economic conditions of communities.","[Saxe, Jennie Perey] Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 302-831-2446,343A DuPont Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Boman, John H.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Sociol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Bondi, Mick; Righetti, Tara K.] Univ Wyoming, Coll Law, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Norton, Urszula] Univ Wyoming, Dept Plant Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Rony, Asif Hasan] Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem Engn, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Sajjadi, Baharak] Univ Mississippi, Dept Chem Engn, University, MS 38677 USA","Saxe, JP (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 302-831-2446,343A DuPont Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",jpsaxe@udel.edu,,"Saxe, Jennie/0000-0002-7282-5672; Norton, Urszula/0000-0001-6091-4339",National Science Foundation (NSF EPSCoR RII Grant)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA-1632899],The authors are grateful to the National Science Foundation (NSF EPSCoR RII Grant No. OIA-1632899) for financial support.,,73,2,2,1,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

To address these limitations, we examined disproportionate exposure to flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Greater Houston (Texas). Using primary survey data collected from 377 representative households before Harvey and spatial data on Harvey-induced inundation developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, we found that the areal extent of flooding around residents' home sites was distributed inequitably with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Hispanic, black and other racial/ethnic minority households experienced more extensive flooding than white households, and lower SES households faced more extensive flooding than higher SES households. Findings align with prior flood risk research in Greater Houston and provide cause for concern, as social inequities in flood exposure may have influenced social disparities in flood impacts and post-disaster needs. Since flood events in Greater Houston are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change, socially disparate impacts are likely to become an increasingly salient public policy issue. Thus, proactive approaches for reducing flood risks and ameliorating disparities should be implemented.","[Collins, Timothy W.; Flores, Aaron B.] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, 260 Cent Campus Dr,Rm 4625, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Grineski, Sara E.] Univ Utah, Dept Sociol, 380 S 1530 E,Rm 301, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Chakraborty, Jayajit] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 500 West Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Collins, TW (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Geog, 260 Cent Campus Dr,Rm 4625, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",tim.collins@geog.utah.edu,,"Flores, Aaron/0000-0003-0933-1386",US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1841654],"This research was funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF; grant CMMI-1841654).

Torn between social justice and status enhancement, the profession vacillated between advocating for social reform and seeking elite support. Ongoing contradictions between empowerment and expertise, social change and social control, and collaboration with and coercion of constituents reflect this tension. During the past 4 decades, neoliberalism, antiwelfare perspectives, and hyperpartisan politics transformed social work practice and its research and knowledge base. The 2016 election rocked the profession and produced significant changes for the people with whom we work and the nature of social work. New social movements, such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, and global action over climate change and gun violence have also posed new challenges. Social workers must now reexamine long-standing assumptions about practice and evidence; their relationship to power, place, and context; and their role in shaping the future of US society.","[Reisch, Michael] Univ Maryland, Sch Social Work, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Reisch, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Social Work, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,63,1,1,1,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0037-7961,1537-5404,,SOC SERV REV,Soc.

Resilience has emerged as a conceptual frame to drive both climate and energy policy in this transitional moment. For example, in the wake of major storms such as Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, policymakers have frequently called for greater resilience of the energy system and resilience of vulnerable communities impacted by the storms. This Article focuses on resilience at the system level. It argues that, in many cases, resilience of the energy system may actually reify structural inequality and exacerbate vulnerability. A hardening of existing energy infrastructure may also operate to harden existing social, economic, and environmental injustices that disproportionately burden the poor and people of color. Such situations call for new framings beyond resilience and transition toward liberation and transformation. This Article argues that, to facilitate the liberation of low-income communities and communities of color from the disproportionate impacts they face under the current energy system-and to foster a just transformation of the energy system-activists, policy-makers, and scholars engaged in the work of climate and energy justice must adopt a framework of anti-resilience: An anti-racist and anti-oppression policy approach focused on the greater social and economic inclusion of people of color and low-income communities in the renewable energy transition.","[Baker, Shalanda H.] Northeastern Univ, Law, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Baker, Shalanda H.] Northeastern Univ, Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Baker, SH (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Law, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Baker, SH (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,,,,,164,8,8,0,88,HARVARD LAW SCHOOL,CAMBRIDGE,"PUBLICATIONS CTR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",0017-8039,1943-5061,,HARVARD CIVIL RIGHTS,Harv.

Background Nursing has a long history of political activism in relation to social justice issues. Some nurses are environmental activists. Design Ethnography. Methods Focus groups and individual interviews were triangulated with additional observational data. The 40 participants (USA = 23, UK = 17) were nurses actively engaged with environmental/sustainability issues. Data collection was from March-October 2017. Data were analysed using discourse analysis. Results The trigger for nurses' environmental activism was a strong emotional response to recognizing risks to human health. Their activism results in an additional emotion burden above which they routinely experience in caring for patients. Many feel over-whelmed by the magnitude of the issues. Nurses in America feel more supported and empowered to be activists than UK nurses. Conclusion This study reveals for the first time that advocating for the environment is emotional labour, additional to the previously recognized emotional labour associated with caring for patients. Encouragement and support from others, particularly fellow nurses, helps nurse environmental activists continue to fight for the health of communities and the planet. Impact Outrage at threats to human health triggers nurses' environmental activism. Environmental activism creates an additional emotional burden above that routinely experienced in caring for patients. Nurses in America feel more supported and empowered to be activists than UK. Nurses whose practice embraces environmental activism need practical and emotional support from other nurses.","[Terry, Louise] London South Bank Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Care, Dept Adult Nursing, London, England; [Bowman, Karen] Univ Washington Bothell, Sch Nursing & Hlth Studies, Bothell, WA USA","Terry, L (corresponding author), London South Bank Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Care, Dept Adult Nursing, Law & Eth, 103 Borough Rd, London SE1 0AA, England.",terrylm@lsbu.ac.uk,,"Terry, Louise/0000-0002-8383-657X",London South Bank University,This study was funded by London South Bank University.,,65,1,1,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-2402,1365-2648,,J ADV NURS,J.

Policies on 'sustainable development' are likewise predicated upon efforts to assure future human prosperity. Our objective in this paper is to establish an alternative, post-anthropocentric perspective on environmental sustainability. Drawing on feminist materialist scholarship supplies an ontology to critique humanist approaches, and establishes the foundation for a posthuman sociology of environment, in which (post)humans are an integral but not privileged element. We consider the implications of this perspective for both sustainability policy and 'climate justice'. A posthuman ontology leads to the conclusion - perhaps surprisingly, given the anthropogenic roots of current climate change - that some unusual human capacities are now essential to assure environmental potential.","[Fox, Nick J.] Univ Huddersfield, Behav & Social Sci, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Alldred, Pam] Brunel Univ, Sch Clin Sci, London, England","Fox, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Behav & Social Sci, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.",n.j.fox@hud.ac.uk,,"Fox, Nick/0000-0003-2037-2664; Alldred, Pam/0000-0002-5077-7286",,,,83,8,8,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

To do so, it is crucial to present problems close to students, changing the focus of science teaching, from the acquisition of knowledge to its application. However, the problems that arise in classrooms are usually global, such as climate change or deforestation, and the suggested solutions do not involve behavioural changes. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a proposal for Early Childhood Education, focused on students' use of plastics and the consequences for the environment. The implementation is carried out in a 5-year-old classroom, collecting the written productions of the students. We consider students' ability to understand the process of plastic contamination and reflect on the impact of their excessive use. The results show that students come to identify the problem and recognize their role in it, considering, among others, the excess of plastic they use in their daily life, the route it takes from home to the ocean, and its consequences.","[Guevara Herrero, Irene; Bravo Torija, Beatriz; Perez Martin, Jose Manuel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Herrero, IG (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,"UNIV GRANADA, FAC CIENCIAS EDUCACION",GRANADA,"CAMPUS UNIV CARTUJA S-N, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN",2254-5883,,,REIDOCREA,ReiDoCrea,,2020,9,,,,,,192,211,,10.30827/Digibug.66366,,,20,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,TP5PW,WOS:000677652500009,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

The accelerating and deepening impacts of climate change will not be borne equally or fairly, with poor developing countries who have contributed little to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions bearing the brunt of global climate change. The lack of bargaining power in international negotiations by developing countries has enabled developed countries to determine not only the amount of their climate finance contributions, but to frame climate finance not as compensation for historical emissions, which would establish responsibility and imply liability, but as a gesture of goodwill rather than as an obligation. Developing countries are facing a bleak future if current GHG emission trends continue.

It is a social movement that seeks to avoid and raise awareness about the exploitation of, and cruelty towards, animals for human purposes and consumption practices. This paper provides a critical reflection on my experience of being vegan, that has raised some ethical questions for me about some of the unintended implications of veganism. This critically reflective process has empowered me to research my implicit assumptions surrounding veganism, and their connection to dominant discourses that serve to shape unequal power distributions within society. Specifically, this paper examines how veganism as a movement has become increasingly concerned with promoting environmental justice due to its intersection with animal rights, which may have unintended related colonising implications in which Indigenous people's rights are further oppressed. It highlights how veganism, particularly within the West, is interlocked with privilege and cultural capital. The intersections between food sovereignty and Indigenous rights are also discussed. An example of the ways this research can help shift the discussion around de-colonising the vegan movement is given in relation to the implications for social work practice; particularly the field of Green social work.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,1,SOCIAL ALTERNATIVES,MAROOCHYDORE DC,"UNIV SUNSHINE COAST, FAC ARTS & BUSINESS, MAROOCHYDORE DC, QLD 4556, AUSTRALIA",0155-0306,1836-6600,,SOC ALTERN,Soc.

Others find the term helpful in drawing attention to disastrous environmental change, inspiring a reinvigorated attention to the ontological unruliness of the world, to multiple temporal scales, and to intertwined social and natural histories. New forms of noticing can be linked to systems analytics, including capitalist world systems, structural comparisons of patchy landscapes, infrastructures and ecological models, emerging sociotechnical assemblages, and spirits.

These transformations go beyond technological fixes and require fundamental changes in cognitive, relational, structural and functional aspects of agricultural systems. However, research on agricultural transformations fails to engage deeply with underlying social aspects such as differing perceptions of sustainability, uncertainties and ambiguities, politics of knowledge, power imbalances and deficits in democracy. In this paper, we suggest that conflict is one manifestation of such underlying social aspects. We present an original conceptualization and analytical framework, wherein conflict is recognized as an important motor for redistribution of power and leverage for social learning that-if addressed through a conflict transformation process-could potentially create a step-change in agricultural transformation towards greater sustainability. Our analysis, building on an extensive literature review and empirical case studies from around the world, suggests a novel approach to guide future transdisciplinary research that can support agricultural transformations towards sustainability.","[Skrimizea, Eirini; Lecuyer, Lou; Vanbergen, Adam J.; Young, Juliette C.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, AgroSup Dijon, INRAE, Agroecol, Dijon, France; [Bunnefeld, Nils; Hodgson, Isla] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling, Scotland; [Butler, James R.

Yet, the growing body of literature on stream daylighting spreads over an array of seemingly disconnected disciplines and lacks consistency in the terminology and the definitions of the practice. Moreover, nearly all the literature review studies on stream daylighting (mostly produced since 2000) underscore, as their point of departure, the daylighting projects rather than a review of the literature's content per se. Therefore, this study reassesses the literature on stream daylighting with a particular focus on its role, as a nature-based solution, for climate change mitigation and adaptation and for socio-environmental justice. We combine the systematic literature review (an all-encompassing review of the available literature on stream daylighting) with the inductive content analysis (an in-depth analysis of this literature's nature). Accordingly, we investigate all the relevant English-language publications since the first peer reviewed article on stream daylighting was published in 1992 until the end of 2018 to analyze four themes: the disciplines and sub-disciplines of the literature; the terminologies and synonyms of stream daylighting; the definitions of stream daylighting; and the case studies tackled in the literature. We develop a method that combines a systematic review of the stream daylighting literature and inductive content analysis. The method provides insights on the stream daylighting's literature's disciplines, terminologies, synonyms and case studies. The method is adaptable particularly, to nascent areas of study where sources' numbers range between 100-200. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Compelling evidence has accumulated that those interactions should be viewed as a globally interconnected, complex adaptive system in which heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and innovation play formative roles. The long-term evolution of that system cannot be predicted but can be understood and partially guided through dynamic interventions. Research has identified six capacities necessary to support such interventions in guiding development pathways toward sustainability. These are capacities to (a) measure sustainable development, (b) promote equity, (c) adapt to shocks and surprises, (d) transform the system into more sustainable development pathways, (e) link knowledge with action, and (f) devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together in exercising the other capacities.","[Clark, William C.; Harley, Alicia G.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Clark, WC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",William_Clark@hks.harvard.edu; Alicia_Harley@hks.harvard.edu,,,"Italy's Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","This work was supported by a generous gift from Italy's Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea to the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard University.

Aiming to initiate a climate-centered dialogue, a hybrid team of scientists and artists collected local narratives within the Kerourien neighbourhood, in the city of Brest in Brittany, France. Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture. The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhood's 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment - thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that place-based climate service co-production for action may require questioning the nature of the services rendered, questioning the nature of place, and questioning what action entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice.","[Baztan, Juan; Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul; Zhu, Zhiwei] Univ Paris Saclay, CEARC, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France; [Jaffres, Lionel] Le Grain, F-29200 Brest, France; [Jorgensen, Bethany] Cornell Univ, Civ Ecol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Baztan, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CEARC, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France.",juan.baztan@uvsq.fr,,,FORMAS (SE); BELSPO (BE); BMBF (DE)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES); ANR (FR)French National Research Agency (ANR); European UnionEuropean Commission [690462],"Thanks to All the Kerourien inhabitants for their kindness.

Greater attention is therefore required to be given to the above mentioned areas for the future of tourism. Research limitations/implications - Greater responsibility and care is required to be undertaken by all stakeholders in tourism, including residents, business and tourists.

This article discusses ethnographic work on struggles over livelihoods and national park regulations, and examines collisions and collusions of indigenous shamanic ontologies, moral ecologies, and a hierarchical state symbolism of hunting, to tell very different storylines about languages of nature slipping into affinity with communicative orders of hierarchical purity and power distinctions. Protected areas for nature and wildlife are established in ethnically marked territories, perceived by elites as places of jangal, lacking in culture. Ethnographic research in the Langtang National Park reveals that no singular hegemonic order or ontology dominates but dialogues of power, knowledge, and relational possibility come into play. The aftermath of 2015s earthquakes notably occasioned appeals for social justice to bend the singularly proprietorial resource language of nature protection authorities.","[Campbell, Ben] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham, England","Campbell, B (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham, England.",ben.campbell@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,49,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0014-1844,1469-588X,,ETHNOS,Ethnos,JAN 1,2020,85,1,,,SI,,79,99,,10.1080/00141844.2019.1574854,,,21,Anthropology,Anthropology,OM4ZM,WOS:000586034900005,,Green Accepted,,,2021-08-07,

Existing approaches such as linking hydrological models to economic loss models may be highly inequitable between areas of different socio-economic vulnerability. To our knowledge, no one has tried to adapt the more advanced known heat risk theory by first informing flood risk with the socio-economic vulnerability, and then investigating the sensitivity of risk reduction policies to that flood risk. In this article, we demonstrate two methods to combine water hazard data with a derived water vulnerability index to characterize water risk. We then compare the costs of two potential government policies: buyout of the home versus funding for foundation elevation. We use the case study area of Pittsburgh, PA, which faces severe precipitation and riverine flooding hazards. We find that while small differences in characterizing flood risk can result in large differences between flood risk maps, the cost of the flood risk reduction policy is not sensitive to the method of representing the socio-economic vulnerability. This suggests that while validation of flood risk incorporating socioeconomic data is needed, for some policies, policymakers can prioritize environmental justice with little to no additional cost.","[Klima, K.; Kong, W.; Prosdocimi, D.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [El Gammal, L.] Opus One Solut, Toronto, ON M5C 1P1, Canada","Klima, K (corresponding author), RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA.",kklima@rand.org; lobna@gmail.com; dkong@rand.org; dprosdoc@rand.org,,"Kong, Weilong/0000-0001-7408-3329; Klima, Kelly/0000-0003-4070-4961",NSF Grant for From Future Learning to Current Action: Long-Term Sequential Infrastructure Planning Under Uncertain Climate Change [1663479],This work was supported by the NSF Grant for From Future Learning to Current Action: Long-Term Sequential Infrastructure Planning Under Uncertain Climate Change (Award number 1663479).

In this collection, we train our eyes on these refashionings, asking how late industrial systems might be put to life-affirming work.

Can states innovate, reach further, and ignite near-universal consumer demand for clean energy and achieve social justice goals through equitable community solar? For the last decade, the goal of mitigating climate change primarily drove the transition to renewable energy in states and countries that took the climate change crisis seriously. But there is even greater promise. The shift to renewable energy holds the transformative potential for broader social benefits, such as wealth-building opportunities, good jobs, health improvements, energy bill savings, and resilience in the face of power outages. Manifesting this potential requires intentional policy. Unfortunately, even in California, a state determined to lead the transition to renewable energy, the implementation of climate action is poised for inequitable disparities. Although advocates saw community solar-cooperatively generating solar energy-as an avenue for all communities to benefit from the energy transition, the state poorly designed its first community solar policy, and the program has been a failure. California is now embarking on a significantly smaller second attempt at community solar targeted at serving disadvantaged communities: the Community Solar Green Tariff.

Sociology is also poised to make important contributions to the study of climate justice across multiple lines of stratification, including race, class, gender, indigenous identity, sexuality and queerness, and disability, and to articulate the effects of climate change on our relationship to nonhuman species.

To historically situate this relationship, in this article I examine thirty papal encyclical letters and three other salient documents issued by six Popes, spanning a period between publication of Rachel Carson's 1962 Silent Spring (a common starting-point for modern environmentalism) and Pope Francis' 2015 Laudato si' ['Praise Be to You']: On Care for our Common Home encyclical on climate change. Encyclicals were coded for changes in Catholic doctrine using a typology developed by sociologists of religion: from a 'Stewardship Ethic' rooted in individual sin, to an 'Eco-Justice' ethic, which bridges concern for the environment with concern for the poor, and finally, to an ethic of 'Creation Spirituality', which views humans and nature as inseparable. This analysis offered evidence of significant doctrinal shifts in Catholic social teaching toward a distinctively 'greener' reading of the tradition. Research on the religion-environment connection that focuses on describing and interpreting change over time offers robust means by which to assess whether, how, and to what extent religious organizations and their adherents engage with environmental issues.","[Szrot, Lukas] Bemidji State Univ, Dept Sociol, 1500 Birchmt Dr NE 23, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA","Szrot, L (corresponding author), Bemidji State Univ, Dept Sociol, 1500 Birchmt Dr NE 23, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA.",Lukas.Szrot@bemidjistate.edu,,,,,,95,0,0,2,2,EQUINOX PUBLISHING LTD,SHEFFIELD,"415, THE WORKSTATION, 15 PATERNOSTER ROW, SHEFFIELD, S1 2BX, ENGLAND",1749-4907,1749-4915,,J STUD RELIG NAT CUL,J.

This article aims to provide an overview of how the current sociopolitical context threatens the public health of refugee and immigrant communities and to describe the role of psychologists in advocating for social justice and responding to this urgent public health need through interprofessional collaboration and translation of scientific knowledge into multilevel intervention development. The case study of the You're Not Alone (YNA) initiative describes swiftly mobilized advocacy efforts (e.g., press conference, webinars, resources development and dissemination) and participatory development and roll-out of community capacity-building trainings to address the needs of refugee/immigrant children and families. Trainings aimed to raise awareness of the refugee/immigrant experience and to equip refugee/immigrant community members and providers across a variety of public sectors to implement culturally responsive and trauma-informed strategies to promote resilience, respond to distress, and prevent mental health crises. Between March 2017 and June 2018, a total of 1,642 individuals attended 48 training events. The role of psychologists in future policy and advocacy efforts to promote mental health among refugee/immigrant families is discussed as well as implications for how other marginalized communities affected by the current sociopolitical climate might benefit from broadening the scope of this public health response.","[Ford-Paz, Rebecca E.; Coyne, Claire A.; Rivera, Claudio; Guo, Sisi; Cicchetti, Colleen] Lurie Childrens Hosp, Ctr Childhood Resilience, Pritzker Dept Psychiat & Behav Hlth, 225 East Chicago Ave,Box 10B, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Ford-Paz, Rebecca E.; Coyne, Claire A.; Rivera, Claudio; St Jean, Nicole; Cicchetti, Colleen] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Santiago, Catherine DeCarlo] Loyola Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL USA; [Rusch, Dana] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Hilado, Aimee] NE Illinois Univ, Dept Social Work, Chicago, IL USA; [Coyne, Claire A.] Lurie Childrens Potocsnak Family Div Adolescent &, Chicago, IL USA; [Guo, Sisi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Div Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Ford-Paz, RE (corresponding author), Lurie Childrens Hosp, Ctr Childhood Resilience, Pritzker Dept Psychiat & Behav Hlth, 225 East Chicago Ave,Box 10B, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",rfordpaz@luriechildrens.org,,"Hilado, Aimee/0000-0002-3449-7196; Santiago, Catherine DeCarlo/0000-0001-9276-7871","Lloyd A.

This is especially true of the most prominent and paradigm example of climate engineering, the spraying of sulfate particles into the stratosphere in order to block incoming sunlight and so limit global warming (hereafter, 'stratospheric sulfate injection' (SSI)). Geoengineering ethics, like geoengineering science, is still in its early, exploratory days. This chapter offers an introductory overview of the emerging discussion and some of the challenges moving forward, taking SSI as its key example. It identifies a range of values relevant to geoengineering, exposes some misleading early framings, argues that questions of justification and context are both important, and summarizes the Tollgate principles for geoengineering governance. One theme is that despite the initial agreement on the centrality of ethics, in practice there are profound risks that ethical considerations will be marginalized, both in the short-term as research is developed, and in the longer-run, in any deployment.","[Gardiner, Stephen M.] Univ Washington, Dept Philosophy, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gardiner, Stephen M.] Univ Washington, Program Eth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Gardiner, SM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Philosophy, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Gardiner, SM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Program Eth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",smgard@uw.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1549983],"Earlier versions were presented to the National Research Council's Committee on Geoengineering (September 2013) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (February 2015).

Such a perspective builds on the concept of a climate-just city, which prioritizes the needs of those most vulnerable to climate change. This study focuses on Bangkok, a city not only highly vulnerable to climate change, but a city with one of the highest carbon emissions per capita. The chapter highlights instances of urban climate injustice by presenting three case studies: Bangkok's public transportation sector, the state's response to the 2011 floods, and coastal erosion in southern Bangkok. The cases show that the city's governance of climate change has unjustly benefited the upper echelon of society, while low-income communities have been adversely affected.","[Marks, Danny] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Environm Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Marks, D (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Environm Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,68,0,0,0,0,AMSTERDAM UNIV PRESS,AMSTERDAM 1071,"PRINSENGRACHI 747-51, AMSTERDAM 1071, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-485-4491-2; 978-94-637-2881-2,ASIAN CIT,,,2020,11,,,,,,155,182,,10.5117/9789463728812_CH07,10.5117/9789463728812,,28,Urban Studies,Urban Studies,BP3PC,WOS:000548484300007,,,,,2021-08-07,

Although these communities are often portrayed as the faces of climate change, their voices are rarely heard in climate-related decision-making. This article examines how Indigenous communities in the Canadian Arctic can ensure their inclusion in climate change related governance. In particular, this article analyzes whether the Crown owes a duty to consult and accommodate to Indigenous communities in the Arctic, whose rights recognized and protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 are adversely affected by the impacts of climate change, when contemplating action that would increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus further contribute to global climate change. This article concludes that the duty to consult and accommodate could likely be triggered in this context, though there are certainly obstacles. Triggering the duty to consult and accommodate in the context of climate change is largely dependent on identifying Crown conduct. The author puts forward three potential ways to satisfy the Crown conduct prong of the Haida Nation test, namely: (i) a single contemplated action/decision that will increase GHG emissions; (ii) a constellation of decisions/actions that will increase GHG emissions and; (iii) regulations or executive policies that will increase GHG emissions. In sum, as climate litigation has emerged around the world, and recently in Canada, this article seeks to engage in a larger discussion as to whether Canadian law has the capacity to advance climate justice.",,,,,,,,,87,0,0,1,1,"MCGILL UNIV, FAC LAW",MONTREAL,"CHANCELLOR DAY HALL, 3644 PEEL ST, MONTREAL, QC H3A 1W9, CANADA",1712-9664,,,MCGILL INT J SUSTAIN,McGill Int.

This opens up an integrated view, which takes into account both societal and individual aspects of the perception and evaluation of environmental justice. In this sense, notions of environmental justice(s) are seen as the result of discursive processes, historical contexts and a social localization and standardization that is shaped by both cognitive evaluation processes and emotions. Additionally, environmental justice in participation processes is considered in the context of environmental and sustainability policy and its implementation, first summarising the points of criticism of participation processes and then discussing environmental justice as an aspect of participation practice. From this, some key points for a more justice-sensitive design of participation processes in the context of environmental and sustainability policies and programmes (e.g. adaptation to climate change, urban planning, energy system transformation) are derived. This interdisciplinary analysis shows that there is not 'one' environmental justice, but a multitude of ideas and evaluations based on different concepts and perceptions.","[Baasch, Stefanie] Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Baasch, S (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Sustainabil Res Ctr Artec, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",stefanie.baasch@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,70,1,1,0,2,GESELLSCHAFT ERDKUNDE BERLIN,BERLIN,"ARNO-HOLZ-STR 14, BERLIN, 12165, GERMANY",0013-9998,,,ERDE,ERDE,,2020,151,2-3,,,,,77,89,,10.12854/erde-2020-516,,,13,"Geography; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geography; Physical Geography; Geology,NH1TZ,WOS:000564460800003,,,,,2021-08-07,

Since the end of the 20th century, the traditional hard flood protection measures have been increasingly complemented with spatial flood risk reduction measures. These measures, though in the public interest and as such, benefitting many people, almost inevitably affect landowners adversely. In other words, spatial flood risk reduction measures affect private land. The impact may extend from mere decreases in property values as a result of changes to zoning plans and to obligations to tolerate certain acts related to the construction or maintenance of water defence structures. Most of the time, implementation of spatial flood risk reduction measures thus discriminates between landowners, as some profit from better protection but others are affected negatively by the measures. Spatial flood risk reduction measures thus raise issues of social justice. Compensation plays a crucial role in flood risk management to mitigate the impact on land. How and in which cases this compensation is paid differs from country to country. Some national jurisdictions compensate for loss as a result of lawful administrative acts if and to the extent that it is considered unreasonable for this loss to be the full responsibility of the affected party. In this paper, we compare two different legal compensation frameworks in two European countries: Austria and the Netherlands. Based on a comparative analysis, we discuss how these different compensation schemes affect social justice, both in terms of substantive distributions but also in terms of procedural justice.","[Thaler, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Doorn, Neelke] Delft Univ Thchnol, Dept Technol Policy & Management Values, Technol & Innovat, Bldg 31,Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Hartmann, Thomas] Wageningen Univ & Res, Land Use Planning Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Thaler, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",thomas.thaler@boku.ac.at; N.Doorn@tudelft.nl; thomas.hartmann@wur.nl,"Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014","Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; Austrian Climate Research Program [B769942]; Dutch National Research Council NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [VI.Vidi.195.119],Thomas Thaler received financial support from the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund and his work was carried out within the Austrian Climate Research Program (funding no.

Two separate studies were conducted on the same protests. In Study 1, we conducted a quantitative study (N = 259), to examine the role of socio-demographics and socio-psychological predictors in predicting the actual protest. Participants were demonstrators (N = 158), as well as non-demonstrators (N = 101). Results indicated that moral motivation and identification as an environmentalist were the key variables in explaining actual protest. In Study 2, we conducted a framing analysis of the written manifestos (N = 2), to identify the core framing tasks which were used to inspire and legitimize the protests. The framing analysis suggests that the problems and paths for action were described by appealing to the interlinkage between the global and local dimensions of climate change, and that arguments of severity and urgency of the problem were the most salient. The implications of this research are discussed in relation to possible pathways for a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons why people engage in collective action in climate change related issues, and how these motives may relate to how social movements mobilize people for action.","[Fernandes-Jesus, Maria; Lima, Maria Luisa] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Cis IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Sabucedo, Jose-Manuel] Univ Santiago Compostela, Dept Social Psychol Basic Psychol & Methodol, Santiago Of Compostela, Spain","Fernandes-Jesus, M (corresponding author), Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Cis IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",maria.jesus@iscte-iul.pt,"Fernandes-Jesus, Maria/AAA-2387-2019; Sabucedo, Jose-Manuel/H-7216-2015; Lima, M Luisa/E-5173-2010","Sabucedo, Jose-Manuel/0000-0002-3002-851X; Lima, M Luisa/0000-0003-1171-2962","Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [SFRH/BPD/103371/2014]; Center for Psychological Research and Social Intervention (Cis-IUL, Instituto Universitario de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL)) - Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [UID/PSI/03125/2013]","This work was supported by a postdoctoral research fellowship [grant number SFRH/BPD/103371/2014] and by funds of the Center for Psychological Research and Social Intervention (Cis-IUL, Instituto Universitario de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL) -Ref.

The region was affected by an extreme hydrological and climatological event, which was combined with the unsustainable management of water resources. The paper addresses, initially, the dynamics of water governance in the region, and the main aspects related to water availability and climate dependence that caused the water crisis. Then, we present an analysis of the process that led to the water crisis and its main developments, which is based on the follow-up of the different moments of the crisis and dialogues with its relevant stakeholders. The results indicate the relevance of emphasizing issues on matters such as the lack of transparency and highlight the role of societal initiatives. We conclude the paper with a proposition to discuss governance processes that can contribute to the development of more effective initiatives in order to reduce the impact of this visible change in water regimes, strengthen transparent management, and promote a more democratic interaction between social actors and the government.","[Campello Torres, Pedro Henrique; Cortes, Pedro Luiz; Jacobi, Pedro Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energia & Ambiente IEE, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Cortes, Pedro Luiz] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Comunicacao & Artes ECA, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Torres, PHC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energia & Ambiente IEE, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",pedrotorres@usp.br,"Torres, Pedro Henrique Campello/AAS-7895-2021","Torres, Pedro Henrique Campello/0000-0002-0468-4329","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2018/06685-9, 2019/05644-0, 2015/03804-9]","The Sao Paulo Research Foundation supported this study (FAPESP), with the Process 2018/06685-9 and 2019/05644-0, which is part of the Thematic Project MacroAmb Environmental Governance in Sao Paulo Macrometropolis in a climate variability context, 2015/03804-9.

Parliament and Council and seeks to analyse what the outcome of this case reveals about barriers to climate litigation, and public interest environmental suits in general, in the EU legal order. In response to this application for annulment under art. 263 TFEU, the Court held that the far-reaching nature of the effects of climate change exclude that they may give rise to an 'individual concern' such that neither individuals nor environmental NGOs have standing to challenge whether EU climate legislation sufficiently protects fundamental rights threatened by climate change. This outcome renews questions about whether the EU legal order provides adequate and effective access to justice in environmental matters, and what reforms may be needed to bring the EU into compliance with its duty to provide effective access to justice in accordance with art. 9 of the 1998 Aarhus Convention. Examining these issues and placing this case within the climate justice movement, this work considers possible reforms to bring the EU into compliance with the Aarhus Convention, and what the outcome in Carvalho and others may mean for future climate litigation before EU courts.","[Harris, Morgan Eleanor] Libera Univ Maria Ss Assunta LUMSA, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza Econ Polit & Lingue M, Via Marcantonio Colonna 19, I-00192 Rome, Italy","Harris, ME (corresponding author), Libera Univ Maria Ss Assunta LUMSA, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza Econ Polit & Lingue M, Via Marcantonio Colonna 19, I-00192 Rome, Italy.",m.harris@lumsa.it,,"Harris, Morgan/0000-0003-0047-791X",,,,27,0,0,1,2,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1971-7105,1972-5485,,DIRITTI UMANI DIRITT,Diritti Umani Diritto Int.,JAN-APR,2020,14,1,,,,,175,193,,10.12829/96813,,,19,International Relations; Law,International Relations; Government & Law,LR9VW,WOS:000536043700009,,,,,2021-08-07,

A novel typology of businesses' human rights duties ('duty' is considered synonymous with 'responsibility' here) is proposed. It claims that duties are both forward- and backward-looking. Cases of human rights litigation seeking remedy for climate-related harms are backward-looking, and duties should be determined on the basis of proportion of historical emissions, culpable knowledge and counter-acts to abate climate harms. Businesses' forward-looking duties, however, depend on their power, privilege, interest and collective abilities. The typology is then assessed against the background of recent legal principles and instruments. It is concluded that moral duties of business reach beyond mere respect for human rights and national jurisdictions in the context of climate change.","[Toft, Kristian Hoyer] Aalborg Univ, Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Aalborg, Denmark; [Toft, Kristian Hoyer] Aalborg Univ, Dept Learning & Culture, Ctr Appl Philosophy, Aalborg, Denmark","Toft, KH (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Aalborg, Denmark.; Toft, KH (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Learning & Culture, Ctr Appl Philosophy, Aalborg, Denmark.",khto.ioa@cbs.dk,,"Toft, Kristian Hoyer/0000-0002-9628-1606", [214681669],"The author is a member of the research project `Ethics and Energy', which has obtained funding from The Independent Research Fund Denmark -Humanities from 2014-2019 (grant number: 214681669).

To further expand on women's leadership role, I look into a deep Oceanic understanding of women and the environment, showing that Indigenous stories across Micronesia esteem the environment as sacred and maternal. Drawing on Indigenous stories of creation, I argue that Micronesian women historically held powerful status and prestige in their societies and that understanding maternal responsibility can be empowering and can advance gender equality, community resilience, and women's leadership in the contemporary Pacific.","[Kim, Myjolynne Marie] Coral Bell Sch Asia Pacific Affairs, Dept Pacific Affairs, Pacific Hist, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Kim, MM (corresponding author), Coral Bell Sch Asia Pacific Affairs, Dept Pacific Affairs, Pacific Hist, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,32,2,2,1,2,UNIV HAWAII PRESS,HONOLULU,"2840 KOLOWALU ST, HONOLULU, HI 96822 USA",1043-898X,1527-9464,,CONTEMP PACIFIC,Contemp.

J,[Anonymous],,,,[Anonymous],,,"General Practice and the Community: Research on health service, quality improvements and training. Selected abstracts from the EGPRN Meeting in Vigo, Spain, 17-20 October 2019 Abstracts",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic. Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do. Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care. Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge. Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation. Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services. Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care. Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work. Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all. Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions. Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids. What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory. Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction. Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia. Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); ; ",,,,"Campos, Caroline/AAT-5847-2021",,,,,0,2,2,191,2013,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1381-4788,1751-1402,,EUR J GEN PRACT,Eur.

To understand these aspects of climate change mitigation more broadly, this research uses a case study of the U.S. transition to energy efficient lighting. The results show that even though using efficient bulbs is commonly portrayed as easy, it can involve six phases of additional labor. The case of CFLs indicates that home climate practices beyond light bulbs can add up to significant work, particularly when they require the navigation of toxic or complex shifts in materiality, specialized knowledge, and uncertainties. Because home climate practices like using CFLs are the kind of work traditionally performed by women, they can expand the gender climate gap and are often devalued in inequitable ways. This research illuminates the importance of making the labor and gendering of environmental practices visible.","[Thoyre, Autumn] San Francisco State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs & Civ Engagement, Environm Studies Program, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA","Thoyre, A (corresponding author), 1600 Holloway Ave,HSS Bldg,Room 261, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",athoyre@sfsu.edu,"Thoyre, Autumn/AAQ-5996-2021","Thoyre, Autumn/0000-0001-6950-2912",,,,129,1,1,2,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-5395,,,WOMEN STUD INT FORUM,Women Stud.

Social work entities around the world are increasingly highlighting professional responsibilities for addressing the global climate crisis. Often, social workers experience vicarious trauma from work with those immediately affected. Working within the context of the global climate crisis brings further risk. Social workers may be personally affected, or experiencing their own challenges, such as climate anxiety and eco-grief. Thus, radical self-care is a dire need as social workers promote sustainable communities and environments and seek ecological justice for all. This article discusses the health and mental health impacts of the compounding factors of the climate crisis, modern technology, and current political contexts. Activism for change and ecotherapeutic strategies are presented as radical self-care for social workers, in both academic and practice-based settings. These strategies are essential for recognizing, legitimizing, and addressing the need for radical self-care practices in the global climate crisis.","[Powers, Meredith C.

Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between redlining, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 degrees C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6 degrees C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.","[Hoffman, Jeremy S.; Pendleton, Nicholas] Sci Museum Virginia, Richmond, VA 23220 USA; [Hoffman, Jeremy S.; Pendleton, Nicholas] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Richmond, VA 23220 USA; [Shandas, Vivek] Portland State Univ, Nohad A Toulan Sch Urban Studies & Planning, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Hoffman, JS (corresponding author), Sci Museum Virginia, Richmond, VA 23220 USA.; Hoffman, JS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Richmond, VA 23220 USA.",pendletonnv@mymail.vcu.edu; vshandas@pdx.edu; pendletonnv@mymail.vcu.edu,,"Hoffman, Jeremy/0000-0001-7542-1000",NOAA Climate Program OfficeNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; U.S. Forest Service's National Urban and Community Forestry Challenge Grants Program [17-DG-11132544-014],"J.S.H. thanks the NOAA Office of Education Environmental Literacy Program, the Virginia Academy of Science, Groundwork RVA, Virginia Commonwealth University SustainLab, University of Richmond Spatial Analysis and Digital Scholarship Labs, and the City of Richmond Sustainability Office.

The Australian continent is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; however, effective national political responses appear to be compromised at every turn. Concerned groups and individuals are unsurprisingly seeking environmental justice in courts and tribunals, and litigation has challenged some of the largest coal developments in Australia. This article examines challenges in the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland jurisdictions by means of merits review and judicial review against coal mining project proposals in order to evaluate the approaches taken by tribunals and courts to the environmental assessment of coal projects. The recent decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court in Gloucester Resources Ltd v Minister for Planning has set rigorous new standards for assessment and approval processes with respect to coal projects. To this point decision-makers have taken conservative views of their powers to go beyond the immediate objective of the mining tenure or authorisation being sought, and have accepted the market substitution argument that if we do not mine the coal then someone, somewhere will and we will be no better off. On the other side, some courts have offered leadership in the development of progressive methodologies, such as a broader public interest test that embraces climate change issues, of which the Gloucester decision has been the high point.","[McGinness, Victoria] Bradley Allen Love, Environm & Planning Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Raff, Murray] Univ Canberra, Canberra Law Sch, Law, Environm & Planning Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia","McGinness, V (corresponding author), Bradley Allen Love, Environm & Planning Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,"Raff, Murray/0000-0002-8887-6394",,,,98,3,3,0,4,LAWBOOK CO LTD,PYRMONT,"LEVEL 6, 19 HARRIS ST, PYRMONT, NSW 2009, AUSTRALIA",0813-300X,,,ENVIRON PLAN LAW J,Environ.

As one expression of unity among the fellowship, the WCC embarked in 2013 on a Pilgrimage of Justice and Peace to work, pray, and walk together for life-affirming economies, climate change, nonviolent peace building, and reconciliation and human dignity. Champions of these issues exist within the ecumenical movement. Yet one also finds that champions of one theme are pushing back on another theme. Sometimes it is due to diversity of contexts and biblical and theological interpretations. At other times it is due to unconscious bias about the holistic nature of God's mission of justice for all God's people and creation. This paper grapples with this question: Why are people who are so alive to economic and ecological injustice sometimes blind to racial and gender injustice? To answer this, I explore the existence of conscious and unconscious bias despite the many powerful ecumenical statements that have been issued on racial justice.","[Reddie, Anthony G.] Regents Pk Coll, Oxford Ctr Relig & Culture, Oxford, England; [Reddie, Anthony G.] Univ South Africa, Theol Eth, Pretoria, South Africa","Reddie, AG (corresponding author), Regents Pk Coll, Oxford Ctr Relig & Culture, Oxford, England.; Reddie, AG (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Theol Eth, Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,44,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0796,1758-6623,,ECUMENICAL REV,Ecumen.

While ambitious targets and the transformations they inspire should be celebrated, it is nevertheless increasingly important to understand how renewable energy policies and discourses are being mobilized in the rollout of controversial energy technologies such as waste incineration. This paper engages analytical lenses from environmental justice scholarship on discourse, scale, and waste siting controversies to contribute to the emerging literature on the competing ways that actors frame controversial energy technologies. Specifically, drawing on case study research conducted in Austria from 2013 to 2015, it asks in what contexts, and by whom, are discourses of renewability enrolled in relation to waste-to-energy planning and management? Findings demonstrate the divergent ways in which Austrian and European Union policy elites and local residents frame waste incineration vis-a-vis its renewability. Ultimately, the article argues that framing discrepancies between policy elites and local residents are a reflection of procedural injustice.","[Behrsin, Ingrid] Univ Calif Davis, Publ Scholarship & Engagement, 181 Hunt Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Behrsin, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Publ Scholarship & Engagement, 181 Hunt Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",iabehrsin@ucdavis.edu,,,Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research; Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation; EU Center of Excellence; University of California Institute for Global Conflict and Cooperation; UC Davis Center for Regional Change; UC Davis Institute for Social Sciences; UC Davis Geography Graduate Group; UC Davis College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences; UC Davis Office of Graduate Studies,"I thank Jennifer Sedell, Nari Senanayake, Chris Benner, Ryan Galt, and Vanesa Castan Broto for their feedback on this article during various stages of its development.

This article provides an exploratory statistical analysis of three adaptation measures (shoreline armoring, property acquisitions, and beach nourishment) and their deployment with respect to metrics of risk exposure, socioeconomic markers, and critical infrastructure in North Carolina (U.S.). This exploratory analysis evaluates two propositions. First, adaptation measures are deployed relative to specific metrics of risk. Second, adaptation choice disproportionately correlates with socioeconomic attributes. The findings support both propositions and reveal that shoreline armoring correlates with higher home values, household incomes, and population density and low racial diversity. Property acquisitions are found to correlate with low home values, household incomes, and population density and high racial diversity. Furthermore, adaptation measures are interconnected. Acquisitions are more likely to occur in areas with low levels of armoring. Beach nourishment occurs exclusively in areas with shoreline armoring. The results find no correlation of adaptation deployment with critical infrastructure. This article provides the foundation for future research into how adaptation decisions are made and trade-offs among adaptation actions considered, whether decisions adequately protect critical infrastructure, and how deployment patterns affect social equity.","[Siders, A.

Using a GIS-based method, this study analyses the accessibility of Craiova residents to urban green spaces, identifying the areas with reduced green spaces and making recommendations for the improvement of the green areas available to residents. The number and location of the parks in the city are correlated with the population density within residential areas in order to analyse the accessibility to green areas based on both walking and driving distance between the access points of the green spaces and the residential areas. Data indicate an unevenly distribution of parks and access to green areas.","[Vilcea, Cristiana; Sosea, Cristina] Univ Craiova, Dept Geog, Craiova, Romania","Sosea, C (corresponding author), Univ Craiova, Dept Geog, Fac Sci, AI Cuza St 13, Craiova 200585, Romania.",cristinavmara@yahoo.com,"Șoșea, Cristina/AAI-8885-2021; Vilcea, Cristiana/AAJ-7422-2020",,,,,85,1,1,10,21,ROYAL DANISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOC,COPENHAGEN K,"OSTER VOLDGADE 10, COPENHAGEN K, DK 1350, DENMARK",0016-7223,1903-2471,,GEOGR TIDSSKR-DEN,Geogr.

Hyper-localization of climate change, accomplished by leading a small-scale community-based participatory research campaign (also known as citizen science) to assess the City of Richmond's urban heat island effect, improved audience literacy and recall of adaptation and resilience solutions. When further nested within curriculum aligned with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Steps to Resilience Framework, hyper-localization produced additional learning and behavioral outcomes that bridged the gap from literacy to action.

The COVID-19 pandemic threatened to eclipse the longer term crisis of global climate change. Australia's Black Summer of unprecedented bushfires in 2019-20 and Vanuatu's experience of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April 2020 were both signs of the increasing severity of 'natural' disasters due to anthropogenic climate change. Combining personal and political reflections on these two disasters, this essay analyses how the discourse of 'resilience' can deflect blame from the ultimate causes of climate change in increased greenhouse gas emissions and from those countries and corporations who are primarily responsible for the climate crisis. In both Australia and Vanuatu, it interrogates where resilience is located: in government and corporate systems of disaster preparedness and infrastructure and/or the communities and people who are suffering disasters of increasing severity and frequency. Per capita, Australia is one of the most polluting countries in the world and its current retrograde policies on climate change and energy perpetuate both climate crisis and injustice, whereby those in the Pacific who contribute the least to climate change suffer the most. Global inequalities are both cause and consequence of climate change. Fighting climate change must entail fighting against inequalities to achieve climate justice.","[Jolly, Margaret] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Coombs Bldg 9,Room 3-271,Fellows Rd, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Jolly, M (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Coombs Bldg 9,Room 3-271,Fellows Rd, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",margaret.jolly@anu.edu.au,,,,,,9,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1470-2541,1751-665X,,SCOT GEOGR J,Scott.

A critical examination of climate justice framings in Pakistani climate policymaking,CLIMATE POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate justice; polycentric governance; international governance; framings; Pakistan,GOVERNANCE; ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; DISCOURSE; NGOS,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which the existence of a polycentric climate governance regime in Pakistan has enabled diverse framings of climate justice to emerge and be operationalized within policymaking. A two-part analysis is conducted through systematic coding and textual analysis of interview transcripts and policy documents. Firstly, an analysis based on climate justice framings reveals that, whilst national governmental actors predominantly adopt an international framing of climate justice, non-state actors have increasingly adopted vulnerability, human rights and transformational framings of justice, thereby supporting the theory that polycentricity is widening the space for voicing diverse framings. Secondly, a polycentric governance-based analysis reveals that several institutional barriers limit the ability of non-state actors to operationalize these framings, particularly capacity and resource constraints, limits of scale and scope, changing legislation and the unequivocal power held by the state. Hence, Pakistan's overarching climate change strategy prioritizes justice between countries, while obscuring domestic inequalities, poverty and vulnerability, which are only addressed by non-state actors through isolated activities rather than in a coordinated manner within national policy. This finding suggests that polycentric governance can diversify climate discourse, but also that the intergovernmental climate regime may reinforce the nation state's international framings of justice at the expense of domestic justice concerns. Key policy insights Non-state actors within the polycentric climate governance regime in Pakistan are increasingly adopting framings of climate justice beyond those of the nation state, thereby bringing attention to issues of domestic poverty, inequality and vulnerability. Differences in power between state and non-state actors limit the extent to which different justice issues can be addressed through nationally and internationally-led climate policy. There are limitations to the ability of national-level polycentric climate governance regimes, when embedded in intergovernmental negotiations, to engage in redistributing power and advocating for different framings and dimensions of justice being raised by local actors.","[Shawoo, Zoha; McDermott, C.

Dangerous gaps lie between what is required to reach the 1.5 degrees C objective, what governments have pledged and what is happening in reality. Here, we develop 'climate policy gap' graphics for Portugal, Spain and Morocco to help reveal this divide and quantify the under-reaction between diagnosis and action, through layers of political intended and unintended miscommunication, insufficient action and the power of the fossil fuels industries. The climate policy gaps for the three nations reveal overshoots on even the most ambitious levels of emissions reductions pledged when compared with trajectories compatible with 1.5 degrees C or even 2 degrees C limits. This research suggests that there is a built-in feature of under-reaction in climate policy, which staves off any emission pathways compatible with stopping a temperature rise above 1.5 degrees C by 2100. It shows that the climate policy gap is a political and methodological tool that reveals systemic shortcomings of government climate action. Its visibility identifies benchmarks and sectors that should be activated to close these gaps in response to the growing popular demands for climate justice.","[Camargo, Joao; Schmidt, Luisa] Univ Lisbon, Inst Ciencias Sociais, Av Prof Anibal de Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal; [Barcena, Inaki] Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Comunicac, Bilbao, Spain; [Soares, Pedro M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Inst D Luiz, Lisbon, Portugal; [Andaluz, Javier] Dept Cambio Climat Ecologistas Acc, Madrid, Spain","Camargo, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Ciencias Sociais, Av Prof Anibal de Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.camargo.342@gmail.com; inaki.barcena@ehu.es; pmsoares@fc.ul.pt; mlschmidt@ics.ulisboa.pt; clima@ecologistasenaccion.org,"Soares, Pedro MM/K-6239-2012; Schmidt, Luisa/L-3368-2014","Soares, Pedro MM/0000-0002-9155-5874; Schmidt, Luisa/0000-0002-7449-8636; Camargo Ribeiro Marques dos Santos, Joao/0000-0003-3100-7478",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (MCTES)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PD/BD/114049/2015],This work was supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (MCTES) under Grant PD/BD/114049/2015,,52,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In the context of planetary health-defined as the interdependent vitality of all natural and anthropogenic ecosystems (social, political and otherwise)-one enduring metaphor can be found in the concept of Spaceship Earth. Although not without criticism, the term Spaceship Earth has been useful to highlight both resource limitations and the beauty and fragility of delicate ecosystems that sustain life. Rene Dubos, who helped popularize the term, underscored the need for an exposome perspective, one that examines the total accumulated environmental exposures (both detrimental and beneficial) that predict the biological responses of the total organism to the total environment over time. In other words, how large-scale environmental changes affect us all personally, albeit in individualized ways. This commentary focuses the ways in which microbes, as an essential part of all ecosystems, provide a vital link between personal and planetary systems, and mediate the biopsychosocial aspects of our individualized experience-and thus health-over our life course journey. A more fine-grained understanding of these dynamics and our power to change them, personally and collectively, lies at the core of restoring ecosystems balance for person, place and planet. In particular, restoring human connectedness to the natural world, sense of community and shared purpose must occur in tandem with technological solutions, and will enhance individual empowerment for personal well-being, as well as our collective potential to overcome our grand challenges. Such knowledge can help shape the use of metaphor and re-imagine solutions and novel ways for restoration or rewilding of ecosystems, and the values, behaviors and attitudes to light the path toward exiting the Anthropocene.","[Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Telethon Kids Inst, Perth Childrens Hosp, ORIGINS Project, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Prescott, Susan L.; Bland, Jeffrey S.] WUN, inVIVO Planetary Hlth, West New York, NJ 10704 USA; [Bland, Jeffrey S.] Personalized Lifestyle Med Inst, Tacoma, WA 98443 USA","Prescott, SL (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Telethon Kids Inst, Perth Childrens Hosp, ORIGINS Project, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.; Prescott, SL (corresponding author), WUN, inVIVO Planetary Hlth, West New York, NJ 10704 USA.",susan.prescott@uwa.edu.au; jeffbland@plminstitute.org,,,,,,170,1,1,2,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This article offers a brief overview of different conceptualisations of transformation, and outlines a set of practical principles for effective research and action towards sustainability. We review three approaches to transformations, labelled: 'structural', 'systemic' and 'enabling'. We show how different ways of understanding what we mean by transformations can affect what actions follow. But these approaches are not mutually exclusive. We use an international set of examples on low carbon economy transformations, seed systems, wetland conservation and peri-urban development to show how they can be complementary and reinforcing. We describe three cross-cutting practical considerations that must be taken seriously for effective transformations to sustainability: diverse knowledges, plural pathways and the essentially political nature of transformation. Realizing the ambitions of the SDGs, we conclude, requires being clear about what we mean by transformation, and recognizing these basic methodological principles for action.","[Scoones, Ian] Univ Sussex, STEPS Ctr, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Stirling, Andrew; Ely, Adrian] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, STEPS Ctr, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Abrol, Dinesh; Priya, Ritu] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Transdisciplinary Res Cluster Sustainabil Studies, New Mehrauli Rd, New Delhi 110067, India; [Atela, Joanes] African Ctr Technol Studies, ICIPE Duduville Campus,POB 45917, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Charli-Joseph, Lakshmi] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, IE, Lab Nacl Ciencias Sostenibilidad LANCIS, Mexico City 04500, DF, Mexico; [Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Olsson, Per] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Pereira, Laura] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, 19 Jonkershoek Rd, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [van Zwanenberg, Patrick] Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, Ctr Invest Transformac CENIT, Av Pres Roque Saenz Pena 832, RA-1035 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Yang, Lichao] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy, 19 Xinjiekou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Stirling, A (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, STEPS Ctr, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",a.c.stirling@sussex.ac.uk,"Charli-Joseph, Lakshmi/AAL-9894-2020; Pereira, Laura M./L-7258-2013","Pereira, Laura M./0000-0002-4996-7234; Charli-Joseph, Lakshmi/0000-0003-1524-3323; Olsson, Per/0000-0002-9038-4786",ESRC STEPS Centre and Consortium [ES/I021620/10]; Transformations to Sustainability programme; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),"This paper has emerged from the collective work of the ESRC STEPS Centre and Consortium (Grant Number ES/I021620/10).

This article explores challenges that might arise when there is a need to arbitrate among the competing demands of different parties in their efforts to enhance capabilities. Particular tensions can arise when the efforts of particular individuals to enhance their capabilities exert pressure on scarce resources, or threaten the safety and security of people living in precarious environmental contexts. Consideration is given to the need for an ethos of restraint to balance the consumption of resources aimed at facilitating human development on the one hand, with the need to promote environmental justice on the other. The paper highlights research that has investigated how environmental factors can impact on mental wellbeing, including rapid urbanization, climate change related issues (such as weather systems, drought, food insecurity and rising sea-levels), and access to green/blue spaces. As such, the paper explores the important links that can exist between people and the ecosystems in which they live (including the way in which particular cultural beliefs and practices of indigenous groups can be tethered to the land). Elinor Ostrom's design principles, derived from her work investigating the sustainable use of pooled resources, are presented as a helpful means of assisting members of communities to negotiate and apply functioning constraints, which can promote environmental justice whilst not compromising efforts aimed at promoting mental wellbeing.","[White, Ross G.] Univ Liverpool, Clin Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","White, RG (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Psychol, Clin Psychol, G-10,Whelan Bldg Quadrangle,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",ross.white@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,104,6,6,4,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1363-4615,1461-7471,,TRANSCULT PSYCHIATRY,Transcult.

A micro-dataset of the 2016 Canadian census of population was used to derive a comprehensive SES index over 5739 census tracts. The index comprises 49 theoretically-important and environmental policy-relevant indicators of vulnerability that represent diverse aspects of socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnicity status of Canadians. Bartlett's test of sphericity, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, Cronbach's alpha scale reliability, and goodness-of-fit for factor's solution were employed to assess validity, reliability, and consistency in the dataset before applying principal components analysis. Our data revealed 11 statistically-significant multidimensional factors, which together explained 80.86% of the total variation. Levene's homogeneity of variance test disclosed a considerable socioeconomic disparity across census tracts, census metropolitan areas (CMAs), and provinces/territories in Canada. Social vulnerability tends to be geographically stratified across Canada. For example, Drummondville, Saguenay, and Granby CMAs (all in Quebec) had the lowest SES scores, whereas Vancouver and Toronto CMAs had the highest SES scores. Prevalence of spatial variations in the SES scores has significant implications for appraising overall social well-being and understanding the relative social vulnerability of population subgroups. The new place-based SES index has potential for assessing environmental justice outcomes in flood risk management at the census tract level.","[Chakraborty, Liton; Rus, Horatiu; Henstra, Daniel; Thistlethwaite, Jason; Scott, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Chakraborty, L (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",liton.chakraborty@uwaterloo.ca,"Chakraborty, Liton/AAN-2993-2020; Chakraborty, Liton/AAO-3050-2020","Chakraborty, Liton/0000-0002-1241-9584; ",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; University of Waterloo; Statistics Canada,"The analysis presented in this paper was conducted at the South-Western Ontario Research Data Centre (SWORDC), which is a part of the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN).

One way to understand the impact of human activity is to quantify the total environmental pressures by measuring the 'footprint'. Footprints account for the total direct and/or indirect effects of a product or a consumption activity, which may be related to e.g. carbon, water or land use, and can be seen as a proxy for environmental responsibility. Footprints shape climate and resource debates, especially concerning environmental strategies. However, in general, footprints hold a dichotomous producer-consumer perspective that is not unanimously accepted. In addition, the current footprinting system transmits a simplistic message about environmental responsibility that taints the justice debate and jeopardises the validity of policies based on them. Consequently, it is crucial to question who is (and should be) accountable for adverse environmental effects. It is also critical to investigate how the methodological characteristics of footprints shape and affect the efficacy of policies on climate and natural resources. This article examines these challenges, focusing on negative justice and policy implications resulting from assigning environmental responsibility to a sole agent. The article proposes, and morally justifies, the development of a footprinting method that includes justice parameters in an attempt to render fair results that are more meaningful for environmental action. The second objective is to establish the potential of this new framework to promote environmental responsibility and justice while facilitating policymaking. The suggested justice elements aim at turning footprints into a concrete environmental policy instrument framed under the value of environmental fairness.","[Vasconcellos Oliveira, Rita] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Programme Appl Eth, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Oliveira, RV (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Programme Appl Eth, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",rita.bouman@ntnu.no,,"Oliveira, Rita/0000-0002-3169-6923",Norwegian University of Science and Technology,"This study was funded by the programme for applied ethics of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city.","[La Rosa, Daniele; Pappalardo, Viviana] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via S Sofia 64, I-95125 Catania, Italy","La Rosa, D (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via S Sofia 64, I-95125 Catania, Italy.",dlarosa@darc.unict.it,"La Rosa, Daniele/A-8331-2012","La Rosa, Daniele/0000-0002-3975-1405",,,,70,18,18,9,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

These developments have commanded considerable attention in the empirical literature. In this piece, we consider the philosophical dimensions of climate action at the sub-national level. Specifically, we argue that climate action at the sub-national level is an instance of a more general class of cases in which the failure of some collective agent to discharge some duty to which it is subject entails duties for the sub-collectives of which it is comprised to partially discharge that duty. We begin, then, with a discussion of such cases, and a defence of the devolution principle, which sets out conditions under which such duties arise. We then set out the argument with respect to sub-national political communities' duties to take action on climate change, specifically. The article concludes by considering complications arising out of the inevitable fact of partial compliance, drawing upon recent work in the literature on slack-taking duties.","[Umbers, Lachlan Montgomery; Moss, Jeremy] Univ New South Wales, Pract Justice Initiat, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Umbers, LM (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Off 318,Morven Brown Bldg, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.",lachlan.umbers@unsw.edu.au,,"Umbers, Lachlan/0000-0001-7570-0421; Moss, Jeremy/0000-0002-3496-7928","Australian Research Council Discovery grant, 'Ethics, Responsibility and the Carbon Budget'Australian Research Council","This research was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery grant, 'Ethics, Responsibility and the Carbon Budget'.",,54,1,1,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0032-3217,1467-9248,,POLIT STUD-LONDON,Polit.

We found that, on average, compared with communities not involved in disaster declarations, communities with disaster declarations between 1977 and 2014 had lower elevation, more exposure to erosion, less precipitation in summer and fall, larger populations, less population growth, a higher percentage of youth, larger household size, a higher percentage of Alaska Natives, more population below the poverty level, and lower per capita income. This finding is positive, because it suggests that, collectively, communities with greater vulnerability are getting more disaster declarations, which come with disaster aid. However, some of the most vulnerable communities may not be getting all the help they need. In particular, southwestern communities along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers were statistically more likely to get disaster declarations than were ANVs that received attention in the media and the literature for their vulnerability.","[Shen, Suwan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ristroph, E.

The number and scale of flood damage in urban areas will continue to increase in the next several decades due to global trend in urbanization and climate change. Despite the extensive construction of grey infrastructures, many cities in the world remain vulnerable to surface water flooding, especially during the extremely weather events. Since the 1990s, green infrastructure has developed as an alternative and sustainable approach to mitigate flood hazard in urban areas. Despite the great effectiveness of urban green infrastructures in alleviating storm water runoff, there is comparatively little research for planners and designers to determine an appropriate strategy for green infrastructure planning. To address this gap, we propose a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the priority areas to site green infrastructure, based on five criteria: 1) storm-water runoff mitigation; 2) social flood vulnerable group protection; 3) flood sensitive area road infrastructures protection; 4) flood sensitive area buildings protection and 5) environmental justice. The weights of the five criteria are defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We focus particularly on mitigating urban surface water flooding risk and demonstrate how the method can be applied using a case study of Ghent.","[Li, Luyuan; Uyttenhove, Pieter] Univ Ghent, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Jozef Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vaneetvelde, Veerle] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Li, LY (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Jozef Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.; Vaneetvelde, V (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",luyuan.li@ugent.be; pieter.Uyttenhove@UGent.be; veerle.vaneetvelde@ugent.be,"Van Eetvelde, Veerle/AAK-1324-2020","Van Eetvelde, Veerle/0000-0003-2382-6182",China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201506270150],"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from China Scholarship Council, grant ID: 201506270150.",,46,19,19,20,160,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

These quantitative results are complemented by semi-structured interviews with journalists as well as Pacific stakeholders who engage with the media. Reporting on Pacific Islands and climate change focuses heavily on who and what are at risk from climate impacts; reporting on solutions is less frequent and dominated by discussions of migration. This overemphasis on vulnerability potentially downplays the importance of the resiliency and action of Pacific Island communities and positions the Pacific as a site for climate catastrophe, rather than climate justice. However, recent reporting may be moving away from overarching narratives of vulnerability, motivating continued research into these depictions and how they promote or discourage climate action.","[Shea, Meghan M.; Osaka, Shannon] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Shea, Meghan M.; Painter, James] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England; [Shea, Meghan M.] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega, Y2E2 Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shea, MM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.; Shea, MM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England.; Shea, MM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega, Y2E2 Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mshea@stanford.edu,"Shea, Meghan/ABH-5043-2020","Shea, Meghan/0000-0002-7419-6654; Osaka, Shannon/0000-0003-1937-2368","School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford; Green Templeton College, University of Oxford; Rhodes Trust","Research for this project was supported by grants from the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford; Green Templeton College, University of Oxford; and the Rhodes Trust (Sir Peter Elworthy and Warden's Discretionary Fund grants).",,60,4,4,3,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

I explain how the imperatives of the Green New Deal, in conjunction with the shifting sites, scales, and politics of planning for climate change, should encourage planners to reframe their spaces and politics of practice toward a reconceptualized urban regional scale and a new politics of more public participation.","[Goh, Kian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA","Goh, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",kiangoh@ucla.edu,,/0000-0003-1830-2392,,,,46,6,6,4,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

In those places slow to respond, climate litigation has emerged as a method that activists are using to force action. Of the 700 or so pending cases, the climate litigation presently garnering the most attention is Juliana v. United States where 21 youth have challenged the actions of the federal government for knowingly creating and exacerbating climate change. Others have taken to the streets to challenge government inaction on climate change. In both instances, courts are often left as de facto policy makers. This paper seeks to document the precedent-setting Juliana v. United States case and understand the implication of the actions of young climate advocates as they seek to defend their rights to a sustainable future. The paper also explores such youth and civic activism and inaction in relation to sustainable tourism. It calls for better consideration of the needs of children and young people in discussions of climate justice and tourism, particularly the future generations of children and youth who stand to bear the brunt of climate change impacts in the Global North and South.","[Jourdan, Dawn; Wertin, Jani] Texas A&M Univ, Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Jourdan, D (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",dawnjourdan@tamu.edu,,"Jourdan, Dawn/0000-0003-1738-6301",,,,36,2,2,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

It is surprising to find that affordability is not often discussed, given the important roles that affordability and social justice play regarding flood risk management. This article provides a starting point for investigating the potential rate of unaffordability of flood risk property-level adaptation measures across Europe using two definitions of affordability, which are combined with two different affordability thresholds from within flood risk research. It uses concepts of investment and payment affordability, with affordability thresholds based on residual income and expenditure definitions of unaffordability. These concepts, in turn, are linked with social justice through fairness concerns, in that, all should have equal capability to act, of which affordability is one avenue. In doing so, it was found that, for a large proportion of Europe, property owners generally cannot afford to make one-time payment of the cost of protective measures. These can be made affordable with installment payment mechanisms or similar mechanisms that spread costs over time. Therefore, the movement toward greater obligations for flood-prone residents to actively adapt to flooding should be accompanied by socially accessible financing mechanisms.","[Hudson, Paul] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany","Hudson, P (corresponding author), Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",phudson@uni-potsdam.de,"Hudson, Paul/L-1491-2013","Hudson, Paul/0000-0001-7877-7854",,,,56,4,4,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,JUN,2020,40,6,,,,,1151,1167,,10.1111/risa.13465,,FEB 2020,17,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",LZ4XQ,WOS:000516540500001,32103531,hybrid,,,2021-08-07,

Accordingly, to design effective and just earth system governance (ESG), it is crucial to understand how the global economic system affects access to and allocation of environmental benefits and burdens among people and countries around the world and what are the relevant causal mechanisms. By focusing on trade and investment as two predominant elements of today's global economic system, this paper reviews the literature developed within the ESG project in 2008-2017 to explore the relationships between the global economic system and access to and allocation of environmental benefits and burdens. Our review shows that ESG scholarship has begun to highlight the dynamics of unfair access and allocation deriving from the global economic system, ranging from the direct impacts of trade and investment on environmental inequality and socioeconomic opportunities to the indirect equity implications of certification schemes, environmental decision-making processes and environmentally motivated restrictions in international trade and investment regimes. However, it also notes that critical questions about the identity of vulnerable groups and the potential pathways for more equitable sharing of benefits and burdens remain understudied by ESG scholars. Hence, we call for more critical analysis of the role of the global economic system in perpetuating unsustainable patterns of access and allocation in ESG, as well as research about the local impacts of the global economic system on environmental access and allocation.","[Gonenc, Defne] Yasar Univ, Ctr Mediterranean Studies, Izmir, Turkey; [Piselli, Dario] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sun, Yixian] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath, Avon, England","Sun, YX (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath, Avon, England.",defne.gonenc@yasar.edu.tr; dario.piselli@graduateinstitute.ch; ys2327@bath.ac.uk,,"GONENC, DEFNE/0000-0002-5084-2447; Sun, Yixian/0000-0003-2415-2327; Piselli, Dario/0000-0001-9565-766X",,,,60,1,1,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While climate policy is often formulated at the national level, climate impacts are first felt in local communities. This research note, which is part of a larger research project on climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, reviews the recent literature on human system adaptations to climate change at the local level in the Caribbean. It seeks to answer two questions: (1) How are human systems at the local level adapting to climate change in the Caribbean? (2) What challenges exist for local-level climate adaptations in human systems that seek to protect vulnerable communities in the Caribbean? The studies reviewed highlight the importance of considering the vulnerability of sub-populations, protecting their livelihoods, and pursuing institutional cooperation at the local and national levels. In interrogating whether the recommendations for community adaptations in the literature are transferrable to other geographies, this note further emphasizes that understanding the challenges that communities face in protecting human systems against climate change can help policy-makers develop more effective adaptation strategies that centre climate justice.","[Robinson, Stacy-ann; Wren, Caroline] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA","Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",stacy-ann.robinson@colby.edu,,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",,,,40,4,4,0,5,ROYAL DANISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOC,COPENHAGEN K,"OSTER VOLDGADE 10, COPENHAGEN K, DK 1350, DENMARK",0016-7223,1903-2471,,GEOGR TIDSSKR-DEN,Geogr.

Although substantial research has shown how summertime temperature distributions have changed over recent decades in the United States, less is known about howthe heat index-a potentially more health applicable metric of heat-has similarly evolved over this period. Moreover, the extent to which these distributional changes have overlapped with indicators of social vulnerability has not been established, despite the applicability of co-varying climatic and sociodemographic characteristics to heat-related health adaptations. Presented here is an analysis of trends in the median, 95th percentile, and 'warm-tail spread' (i.e., intra-seasonal range between the upper extreme andmedian) of warm-season (May-September) maximum heat index between 1979 and 2018 across the conterminous US. Using 40 years of data from the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset, it is shown that most of the US has experienced statistically significant positive trends in summertime heat, and that both the magnitude of trends and the shape of the frequency distributions of these measures vary regionally. Comparisons with data from the Social Vulnerability Index show that the most socially vulnerable counties appear to be warming faster than the least vulnerable, but that opposite patterns hold for trends in warm-tail spread. These findings may be applicable to further studies on climate change, heat adaptations, and environmental justice in the US.","[Spangler, Keith R.] Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Spangler, Keith R.; Wellenius, Gregory A.] Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Spangler, Keith R.] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Spangler, Keith R.; Wellenius, Gregory A.] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Spangler, KR (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.; Spangler, KR (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.; Spangler, KR (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA.; Spangler, KR (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02118 USA.",krspangl@bu.edu,,,NIEHS (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [R01-ES029950]; Open Graduate Education Program from the Graduate School of BrownUniversity,"This work was financially supported, in part, by grant R01-ES029950 from NIEHS (NIH) and by the Open Graduate Education Program from the Graduate School of BrownUniversity.

Each involves a rejection of scientific method. This rejection inherently lends itself to far-right politics, which is a philosophy of prejudice. The prevalence of such a philosophy in contemporary American political culture, exemplified through climate change denial, has arguably opened the door for a president of Trump's type. Nevertheless, the US Constitution is far more difficult to suspend than that of the Weimar Republic. As a result, US institutional safeguards against a philosophy of prejudice are likely to hold against a short-term assault on environmental justice in a way that the Weimar Republic's constitutional order did not against Nazism's assault on civil rights. The greater threat to environmental protection in the contemporary US situation is the slow erosion of democratic norms by the Trump administration.","[Byrne, Gavin] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Law Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Byrne, G (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Law Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,153,0,0,0,0,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

Within this epoch atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biospheric and other earth systemic processes change due to human activity and can no longer only be ascribed to nature. The far-reaching effects of human activity lead to vulnerability of the earth system. One of the consequences of human activity that has a profound impact in the Anthropocene and that acts as a catalyst of vulnerability, is waste. In fact, Hecht (2018:111) has described the Anthropocene as the apotheosis of waste . Within the context of the Anthropocene this article explores Martha Fineman's vulnerability theory and Louis Kotze 's related and extended framework of earth systemic vulnerability. Both Fineman and Kotze argue for a destabilisation of traditional legal subjectivity Their point of departure is not the Western, liberal autonomous subject, but rather the universal vulnerable subject that demands a responsive state. A responsive state should produce sources of resilience to counteract universal vulnerability. Kotze 's theoretical extension of Fineman universal vulnerability to earth system vulnerability is in step with the nonhuman turn, a movement associated with the late twentieth century, and set on the decentering of humans. Instead, the movement accentuates the agency of nonhumans. By extending the universal vulnerable subject to be more inclusive and encompass the nonhuman subject as well, the vulnerability of other elements of the earth system can also be highlighted. Fineman's response to traditional notions of subjectivity emerged as a critique of formal equality. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the notion of the universal vulnerable subject is relevant in the South African context. The latter is characterised by a human rights approach advocating substantive equality. Although the South African approach to human rights therefore differs from the American one, Kotze highlights other shortcomings of human rights in the Anthropocene. They create space for vulnerability theory to enhance approaches to complex problems associated with the epoch. The concept of the universal vulnerable subject can, for instance, be utilised to question the anthropocentric approach to subjectivity. After establishing that vulnerability theory and earth system vulnerability can contribute to the South African socio-legal discourse on the Anthropocene, the authors explore earth systemic vulnerability of vulnerable subjects in the context of landfills. These vulnerabilities, cautions Kohn (2014:27), are not innate to the vulnerable subject but are produced by relationships between the subjects and their environments. Building on this proviso, the article demonstrates that earth systemic vulnerability is caused by relationships between vulnerable human and nonhuman subjects and the landfill environment on both micro- and macroecological levels. It traces personal, relational and institutional vulnerabilities of both nonhuman and human entities. The article traces nonhuman and human vulnerabilities related to microecological bacterial relationships in the context of waste decomposition in landfills, personal and relational vulnerabilities caused by relationships between waste pickers, other stakeholders and their environment, and eventually global relationships that expose personal, relational and institutional vulnerability of macroecologies. By introducing a broad and expansive universal vulnerable subject inclusive of nonhuman entities, the authors endeavour to contribute to the legal theoretical foundation of waste management by advocating a progressive approach to waste theory. This analysis is analogous to similar work done within the context of climate change. Within the Anthropocene there is room for theoretical work using a wider lens that not only concentrates on the local context, but rather highlights the vulnerability of micro- and macroecologies. Due to scope considerations two other aspects of the vulnerability analysis will be considered in a forthcoming article, in which we will consider how vulnerable subjects use sources of resilience to counter earth system vulnerability and investigate the role of the responsive state in the creation of sources of resilience.","[Grobler, Lizette] Univ Wes Kaapland, Dept Maatskaplike Werk, DWI NNS WNNR Leerstoel Afvalbestuur Samelewing, Bellville, South Africa; [Schenck, Rime] Univ Wes Kaapland, DWI NNS WNNR Leerstoel Afvalbestuur Samelewing, Bellville, South Africa","Schenck, R (corresponding author), Univ Wes Kaapland, DWI NNS WNNR Leerstoel Afvalbestuur Samelewing, Bellville, South Africa.",3924846@myuwc.ac.za; csschenck@uwk.ac.za,,,,,,72,0,0,0,2,"SUID-AFRIKAANSE AKAD VIR WETENSKAP EN KUNS, SEKRETARIS",PRETORIA,"P.

We describe recent developments in assessing pollutant exposures and health threats posed by industrial facilities using or releasing synthetic chemicals to nearby communities in the U.S.Recent FindingsMore people are living near oil and gas development due to the expansion of unconventional extraction techniques as well as near industrial animal operations, both with suggestive evidence of increased exposure to hazardous pollutants and adverse health effects. Legacy contamination continues to adversely impact a new generation of residents in fenceline communities, with recent studies documenting exposures to toxic metals and poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Researchers are also giving consideration to acute exposures resulting from inadvertent industrial chemical releases, including those resulting from extreme weather events linked to climate change. Natural experiments of industrial closures or cleanups provide compelling evidence that exposures from industry harm the health of nearby residents.SummaryNew and legacy industries, coupled with climate change, present unique health risks to communities living near industry due to the release of toxic chemicals.

We find a very distinct overlap between authorship nationality and study location, which is concerning, as some of the world's most polluted and inequitable societies are least represented in authorship. Additionally, we find a dominance of quantitative studies. These results are important for understanding both where future research efforts in this area could best be directed, and how the literature could be enriched by diversified approaches.

The secondary goal is to describe practical ways that environmental issues, environmental justice and sustainability content can be integrated into social work education to better equip professionals with the tools to assist in the continuously growing global environmental issues.","[Ramirez Naranjo, Nelida] Univ Catolica Maule, Carmen 684, Curico, Chile","Naranjo, NR (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Carmen 684, Curico, Chile.",nramirez@ucm.cl,,,,,,24,0,0,5,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0045-3102,1468-263X,,BRIT J SOC WORK,Br.

Yet, little is known about the social and racial impacts of such interventions citywide. In response, our study uses a quantitative and spatial analytical approach to assess whether interventions we call green resilient infrastructure (GRI) protect social groups traditionally most at risk and/or least able to adapt to climate impacts - or conversely, if the aggregate effect is maladaptive and inequitable outcomes (i.e. shifting vulnerability or climate gentrification). First, we performed a pre-post test of GRI siting distribution relative to socio-ecological vulnerability in Philadelphia neighborhoods. Second, we examined gentrification trends in relation to GRI siting and whether these interventions contribute to increasing the socio-ecological vulnerability of historically marginalized populations. Our findings point to a strong negative association between GRI siting and increased minority population, and a strong positive association between GRI siting, gentrification, and reduced minority population. The paper contributes to a better understanding of siting inequities and urban climate injustice dynamics and offers a new conceptual frame for critical urban adaptation research and practice of the pathways that shape uneven and unjust outcomes.","[Anguelovski, Isabelle] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Shokry, Galia; Connolly, James J.

Formal opportunities for youth voices to be heard in environmental governance are slim, although the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) offers a rare opportunity for youth to share their perspectives as one of nine civil society constituencies: YOUNGO. Recent research in Global Environmental Change has called for empirical exploration of justice claims-making by different stakeholders to develop understanding of how justice is conceptualised and negotiated in climate change governance spaces. To date, climate justice claims from youth have not been explored in the academic literature. This paper draws upon rich, ethnographic, longitudinal data on the evolution of justice claims made by a group of youth participants in the UNFCCC to contribute to this empirical gap. In our research, a UK-based case study organisation and long-established member of YOUNGO was studied between 2015 and 2018, including observation of their participation at the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Conferences of the Parties. We find that youth participants first articulated injustices based on perceived future risks to their generation but, over time, switched to solidarity claims about injustices experienced by other groups in the present. Whilst laudable, this impedes their mandate as representatives of younger generations. We also make three theoretical contributions to environmental justice theory. First we expand participation justice theory to both the visible structures of participation (procedural justice) and the informal rules and discourses shaping participation (representation justice). Second we demonstrate the importance of both external and self-recognition for the articulation of justice claims. Third we clarify the relationship between power and justice claim-making, proposing that we must look beneath what is articulated to shed light on the exercise of ideological power that shapes the framing and claiming of justice in environmental governance spaces.","[Thew, Harriet; Middlemiss, Lucie; Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Thew, H (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",H.Thew@leeds.ac.uk; L.K.Middlemiss@leeds.ac.uk; J.Paavola@leeds.ac.uk,"Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X; Middlemiss, Lucie/0000-0001-5185-2033",,,,53,14,14,4,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

The elderly, young, and poor are more vulnerable to air pollution. The risk of air pollution was assessed based on the risk framework published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in terms of three aspects: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This study determined the concentrations of hazardous pollutants using satellite images from 2015 at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. In addition, the study identified vulnerable groups who are exposed to hazardous air pollutants. The study highlighted the degree of vulnerability based on environmental sensitivity and institutional abilities, such as mitigation and social adaption policies, using statistical data. Based on the results, Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province have low air pollution risk owing to good institutional abilities, while the western coastal area has the highest air pollution risk. Three adaption pathway scenarios were assessed in terms of the effect of increases in the budget for social adaptation policies on the level of risk. The study found that the risk can be reduced when the social adaptation budget of 2015 base level is increased by 20% in Gyeonggi Province and by 30% in the western coastal area. In conclusion, this risk assessment can support policy-making to target more vulnerable groups based on scientific evidence and to ensure environmental justice at the national level.","[Park, Sugyeong] Korea Univ, Dept Climat Environm, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kim, Sea Jin; Yu, Hangnan; Park, Eunbeen; Kim, Jiwon; Lee, Woo-Kyun] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Yu, Hangnan] Yanbian Univ, Wetland Res Ctr, Yanji 133000, Peoples R China; [Lim, Chul-Hee] Korea Univ, Inst Life Sci & Nat Resources, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Lee, WK (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",synergyeong@gmail.com; bluegulcy@gmail.com; willpower0129@gmail.com; limpossible@korea.ac.kr; heyevvin@gmail.com; keinesorge2@gmail.com; leewk@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Woo-Kyun/AAP-9837-2020","Lee, Woo-Kyun/0000-0002-2188-359X; Kim, Sea Jin/0000-0002-3627-1596; Park, Eunbeen/0000-0002-0442-7621; Lim, Chul-Hee/0000-0001-7752-0694",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2018R1A2B6005682]; Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute) [2018110C10-2020-BB01]; Environmental GIS/RS Center of Korea University [2018110C10-2020-BB01]; United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) [2017-0014],"This study was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2018R1A2B6005682), and carried out with the support of 'R&D Program for Forest Science Technology (Project No. 2018110C10-2020-BB01)' provided by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute) and the Environmental GIS/RS Center of Korea University.

While the majority of climate litigation has occurred in the United States and other developed countries, cases in the Global South are growing both in terms of quantity and in the quality of their strategies and regulatory outcomes. However, so far climate litigation in the Global South has received scant attention from the literature. We argue that climate litigation in the Global South opens up avenues for progress in addressing climate change in highly vulnerable countries. We first highlight some of the capacity constraints experienced in Global South countries to provide context for the emerging trend of strategic climate litigation in the area. In spite of significant constraints experienced, the strategies adopted by litigants push the climate litigation agenda forward as a result of their outward-looking objective of combating ongoing environmental degradation, and, on a doctrinal level, the way in which they link climate change and human rights. Bearing in mind the limitations resulting from the selective nature of the cases examined, we draw upon Legal Opportunity Structures (LOS) approaches and identify two reasons for innovative cases and outcomes in Global South strategic climate litigation: (i) how litigants are either overcoming or using procedural requirements for access to environmental justice, and (ii) the existence of progressive legislative and judicial approaches to climate change. The strategies and outcomes from these judicial approaches in the Global South might be able to contribute to the further development of transnational climate change litigation.","[Setzer, Joana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Benjamin, Lisa] Lewis & Clark Law Sch, Portland, OR USA","Setzer, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",j.setzer@lse.ac.uk; lbenjamin@lclark.edu,,"Setzer, Joana/0000-0002-7705-7684; Benjamin, Lisa/0000-0001-9696-9817","British Academy through the Postdoctoral Fellowship; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) [ES/R009708/1]; Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS (Canada)","Joana Setzer acknowledges the financial support of the British Academy through the Postdoctoral Fellowship, as well as the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the ESRC via the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) (Grant No. ES/R009708/1).

This relative blind spot in the literature offers an opportunity for rural sociologists and rural studies scholars more generally to elevate their relevance in the academy and beyond. From late-2012 to late-2017, I traversed the state of Colorado interviewing and participating alongside non metro residents from its 24 rural and 23 frontier counties-the latter designation refers to those counties with a population density of six or fewer persons per square mile (the state has 64 counties in total). The argument is informed by 129 face-to-face interviews with residents from across these 47 counties. An additional 144 participant observation-related conversations help further inform the argument. After explaining why rural grievances driving much of today's populism remains a problem for justice scholarship, I document injustices experienced among those interviewed, categorizing them along the three axes of distribution, recognition, and representation. I then offer tentative suggestions for building recognition and empathy between metro and non metro Coloradans. The paper concludes discussing its limitations and the next steps for future scholarship.","[Carolan, Michael] Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Carolan, M (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Michael.Carolan@colostate.edu,,"Carolan, Michael/0000-0002-2691-0454","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2924243]; National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NIFA-COL00725]; Office for the Vice President for Research, College of Liberal Arts; Office of Engagement at Colorado State University","This research was supported in part by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A3A2924243), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA-COL00725), and the Office for the Vice President for Research, College of Liberal Arts, and Office of Engagement at Colorado State University.

However, in doing so, social justice or equity issues tend to come as an afterthought, while there is evidence that environmental challenges and policy responses are not equity (including gender-) neutral. Hence, this paper addresses the question: why should, and how can, equity issues and environmental justice be incorporated into the DPSIR framework? It presents a structure for including equity within DPSIR and applies it. It reviews the literature to bring together data that demonstrates that there is a clear equity perspective along the entire DPSIR analysis. It concludes that although individual environmental policies may succeed to achieve their specific goal in the short term; if they ignore the equity aspects, the policy strategies as a whole are likely to be environmentally unjust, and lead to exclusive and unsustainable development, which, in turn, could further exacerbate environmental challenges. This highlights the need for an integrated approach in efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable development.","[Gupta, Joyeeta] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social, Environm & Dev Global South, B407,Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Scholtens, Joeri] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dankelman, Irene] IRDANA, Malden, Netherlands; [Seager, Joni] Bentley Univ, Global Studies, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Sander, Fulop] Natl Univ Publ Serv, Budapest, Hungary; [Stanley-Jones, Michael] UN Environm, UNDP Environm Poverty Environm Initiat Ecosyst Di, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kempf, Isabell] UN Environm, Poverty Environm Initiat, Nairobi, Kenya","Gupta, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social, Environm & Dev Global South, B407,Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",J.Gupta@uva.nl; Ischoltens@uva.nl; lperch@outlook.com; irene.dankelman@hetnet.nl; jseager@bentley.edu; sandor@emla.hu; michael.stanley-jones@un.org; isabell.kempf@un.org,,"Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660; Scholtens, Joeri/0000-0003-2293-5221",,,,175,10,10,1,3,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zai, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, ISLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property. The evidence supporting these arguments come from survey data on 619 plots, 70 in-depth interviews, village-level transect walks, and participant observations. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging debates at the interface of land use policy, climate justice, and sustainable adaptation. Theoretically, it also contributes to understanding State-society relations, as well as the political economy of eminent domain, often justified through discourses of public benefits.","[Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, 2050 East Iliff Ave Denver, Denver, CO 80210 USA","Nyantakyi-Frimpong, H (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, 2050 East Iliff Ave Denver, Denver, CO 80210 USA.",hnyanta2@du.edu,,"Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson/0000-0002-6407-1970","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), CanadaCGIAR [106690-99906075-013]; Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Canada; Land Deal Politics Initiative (LDPI), International Institute of Social Studies, The Netherlands; University of Denver's Faculty Research Fund [86906-145015]; Department of Geography and the Environment, University of Denve; Public Good Fund from the University of Denver's Center for Community Engagement to advance Scholarship and Learning (CCESL) [86847]","This paper is based on long-term fieldwork that has been supported by different organizations.

Renewed attention to the intersection of these fields has been encouraged by a recent widening in discussions of 'environmental values' to include the role of religious institutions and personal belief in forming spiritual environmental values and renewed attention to the place of ethics and religious institutions in global environmental politics. Following a range of historic declarations by religious leaders, the recent encyclical by Pope Francis signalled a new level of integration between Catholic concerns for social and environmental justice. Yet, much of the continued engagement by large environmental NGOs and governments has continued to ignore the complex interrelation of local, intermediate and transnational religious political ecology. In this article, which is based on data gathered during five years of fieldwork, primarily with British Christian REMOs (religious environmental movement organizations), I probe the complexities of political engagement with religious environmentalism which arise from the many different organizational iterations these groups may take. On the basis of such investigation I suggest that effective high-level engagement with REMO groups will be greatly enhanced by a nuanced understanding of the many different shapes that these groups can take, the various scales at which these groups organize, and the unique inflection that political action and group identity can take in a religious context.","[Kidwell, Jeremy] Univ Birmingham, Theol Eth, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Kidwell, J (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Theol Eth, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,"Kidwell, Jeremy/A-6832-2009","Kidwell, Jeremy/0000-0001-5954-4246","UK Arts and Humanities Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC); Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [AH/K005456/1, AH/P005063/1]","This article is part of a special section of the March 2020 issue of International Affairs on 'Engaging religions and religious studies in international affairs', guest-edited by Katherine E.

As a new contribution, we treat expected damages as costs, which demonstrates that increased damage offsets some benefits of development along hazardous coastlines. The model identifies managed retreat as preferable to beach nourishment when damages exceed a threshold. Regret associated with retreat depends on sea level rise damages and the timeframe of analysis. Considering dynamic complexity of coastal systems, as this model does, may produce climate adaptation plans that better address community needs and reduce risk over timescales of interest.","[Cutler, Emma M.; Albert, Mary R.] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, 14 Engn Dr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [White, Kathleen D.] Us Army Corps Engineers, Headquarters, Engn & Construct, Washington, DC 20314 USA","Cutler, EM (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, 14 Engn Dr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",emma.m.cutler.th@dartmouth.edu,,,DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0014664]; Dartmouth; USACE-IWR,"This research was supported in part by an appointment to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research Participation Program administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Drawing on semi-structured interviews conducted in two different Inuit communities in Canada that have ties to the petition and with lawyers and activists in the transnational climate justice movement, we process-trace the role that the petition has played in promoting discursive and collective action frames related to the recognition of the right to be cold. We argue that the Inuit petition articulated a novel climate rights frame through an innovative combination of legal argumentation, scientific research, and the oral testimony of Inuit communities concerning the ways in which climate impacts were affecting their human rights and traditional practices. Our findings reveal that the resonance of this frame has varied significantly among different actors, influencing the ideas and strategies of climate activists and lawyers around the world, but having limited resonance among policymakers in the United States or Canada or among Inuit communities themselves. Our research thus speaks to the complex challenges and ethical responsibilities that must be addressed in initiatives that seek to draw on international human rights law to influence policy decisions and empower Indigenous communities in the context of climate change.","[Jodoin, Sebastien] McGill Fac Law, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jodoin, Sebastien] McGill Fac Law, Human Rights & Environm, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jodoin, Sebastien] Ctr Human Rights & Legal Pluralism, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Snow, Shannon] Southern Inuit Community NunatuKavut, Happy Valley, NF, Canada","Jodoin, S (corresponding author), 3644 Peel St, Montreal, PQ H3A 1W9, Canada.",sebastien.jodoin-pilon@mcgill.ca,,"Jodoin, Sebastien/0000-0002-4892-2544",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,95,3,3,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-9216,1540-5893,,LAW SOC REV,Law Soc.

It compares the top-down adult policymakers' blueprints for digital citizenship with the performances of citizenship by many young people, who mobilise digital resources to communicate with powerful others as a means of progressing their aims. Drawing upon examples of small-scale teenage activism, and linking these to some of the big questions of the age: climate change, gender equity and social justice, the paper moves beyond discussions of tech-addiction and online passivity to investigate adolescents' strategic engagement in digital spaces to achieve a more equitable future.","[Green, Lelia] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Commun, Perth, WA, Australia","Green, L (corresponding author), Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Commun, Perth, WA, Australia.",l.green@ecu.edu.au,,"Green, Lelia/0000-0003-4587-4679",Australian Research Council via ARCAustralian Research Council [DP190102435]; ARCAustralian Research Council; Australian and New Zealand Communication Association (ANZCA); University of Canberra; Museum of Australian Democracy,"This paper has been supported by the Australian Research Council via ARC Discovery Grant DP190102435: 'Perceptions of harm from adolescents accessing online sexual content', which includes Professor Lelia Green, Professor Brian O'Neill, Professor Elisabeth Staksrud, Dr Liza Tsaliki, Mr Kjartan Olafsson, and Associate Professor Debra Dudek as Co-Investigators.

This is furthering the demand for the implementation of governance relocation frameworks. In order to stay true to the principles of environmental justice while at the same time ensuring an effective policy that meets the needs and wants of affected communities, an adaptive relocation framework requires collaboration between state and non-state actors. It is thus important to pay attention to how non-state actors are incorporated into public participatory climate change adaptation efforts. In order to affectively address previous limitations of public participation, stakeholders must pay attention to already existing power systems. Through a case study approach of a village relocation project in Fiji, I examine the role of power in a climate change adaptation plan that involved the community of Vunidogoloa, local government, and national government stakeholders. I employ Steven Lukes's three-dimensional framework of power to the case of Vunidogoloa, a Fijian village that relocated inland due to coastal erosion and shoreline flooding, to illustrate how the political arrangement of participation reinforced existing hierarchies between the village and the government.","[Bertana, Amanda] Univ Maine, Dept Polit Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Bertana, A (corresponding author), Univ Maine, 5754 North Stevens Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",Amanda.bertana@maine.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant [1519218],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant under Grant #1519218.",,33,1,1,7,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-6544,2399-6552,,ENVIRON PLAN C-POLIT,Env.

But resilience is challenged by global environmental risks and by social and economic trends that create inequality and exclusion. Here we argue that distortionary inequality and precarity undermine social processes that give access to public infrastructure and ecosystems thereby undermining urban resilience. We illustrate how inequality and precarity undermine resilience with reference to social exclusion and insecurity in growing urban settlements in the Asia-Pacific region.

High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts.

However, environmental justice seems to confound the division of collective political agents into discrete occupants of well-defined territories, and that division is one of Nili's foundational assumptions.

As such over the past few decades, a plethora of projects intended to assist communities across the region adapt to future climate change have been developed, channelled through multilateral and bilateral funding mechanisms and implemented in communities across a range of countries. Whether such adaptation projects have been effective in reducing the vulnerability of targeted groups remains unclear. This paper evaluates a climate change adaptation project focused on food security implemented across two communities on Abaiang Island, Kiribati (central Pacific). The project was independently evaluated using the following criteria: appropriateness, equity, efficacy, impact, and sustainability. Data was gathered from focus groups with recipient community members (n = 84) supplemented by interviews (n = 26) with relevant local stakeholders involved in implementation. Results show that while the project inputs (such as tangible and intangible goods and services) were provided, the outcomes of the project were largely ineffective and unsustained amongst the target communities. The main lesson is that local contextual factors-be they social norms, environmental, or local governance and decision-making structures-must be clearly identified, meaningfully acknowledged, and accounted for when designing and implementing local-level adaptation initiatives. This then raises broader questions about who is currently, and who should be defining good adaptation. The answer to this question has ramifications for social justice as well as broader issues for developing effective sustainable responses to the challenges of climate change in such places.","[Piggott-McKellar, Annah E.; McNamara, Karen E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nunn, Patrick D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia","Piggott-McKellar, AE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",a.piggottmckellar@uq.edu.au; karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au; pnunn@usc.edu.au,"Nunn, Patrick/C-7864-2011","Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741",,,,82,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

To verify how climate justice and inequalities are expressed in this part of the Global South, a literature review was performed with selected descriptors referring to climate justice in Latin America. An analysis of the Brazilian National Adaptation Plan (NAP) was also made, taking it as a case study to verify if guidance exists to combat inequalities and climate change impact at once. The literature analysis has shown that studies on climate justice in Latin America are still scarce and present, mainly, a critical theory conception pointing towards capitalism and colonialism as the cause of climate problems, as well as the need for equitable distribution in terms of climate change. With the analysis of the Brazilian NAP, it was observed that the climate justice discourse has not yet been systematically incorporated.","[Campello Torres, Pedro Henrique] Univ Sao Paulo, Energy & Environm Inst IEE, Butanta, Brazil; [Leonel, Ana Lia] Fed Univ ABC UFABC, Program Planning & Terr Management PGT, LaPlan, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, Brazil; [de Araujo, Gabriel Pires] Univ Sao Paulo, IEE, Environm Sci Grad Program PROCAM, Butanta, Brazil; [Jacobi, Pedro Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, IEE, Grad Program Environm Sci PROCAM, Butanta, Brazil","Torres, PHC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 1289, BR-05508010 Butanta, Brazil.",pedrotorres@usp.br,"Torres, Pedro Henrique Campello/AAS-7895-2021; de Araujo, Gabriel Pires/AAO-8910-2021","Torres, Pedro Henrique Campello/0000-0002-0468-4329; de Araujo, Gabriel Pires/0000-0002-2515-4706; Leonel, Ana Lia/0000-0003-4914-143X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2018/06685-9, 2019/05644-0, 2019/18462-7, 2018/02464-8, 2015/03804-9]","This research was funded by The Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP.

While many air quality studies have been carried out in more developed nations, Eastern Caribbean (EC) countries remain understudied. This study aims to estimate the concentrations of air pollutants in the EC nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Transport, recreation and construction sites were selected randomly using local land use records. Pollutant levels were measured repeatedly for numerous 1-hour intervals in each location between October 2015 and November 2018. Weather trends and land use characteristics were collected concurrent to sampling. Across 27 sites, mean NO2, O-3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 26.61 ppb (range: 0-306 ppb), 11.94 ppb (0-230 ppb), 27.9 ppb (0-700 ppb), 52.9 mu g m(-3) (0-10,400 mu g m(-3)) and 29.8 mu g m(-3) (0-1556 mu g m(-3)), respectively. Pollutants were elevated in high urban areas and generally significantly positively correlated with each other, with the exception of PM10. NO2 levels in construction areas were generally comparable to those in transportation areas and higher than in recreation areas. O-3 levels were lower in construction than recreation and transport areas. SO2 concentrations were lower in construction and recreation compared to transport sites. Construction and recreation PM10 levels exceeded transport sites, while PM2.5 was highest in construction areas. Additional bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to assess whether various meteorological, temporal and land use factors including rain, tour season and urban features explained variability in air pollutant concentrations. Tourist season and specific months, more than any other factors, contributed most to variability in pollutant concentrations. These new measurements of air pollution concentrations in an understudied nation may have important implications for health outcomes among exposed EC residents, and provide critical data for future exposure and epidemiologic research and environmental policy.","[Whittaker, S.

However, the current historical moment in the United States is also marked by a postmodern ethos, which is often taken up by the public in a fragmentary manner, highlighted by a general sense of incredulity regarding any form of knowledge. At the same time, the fuller, ethical context of post-modernism complicates how educators may pedagogically address and respond to the tensions and conflict that filter over into the university classroom from the social strife and injustices evident in the society at large. The ethical context of postmodernism warns against changing hearts and minds with a proliferation of the right' . facts assumed to be devoid of attachments of value. It also warns us to be vigilant against the foreclosures, reductions, and exclusions that occur when one draws on metanarratives and universals to mobilize against injustice. Purpose: We explore what it means pedagogically, for teacher educators in predominantly white institutions, to be situated at a historical juncture that calls out for some form. of social advocacy on their part to combat the rise in the politicization of truth and xenophobic and racist sentiment, but are simultaneously compelled to keep in mind the ethical lessons of postmodernism. Research Design: We utilize critical phenomenological analysis intertwined with a narrative accounting of both authors' classroom. experiences as they attempt to engage college students at a predominantly white university with issues of racism, white privilege, and marginalization. We analyze and reflect on the mixed reactions of our students to a presentation on teaching in a diverse world, given by one of the authors to the other author's class of pre-service teachers. Conclusions/Recommendations: For teaching that may facilitate white students' ability to become reflective of their positionality as structured through whiteness and its attendant privilegrs, it is important to envision pedagogical work taking place within environments that can address not only students' cognitive capacities but also the white body schema, which operates at a pre-reflective level. Educators may refrain from reducing white students to reified categories of whiteness by cultivating a disposition of wonder that may allow them to understand whiteness through the lens of emergent realities rather than substantive, ontological forces.","[Sinha, Shilpi] Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY 21402 USA; [Rasheed, Shaireen] Long Isl Univ, Coll Educ, Philosoph Fdn & Divers Social Justice, Brooklyn, NY USA","Sinha, S (corresponding author), Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY 21402 USA.",,,,,,,63,0,0,0,1,TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV,NEW YORK,"525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

The backgrounding of a gender-specific perspective in REDD+ research is often justified from the premise that forests are an inherently male business and REDD+ is only a technical issue. Although millions of women, predominantly indigenous women, are involved in forest work and forestry their importance for natural resource management has been systematically devalued and invisibilized. This paper reviews the gender literature on climate change and REDD +-projects to elaborate on gender-specific subordination of women, with a closer attention to indigenous women, which hinder effective forest protection, fair resource allocation, gender equality and social justice. The paper integrates an autonomous model for climate change adaption lead by indigenous women, that documents not only the local climatic effects on agriculture and forests but develops responses beyond the top downmodel of REDD+. Through relying on knowledge from decades about territories, seasons, trees and cultural life systems indigenous women together with youth and community members were able to sustain food sovereignty in the context of climate change - and the broader goal of people led sustainable development.","[Loew, Christine] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany","Low, C (corresponding author), Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany.",loew@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,54,3,3,4,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Interrelated priorities, including the conservation of biodiversity, ecological restoration, sustainable development, and social justice often underlie these efforts. We collaborated with colleagues in an effort to help guide vulnerability assessment and adaptation (VAA) generally in Southeast Asia and specifically in the watershed of the Sirindhorn International Environmental Park (SIEP) in Phetchaburi Province, Thailand. Reflecting upon our experiences and a review of recent VAA literature, we examine a series of seven questions that help to frame the socio-ecological context for VAAs. We then propose a three-dimensional framework for understanding common orientations of VAAs and how they appear to be shifting and broadening over time, particularly in the USA. For example, key leaders in the SIEP project emphasized social development and community-based approaches over more ecology-centric approaches; this orientation was consistent with other examples from SE Asia. In contrast, many efforts for US national forests have evaluated vulnerability based on projected shifts in vegetation and have promoted adaptation options based upon ecological restoration. Illustrating a third, highly integrated approach, many VAAs prepared by indigenous tribes in the USA have emphasized restoring historical ecological conditions within a broader context of promoting cultural traditions, social justice, and adaptive capacity. We conclude with lessons learned and suggestions for advancing integrated approaches.","[Long, Jonathan W.] US Forest Serv, USDA, PSW Res Stn, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Steel, E.

However, a process for comprehensive and integrative identification, classification, and engagement of all types of water stakeholders for a region or river basin, especially in a transboundary context, is missing for water resources research projects. Our objective was to develop a systematic approach to identifying and classifying water stakeholders, and engage them in a discussion of water futures, as a foundation for a participatory modeling research project to address the wicked water resource problems of the Middle Rio Grande basin on the U.S./Mexico border. This part of the Rio Grande basin can be characterized as having limited and dwindling supplies of water, increasing demands for water from multiple sectors, and a segmented governance system spanning two U.S. states and two countries. These challenges are being exacerbated by climate change; a transitioning agriculture to more water demanding, high value crops; urbanization; and growing demand for environmental services. Moving forward, a core question for this region is how can water be managed so that the three competing sectors-agricultural, urban, and environmental-can realize a sustainable future in this challenged water system? We identified the major water-using sectors who represent competing demands as including agricultural, municipal, self-supplied industrial users, environmental, and a sector we labeled social justice, comprised of individuals who lack access to potable water, or who represent groups who advocate for access to water. We included stakeholders from both the U.S. and Mexico, which is seldom done, who share transboundary water resources in the region. We hosted a series of stakeholder dialogues and obtained results that identified and described their vision for the future of water; challenges to be overcome; and important research questions that could be addressed using participatory modeling approaches. Four broad themes common to multiple sectors emerged: (1) quantity, drought, and scarcity; (2) quality/salinization; (3) urbanization; and (4) conservation and sustainability. Each sector expressed distinctive views regarding the future of water. Agricultural stakeholders, in particular, had strong feelings of ownership of water rights as part of land ownership and a concomitant sense of threat to those water rights emanating from dwindling supplies and competing demands. The contribution of this work is a methodology for identifying, classifying, and engaging all types of stakeholders in the context of a research project, enabling us to compare and contrast views of different types of stakeholders. Heretofore, this has been accomplished in bits and pieces, but never comprehensively and holistically.","[Hargrove, William L.] Univ Texas El Paso, Ctr Environm Resource Management, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Heyman, Josiah M.] Univ Texas El Paso, Ctr Interamer & Border Studies, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Hargrove, WL (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Ctr Environm Resource Management, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",wlhargrove@utep.edu; jmheyman@utep.edu,,", Josiah/0000-0001-6243-9535","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2015-68007-23130]","This work funded in part by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, grant number 2015-68007-23130.",,53,4,4,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,APR,2020,9,4,,,,,,,119,10.3390/land9040119,,,21,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LO8UM,WOS:000533901100030,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

In response to the increased interest in social justice, medical educators are thinking of ways to decolonise education and produce doctors who can meet the complex needs of diverse populations. This paper aims to explore decolonising ideas of healing within medical education following recent events including the University College London Medical School's Decolonising the Medical Curriculum public engagement event, the Wellcome Collection's Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian Medicine exhibition and its symposium on Decolonising Health, SOAS University of London's Applying a Decolonial Lens to Research Structures, Norms and Practices in Higher Education Institutions and University College London Anthropology Department's Flourishing Diversity Series. We investigate implications of 'recentring' displaced indigenous healing systems, medical pluralism and highlight the concept of cultural humility in medical training, which while challenging, may benefit patients. From a global health perspective, climate change debates and associated civil protests around the issues resonate with indigenous ideas of planetary health, which focus on the harmonious interconnection of the planet, the environment and human beings. Finally, we look further at its implications in clinical practice, addressing the background of inequality in healthcare among the BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) populations, intersectionality and an increasing recognition of the role of inter-generational trauma originating from the legacy of slavery. By analysing these theories and conversations that challenge the biomedical view of health, we conclude that encouraging healthcare educators and professionals to adopt a 'decolonising attitude' can address the complex power imbalances in health and further improve person-centred care.","[Lokugamage, Amali U.] UCL, Clin & Profess Practice, Sch Med, London WC1E 6DE, England; [Lokugamage, Amali U.] Whittington Hlth NHS Trust, Womens Hlth, London, England; [Ahillan, Tharanika] UCL, Sch Med, London, England; [Pathberiya, S.

As a result, the lessons to be learned from Cape Town are under active debate in South Africa. We used Q method to examine the structure of perspectives on urban water scarcity among South African water management practitioners. Our results illustrate distinct viewpoints differentiated by focus on corruption and politics, supply and demand systems, and social justice concerns as well as a distinct cohort of pragmatic optimists. Our analysis underscores the significance of public trust and institutional effectiveness, regardless of otherwise sound policy or infrastructure tools. As practitioners explicitly connect domains of competency to solvable and critical problems, integrated systems approaches will require deliberate interventions.

This study draws from current definitions and indicators of fuel poverty in the Global North and juxtaposes it in the context of tropical areas to understand how fuel poverty affects human health, livelihood strategies and social justice in rural communities that live in hot climates. To do so, this paper uses qualitative methods and a conceptual framework to guide the analysis. I call the intersection between vernacular architecture and sustainable cooling practices 'energy relief.","[Mazzone, Antonella] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, South Park Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Mazzone, Antonella] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England","Mazzone, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, South Park Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",antonella.mazzone@ouce.ox.ac.uk,", 叶叶叶/ABE-1619-2020","Mazzone, Antonella/0000-0003-2352-1362",King's College London,I would like to thank King's College London for funding this research as part of my doctoral project.

Across 18 issues, ranging from ecological issues more traditionally the focus of environmental advocacy and scholarship (e.g., pollution; eco-oriented issues) to issues that also constitute human social determinants and consequences of environmental risk (e.g., poverty; human-oriented issues), non-White and lower-income respondents rated human-oriented issues as more environmental.

However, the global climate regime continues to underestimate the need for immediate, radical and powerful action. Dominant framings of the problem continue to emphasise behaviour change rather than system change, and fail to challenge the power of fossil-fuel capital. This failure makes it difficult to be optimistic about the future but there may be hope in a new kind of politics based on non-violent direct action and mass civil disobedience. This form of action is directed at delegitimising fossil fuels and stopping their extraction, and acting as a 'radical flank' in positively influencing political decision-making towards a democratically agreed just transition.","[Somerville, Peter] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England","Somerville, P (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England.",psomerville@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,203,2,2,6,22,POLICY PRESS,BRISTOL,"UNIV BRISTOL, 1-9 OLD PARK HILL, BRISTOL BS2 8BB, ENGLAND",0305-5736,1470-8442,,POLICY POLIT,Policy Polit.,APR,2020,48,2,,,,,355,378,,10.1332/030557319X15661682426163,,,24,Political Science; Public Administration,Government & Law; Public Administration,KZ5UD,WOS:000523326300009,,Green Accepted,,,2021-08-07,

The objective is to analyze the epistemological frameworks of enlightened science and propose a contextualized alternative for research into education aimed at social justice. Intellectual resources of decolonial thinking and feminist thinking, cognitive justice, situated knowledge and the political inscription of the personal are used to produce an investigation that links geopolitical and body-political locations in education. So, the dynamics of onto-epistemic domination and multiple violence, from epistemic to social and bodily, associated with the production of knowledge in the West are reviewed. The epistemological plurality is made visible using the concept of pluriversalism to present the paradigmatic heterogeneity of qualitative research and describe the epistemologies of the South and its commitment to cognitive justice and against extractive research. It is concluded by identifying an emerging epistemological macroformation based on deep reciprocity that wants to make a historical project of realization of life feasible through the entanglement of human and non-human beings on a planetary scale from education.","[Rodriguez-Romero, Mar] Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain","Rodriguez-Romero, M (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain.",mar.rromero@udc.es,,,,,,39,1,1,0,3,"UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, FAC FORMACION PROFESORADO & EDUCACION",MADRID,"MODULO III, DESPACHO 302, CAMPUS CANTOBLANCO, MADRID, 28049, SPAIN",1696-4713,,,REICE-REV IBEROAM CA,REICE-Rev.

Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that many 'environmental' problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different 'senses of justice' and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food-water-health nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the 'elephant in the room'-the failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind.","[Menton, Mary; Peck, Mika] Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Larrea, Carlos] Simon Bolivar Andean Univ, Quito, Ecuador; [Latorre, Sara] Latin Amer Fac Social Sci, Quito, Ecuador; [Martinez-Alier, Joan; Walter, Mariana] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Temper, Leah] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Menton, M (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",mcsmenton@gmail.com,"; Peck, Mika/I-3317-2012","Menton, Mary/0000-0002-9892-2657; Walter, Mariana/0000-0003-4428-1038; Martinez-Alier, Joan/0000-0002-6124-539X; Peck, Mika/0000-0003-0461-0001","Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [GA 695446]","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex; and ERC Adv.

The authors take a critical look at the American Library Association's Code of Ethics, as well as the concept of vocational awe, and recommend challenging the sacredness of neutrality as a core tenet of the profession. Additionally, the authors describe the history of white privilege within libraries and argue that it is time to actively fight white supremacy and disavow the profession's history of replicating racist social structures. Design/methodology/approach This study is a researched think piece designed to encourage critical thought about long-held idealistic beliefs in the profession. Findings This study suggests that despite the profession's history of outwardly valuing neutrality, libraries are not and have never been neutral. Libraries have chosen, time and again, to value white privilege and a white frame of reference to the detriment of librarians and patrons of color. Because many librarians also see the profession as upholding sacred ideals like neutrality, we fall into the trap of being unable to criticize our own profession and practices and, therefore, are unable to make much needed changes. Originality/value This study challenges the long-held assumptions that the profession has taken for granted over the past century. The authors argue that it is good and necessary to question the Code of Ethics, vocational awe and neutrality with the goal of improving the profession in light of the current cultural and political climate.","[Cheshire, Kelsey; Stout, Jennifer] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, VCU Lib, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Cheshire, K (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, VCU Lib, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",kcheshire@vcu.edu; jastout@vcu.edu,,"Cheshire, Kelsey/0000-0003-2719-9753",,,,24,0,0,2,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0090-7324,2054-1716,,REF SERV REV,Ref.

These contestatory spaces in neoliberalised economies are frequently depoliticised through a variety of processes, strategies, practices, and actors. Recently this has been framed as the post-political - whereby dissent is legitimised as democratic only when it does not challenge the status quo of business-as-usual. Most of the analysis and commentary on the post-political has focused on policy or democratic decision-making processes and conflict at relatively broad scales, rather than nuanced empirical case studies. In this paper we draw on an empirical case study to explore how processes of delegitimisation affect climate justice activists in emotional and personal ways. We argue that while the political subjectivities of climate justice activists are fragile achievements, a key aspect that sustains them is an ethic of care for humans and non-humans, both near and more distant, who are affected by climate change. Fostering this ethic of care is one key way for climate activists to continue enacting responsibility for climate justice in a way that contests depoliticising and delegitimisation processes.","[Bond, Sophie] Te Whare Wananga O Otago Univ Otago, Te Iho Whenua Sch Geog, Otepoti Dunedin, New Zealand; [Thomas, Amanda] Te Herenga Waka Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Diprose, Gradon] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Wellington, New Zealand","Bond, S (corresponding author), Te Whare Wananga O Otago Univ Otago, Te Iho Whenua Sch Geog, Otepoti Dunedin, New Zealand.",sophie.bond@otago.ac.nz,,"Thomas, Amanda/0000-0002-8063-5828; Diprose, Gradon/0000-0001-5394-9410",University of Otago,"We would like to acknowledge the mahi (work) that our participants engage in to create a better future.

This paper synthesizes insights from relevant literature on urban climate change governance, climate adaptation, urban planning, social justice theory, and policy implementation to develop three propositions concerning the conditions that must occur to implement just adaptation. First, just adaptation requires the inclusion of socially vulnerable populations as full participants with agency to shape the decisions that affect them. Second, just adaptation requires that adaptation framings explicitly recognize the causes of systemic injustice. Third, just adaptation requires a focus on incremental evaluations of implementation to avoid timeframes inconsistent with advancing justice. We then integrate the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) with the just adaptation literature to develop a framework to evaluate the implementation of climate adaptation. We present two novel modifications to the ACF aimed at fostering policy analysis of the previously presented three propositions for implementation of just adaptation.","[Malloy, Jeffrey T.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ashcraft, Catherine M.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Malloy, JT (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jtq57@wildcats.unh.edu,,"Malloy, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9959-693X; Ashcraft, Catherine/0000-0001-9706-1042",,,,63,5,5,2,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

For some islands, archaeological and paleoecological research offers an important record of precolonial climate change and its interplay with human lives and landscapes. The archaeological record suggests strategies and mechanisms that can inform discussions of resilience in the face of climate change. We detail climate-related challenges facing island Caribbean and SWIO communities using archaeological and paleoecological evidence for past climate change and human response and argue that these cannot be successfully addressed without an understanding of the processes that have, over time, disrupted livelihoods, reshaped land- and seascapes, threatened intergenerational ecological knowledge transfer, and led to increased inequality and climate vulnerability.","[Douglass, Kristina] Penn State Univ, Dept Anthropol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Douglass, Kristina] Penn State Univ, Inst Energy, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Douglass, Kristina] Penn State Univ, Inst Environm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Cooper, Jago] British Museum, Dept Africa Oceania & Amer, Amer Sect, London WC1B 3DG, England","Douglass, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Anthropol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Douglass, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Inst Energy, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Douglass, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Inst Environm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",kdouglass@psu.edu,,"Douglass, Kristina/0000-0003-0931-3428",,,,87,13,13,1,6,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

However, related scholarship has largely neglected conflicts that arise between sustainability and justice goals. A framework is developed to identify three main tensions that planners and activists may encounter in efforts to advance a just transition. First, the 'sustainability-inclusivity' tension involves conflicts between rapid and bold policy action in time-sensitive contexts and inclusive governance processes. Second, the 'sustainability-recognition' tension involves conflicts between sustainability performance and recognition of diverse value systems and rights. Third, the 'sustainability-equity' tension involves conflicts between achieving sustainability performance and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens.

Recent years have seen the emergence of the discourse of just energy transitions, which position social justice at the centre of energy transitions. Authoritarian regimes, because of the established tradition of command-and-control policy making, are considered a critical arena for advancing a just transition globally. A case review of low-carbon energy transitions worldwide reveals an important and significant knowledge gap on justice issues in more authoritarian regimes. Two in-depth case studies in China show that, although social injustice seems to be inevitable for energy transitions in authoritarian regimes, adaptive transition governance mainly through indirect participation mechanisms offers a pathway toward just energy transitions. The study calls for more nuanced and longer-term perspectives of social injustices that emerge in the process of energy transitions in authoritarian regimes.","[Huang, Ping] Univ Sheffield, Urban Inst, ICOSS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Huang, P (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Urban Inst, ICOSS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",p.huang@sheffield.ac.uk,"Huang, Ping/W-1953-2017","Huang, Ping/0000-0002-7573-715X",,,,105,2,2,6,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Accordingly, adaptation to climate change has shifted towards the centre of attention in both policy and research. In this article, we review the last 10 years of adaptation research (2008-2018), with a focus on work within the Earth System Governance network. We use the lens of access and allocation to structure our review and examine how adaptation affects, and is affected by, access to basic needs, basic rights, and decision-making on the one hand, as well as allocation of responsibilities, resources, and risks on the other. We find that questions of justice, equity, and fairness are fundamental to all dimensions of adaptation. The access perspective, for example, suggests that we need to assess vulnerability, understood broadly, while the allocation perspective focuses on questions of responsibility for being vulnerable, e.g. when people live, or move to, hazard-prone areas exposed to climate risk. This also relates to questions of who is responsible for selecting, implementing, and funding adaptation measures. Overall, we find that the framework of access and allocation and its subcategories offer a detailed approach to adaptation and adaptation research, but that it is not intuitive. The notion of climate justice seems to resonate more with both academic and policy debates.","[Grecksch, Kevin] Univ Oxford, Ctr Sociolegal Studies, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Klock, Carola] Sci Po Paris, Ctr Int Res CERI, 56 Rue Jacob, F-75006 Paris, France","Grecksch, K (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Sociolegal Studies, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",kevin.grecksch@csls.ox.ac.uk; carola.kloeck@sciencespo.fr,"Grecksch, Kevin/AAA-1826-2021","Grecksch, Kevin/0000-0002-1913-0134; Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",,,,147,1,1,2,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Motivated by these communication problems, the paper considers the role of the virtuous listener in conversations. Rather than the scripted exchanges of information between individuals, we focus on lively, intra-active conversations that are mediating events. In such conversations, the listener plays a participatory role by contributing to the content and form of the conversation. Unlike Miranda Fricker's negative virtue of testimonial justice, which neutralizes the listener's identity-prejudices in their credibility judgments of the speaker's testimony, we consider the positive virtues of a good listener. These positive virtues enable listeners to productively contribute to the conversation by helping create the fertile epistemic space of a non-adversarial, caring relationship that facilitates critical and creative thinking.","[Pineiro, Josue; Simpson, Justin] Univ Georgia, 107 Peabody Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Pineiro, J (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, 107 Peabody Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",Josh.Pineiro1@gmail.com; justinsimpson@uga.edu,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0353-5150,1874-6349,,ACTA ANAL,Acta Anal.-Int.

This paper examines the extent of fossil fuel divestment campaigns at higher education institutions across Canada, examining key actions and tactics through which campaigns are initiated and mobilized, as led by students, faculty, alumni, and climate justice organizations. Findings indicate that out of 220 accredited Canadian universities and colleges, there are 38 active divestment campaigns and 6 institutions that have committed to varying degrees of divestment. Tactics used in these campaigns include signing of petitions, sit-ins, rallies, and protests, facilitated through face-to-face and online platforms. Findings revealed significant borrowing of actions and tactics among campaign actors, including the use of branding and messaging from international environmental organizations, such as 350.org. This research contributes to scholarly knowledge on how higher education divestment movements and related campaigns for institutional change can influence how sustainability and climate change are addressed. Actors can build on this knowledge to develop sustained collaborative systems to address current and future challenges across institutions and in society at large. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of sharp divisions in terms of how to understand and operationalize L&D, most approaches draw on classic environmental governance, with discrete analogic interventions implemented by States and international actors. L&D is mainly envisioned as an international court of climate justice that identifies the culprits (emitters), quantifies harm, and compensates victims. While digital technologies and algorithmic governance have colonized many germane policy fields and virtually all economic sectors, in the L&D field a substantive discussion on the use of information and communication technologies, algorithms, and user-generated data has been conspicuously absent. By taking the prospect of a digitalization of L&D seriously, this advanced review identifies the seeds of emerging digitalized approaches to L&D through an overview of literature. We focus on examples in three key domains associated with L&D-insurance, disaster responses and risk management, and human displacement. These empirical cases are used to investigate the modes of governance that accompany the digital tools through which L&D could be implemented, and the profound changes in climate politics and justice that would accompany a digitalization/algorithmization of L&D.

The best-laid plans for mitigation would be hard enough to fulfill in a stable climate, but they will be vastly harder in the climate chaos ahead. If simultaneous mitigation and adaptation are still achievable, such a difficult balance cannot also take on the burden of supporting unrestrained economic growth. The failing efforts so far have been dominated by a search for synergistic ways to mitigate, adapt, and grow economies at the same time, while wishing away the predictable trade-offs between these goals. Wealthy polluting countries have enforced this optimistic spirit in international climate debates, in part to counter the language of loss and damage, which they have seen as a direct challenge. Key to their effort has been a reframing of adaptation that flips the focus from the vulnerability of exposed populations to their resilience. However, the reality of implementing plans for resilience is running into problems, and those populations are instead taking up the banner of climate justice. Debt- and disaster-plagued Puerto Rico illustrates the failure of both adaptation and mitigation through growth and the promise of climate justice as a means to articulate other forms of balance.","[Cox, Stan] Land Inst, Salina, KS 67401 USA","Cox, S (corresponding author), Land Inst, Salina, KS 67401 USA.",paul@tpaulcox.com; cox@landinstitute.org,,,,,,99,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Firmly rooted in-and in defense of-an inclusive vision of humanity, an anthropological imagination inspires radical empathy. It offers the scaffolding of a coalitional politics that values the specificity of local struggles but also reaffirms and defends humanity. We must identify the humanity in others, and the common humanity in their struggle, while affirming particular identities and challenging differential privilege: an anthropological imagination inspires radical empathy and solidarity, reminding us, in the words of the World Social Forum, that another world is possible. How people learn to cultivate this anthropological imagination and bring it in the service of marginalized groups is not generally discussed, and rarely taught. This article aims to bridge this gap. On October 10, 2018, Julie Maldonado, Associate Director for the Livelihoods Knowledge Exchange Network (LiKEN), discussed her new book,Seeking Justice in an Energy Sacrifice Zone: Standing on Vanishing Land in Coastal Louisiana, via video-conference with Mark Schuller's Anthropology and Contemporary World Problems class at Northern Illinois University.

Inappropriate approaches to food production interact with hunger, malnutrition and extreme poverty, especially in the tropics and sub-tropics. These approaches, in turn, enhance social deprivation and limit rural development, both of which are drivers of economic migration and civil conflict. Exacerbated by population growth, food systems lie at the heart of these global issues. Here, a planet-proofing approach developed in Africa is presented that illustrates that it is possible to diversify and rehabilitate degraded farmland with species producing highly nutritious and marketable traditional foods in ways that improve food production by conventional staple food crops. Furthermore, it rebuilds agroecological functions and creates new local business opportunities to kick-start rural economies and enhance social well-being. Together, these benefits promote livelihoods and social justice, the mitigation of and/or adaptation to climate change, and the provision of wildlife habitat. This approach offers a highly adaptable model that enhances past investments in the Green Revolution in ways that address both the environmental and social constraints limiting both mainstream agriculture in Africa - and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals globally. Rehabilitation of degraded farmlands can have diverse benefits for sustainability, supporting rural livelihoods, economies, society and culture, as well as contributing to food security. A long-established agroforestry programme in Cameroon illustrates these benefits.","[Leakey, Roger R.

But as a lens for critical analysis, the concept of the Anthropocene is problematic, primarily because it fails to differentiate among humans, many of whom are in conflict precisely because the benefits and costs of the Age of Man have been distributed unevenly. Neo-Marxist critics take such conflicts into fuller account in their argument that a better nomenclature and concept for our epoch is the Capitalocene, a term that captures the fact that our ecological crises have been precipitated not by humans in some undifferentiated and generalized way, but more specifically by the global spread of capitalism and its socio-economic-ecological injustices. These are also conflicts at the heart of many plays, both historical and recent. This essay offers an overview of a number of works that might productively be categorized as Tragedies of the Capitalocene, insofar as they dramatize stories that trace the dynamics of Capitalocene exploitation of both human and nonhuman resources. Plays considered include Cherrie Moraga's Heroes and Saints (1992), Rahul Varma's Bhopal (2001), Kia Corthron's A Cool Dip in the Barren Saharan Crick (2010), Annabel Soutar's Seeds (2012), Robert Schenkkan's The Kentucky Cycle (1991), and Colleen Murphy's The Breathing Hole (2017).","[Arons, Wendy] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Arons, W (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",warons@andrew.cmu.edu,,"Arons, Wendy/0000-0003-4536-6092",,,,34,2,2,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2195-0156,2195-0164,,J CONTEMP DRAMA ENGL,J.

Here, we argue that these changes represent a wider behavioral turn in flood risk management (FRM). The behavioral turn is based on three fundamental assumptions: first, that the motivations of citizens to take adaptive actions can be well understood so that these motivations can be targeted in the practice of FRM; second, that private adaptive measures and actions are effective in reducing flood risk; and third, that individuals have the capacities to implement such measures. We assess the extent to which the assumptions can be supported by empirical evidence. We do this by engaging with three intellectual catchments. We turn to research by psychologists and other behavioral scientists which focus on the sociopsychological factors which influence individual motivations (Assumption 1). We engage with economists, engineers, and quantitative risk analysts who explore the extent to which individuals can reduce flood related impacts by quantifying the effectiveness and efficiency of household-level adaptive measures (Assumption 2). We converse with human geographers and sociologists who explore the types of capacities households require to adapt to and cope with threatening events (Assumption 3). We believe that an investigation of the behavioral turn is important because if the outlined assumptions do not hold, there is a risk of creating and strengthening inequalities in FRM. Therefore, we outline the current intellectual and empirical knowledge as well as future research needs. Generally, we argue that more collaboration across intellectual catchments is needed, that future research should be more theoretically grounded and become methodologically more rigorous and at the same time focus more explicitly on the normative underpinnings of the behavioral turn.

Indigenous peoples experience large burdens of environmental pollution linked to the expansion of commodity frontiers and industrial development, including agricultural, mining, and extractive industries, as well as urban growth, waste dumping, and infrastructure and energy development. Nevertheless, IPs are contributing to limit pollution in different ways, including through environmental monitoring and global policy advocacy, as well as through local resistance toward polluting activities. This work adds to growing evidence of the breadth and depth of environmental injustices faced by IPs worldwide, and we conclude by highlighting the need to increase IPs' engagement in environmental decision-making regarding pollution control.

However, there is growing evidence that ethnocentrism and privilege are shaping coastal management policies while many communities with climate justice issues struggle to build resilience. Particularly, rural coastal communities, contrasting urban areas, have limited access to centralized planning efforts, unique local contexts for outreach, compounding social vulnerabilities (job loss, out-migration, limited social services), and receive less attention from resilience researchers. Following calls to integrate climate justice into resilience praxis, we assess perceptions of adaptive capacity within predominately African American communities in a rural low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. We add a climate justice lens to evaluate the previously-validated Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework. The RCCR is intended to improve planning efforts by providing climate change information, initiating conversations, and contributing to resilience theory. In contrast to its previous applications, engagement led to declines in perceived adaptive capacity. This result highlights that the information sharing goals of the engagement efforts were poorly aligned with community concerns and threat perceptions. Additionally, perceived climate injustices emerged revealing instances of adaptation oppression. This study recommends strategies to rethink traditional extension efforts to improve inclusiveness by deeply interrogating the inherent whiteness of standard modes of communicating climate science.","[Jurjonas, Matthew; Seekamp, Erin; Cutts, Bethany] NC State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Rivers, Louie, III] NC State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Cutts, Bethany] NC State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Seekamp, E (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Coll Nat Resources, 3028C Biltmore Hall,Campus Box 8004,2820 Faucette, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",elseekam@ncsu.edu,,"Cutts, Bethany/0000-0001-7879-526X","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program OfficeNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA11OAR4310148, NA16OAR4310163]; College of Natural Resources at NC State University's Building Interdisciplinary Strengths initiative",This work was inspired by and contributes to a research project partially supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office (grant no.

However, are emerging adaptation interventions equitable by reflecting the priorities of local level vulnerable populations? This research sought to find out whether the engagement of local institutions in projects that seek to achieve country ownership enabled local level vulnerable groups to participate in and influence adaptation decision-making processes and outcomes, thereby enabling them to have a voice in local level adaptation. It used a case study of a Global Environmental Facility-managed coastal adaptation project in Tanzania, which sought to restore and protect mangroves to enable adaptation to sea level rise. Data was generated from 13 Focus Group Discussions and survey questionnaires administered to 629 individuals in three locations on the mainland of Tanzania and in Zanzibar. The findings indicate that community-based organizations were used to facilitate the implementation of project activities at the community level. However, participation spaces created in the project and facilitated by these local institutions were exclusionary and failed to enable vulnerable community groups to have a voice on mangrove restoration and protection. Use of these local institutions altered local level power relations and disempowered other pre-existing and (in)formal local resource management institutions. Community members questioned legitimacy of actions implemented by these local institutions. These findings suggest that working with local level stakeholders to generate country ownership does not automatically guarantee that actions will address the needs of local vulnerable groups. Multilateral climate finance institutions should acknowledge these risks and implement measures to address them.","[Omukuti, Jessica] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 5AH, Berks, England","Omukuti, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 5AH, Berks, England.",j.a.omukuti@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,"OMUKUTI, Jessica/0000-0003-3094-8647","Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law at the University of Reading [DS-2014-002]","This work was funded through the Leverhulme Doctoral Programme in Climate Justice: Ethics, Politics, Law (Grant number DS-2014-002) at the University of Reading.",,102,5,5,3,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,MAY,2020,94,,,,,,,,104525,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104525,,,12,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LE4WJ,WOS:000526720000014,,,,,2021-08-07,

For decades the region has been ripe with political controversies stemming from conflicting interests over its natural resources which all depend on the protection of approximately 1800 km of earthen levees that surround over 60 islands, some of which are below sea level and two-thirds of which are privately owned. This study uses the Q methodology to explore the discourses of the broad range of stakeholders, including farmers, land- and water-based recreation enthusiasts, water exporters, utilities, environmentalists, and government agencies, about flood risk and flood management in the Delta. The results of this study reveal five distinct views regarding the risk of submersion of one or more islands due to either overtopping during high waters or structural levee failures. The findings of this study also elucidate nuanced narratives on the viability of anticipatory climate change adaptation in the Delta. Proximity, sense of vulnerability, values, trust, and views of climate change are the underlying factors in these perspectives. The perspectives identified suggest that resolving decades of distrust among stakeholder groups will remain difficult; however, taking a cultural approach to understanding perspectives may provide an opportunity to open up the conversations to adaptation approaches, and thus fulfill the legal mandate to protect the Delta as an evolving place.","[Rittelmeyer, Pam] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Rittelmeyer, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",prittelm@ucsc.edu,,,"Delta Science Fellowship - Delta Stewardship Council Delta Science Program [R/SF-86, 1167]","I am indebted to all of the research participants for their time and effort to participate in this study.

They promote health and well-being by providing space for physical activity and social interaction, which is particularly relevant for vulnerable groups such as children and older people. As a key element, park vegetation creates favourable environments, as it moderates heat, buffers noise and can be enjoyed by citizens. In this paper, we present the results of a multi-method empirical study conducted in the city of Leipzig, Germany, during the summer heat and drought period in July 2018. Visitation patterns were analysed through qualitative observation and structured counting in two differently characterised urban parks - a newly developed urban park on a former railway brownfield and a long-standing, older park with a mature tree population. The results indicate that park design elements are linked to park use activities and park user age groups such as young children, school children and older people. Young children were identified as mostly using playgrounds and natural lawn areas in the old park, while school children and teenagers tended to use the sports areas and semisecluded spaces in the newly developed park to play sports or to meet in groups and socialize. For older people, sedentary activity was exclusively observed on benches, and non-sedentary activity such as jogging was nearly exclusively identified in the larger, more shaded older park. The number of counted park users, particularly numbers of children and older people, significantly declined at the highest temperature of approximately 30 degrees C. Considering the provision and availability of inclusive design elements that support these use behaviours may increase the motivation of all age groups to use green spaces and to benefit from the services they provide. Planning for a more effective and just provision of ecosystem services requires the consideration of age-specific design elements to invite use from all population groups equally and to contribute to distributional justice.","[Kabisch, Nadja; Kraemer, Roland] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Kraemer, Roland] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Monitoring & Explorat Technol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Kabisch, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",nadja.kabisch@geo.hu-berlin.de; roland.kraemer@geo.hu-berlin.de,"Kraemer, Roland/D-5369-2015; Kabisch, Nadja/ABE-6198-2020","Kraemer, Roland/0000-0001-7115-833X; Kabisch, Nadja/0000-0002-8925-4423",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LN1705A],"This work was carried out within the research project 'Environmental-health Interactions in Cities (GreenEquityHEALTH) Challenges for Human Well-being under Global Changes' (2017-2022) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), funding code: 01LN1705A",,57,13,13,2,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Hence, this paper addresses the question: What arguments are used by shareholders and investors in making their financial flows consistent with LFFU, and what do these arguments imply for: access to fulfilling needs; allocation of related resources, responsibilities and risks; and, the right to (sustainable) development? This paper identifies the different arguments used and clusters them into five investor/shareholder scenarios. It assesses these scenarios using the inclusive (access and allocation) development framework. We find that there is prima facie evidence that fossil fuels and associated infrastructure are doomed to become obsolete and hence stranded, which poses a series of risks for (potential) investors and various stakeholders. Three of the five identified scenarios indicate that Pension Funds and Export Credit Agencies may transfer their risks associated with fossil fuel resources, assets and/or related knowledge to developing countries justified by the latter's Right to Development. Such transfers have negative access and allocation impacts-creating, inter alia, a fossil fuel infrastructure and path dependency in the South and amounting to a de facto transfer of a carbon budget along with carbon dependency and related debt to the Global South.",,,j.gupta@uva.nl,,,Netherlands Research Foundation (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO))Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [W 07.303.104],Part of this research has been conducted within the Leaving Fossil Fuel Underground Project sponsored by the Netherlands Research Foundation (The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under Grant Number W 07.303.104).

The purpose of this research is social regulatory floodplain criteria that may have an impact on various socioeconomic factors at the county and sub-county level. Updated mapping can result in widespread changes to the NFIP Special Flood Hazard Area, while no socioeconomic vulnerability assessments are completed before changes in risk designation or subsidy elimination occurs. These changes can result in additional compulsory flood insurance policies, heightened policy costs, and ultimately produce socioeconomic barriers for lower-income residents. The objectives include demonstrating the potential nationwide implications of increasing community risk with these changes to national policy through a case study from Ada County, Idaho where FEMA began updating the floodplain maps in 2015. Ada County was chosen for being reflective of other communities that may be suffering similar impacts from NFIP policy. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was employed using semi-structured interviews, spatial analysis, and the Spatially Explicit Resilience-Vulnerability (SERV) model to assess potential community impacts. Results indicate increased vulnerability in the revised floodplain. Total annual sales volume, employee numbers, industry sectors, and overall community vulnerability are higher in the revised floodplain. Interviews with community leaders corroborated these results. This case study provides a foundation for further research on the impacts of flood insurance on communities across the USA while discussing the social injustice of a national program that is likely promoting the upward distribution of wealth county by county.","[Frazier, Tim; Boyden, Elizabeth E.; Wood, Erik] Georgetown Univ, 640 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA","Wood, E (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, 640 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",Tim.Frazier@georgetown.edu; eboyden04@gmail.com; exw6@georgetown.edu,,"Wood, Erik/0000-0003-0531-6314",Emergency and Disaster Management Master's Program in the School of Continuing Studies at Georgetown University,"We would like to acknowledge the Emergency and Disaster Management Master's Program in the School of Continuing Studies at Georgetown University for its support of this paper and members of Dr. Frazier's research center who contributed to this project.

Unions and labor movements, like other social actors, are reinventing themselves in response to the climate crisis by incorporating climate issues into their traditional workplace-related struggles for the protection of workers' well-being and jobs. This article presents an extended case study (from 2015 to 2019) of the Portuguese Trade Union Confederation's participation in the ongoing climate jobs campaign led by climate justice movements. The analysis constructs a dialogue between two conceptual frameworks-social movement unionism and environmental labor studies-to interpret the metamorphosis taking place in the Portuguese labor movement.","[Kenfack, Chrislain Eric] Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Kenfack, CE (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",kenfack@ualberta.ca,,,,,,72,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2471-4607,,,J LABOR SOC,J.

Yet, despite the extensive discussion surrounding community resilience, operationalizing the concept remains challenging. The dominant approaches for assessing resilience focus on either evaluating community characteristics or infrastructure functionality. While both remain useful, they have several limitations to their ability to provide actionable insight. More importantly, the current conceptualizations do not consider essential services or how access is impaired by hazards. We argue that people need access to services such as food, education, health care, and cultural amenities, in addition to water, power, sanitation, and communications, to get back some semblance of normal life. Providing equitable access to these types of services and quickly restoring that access following a disruption are paramount to community resilience. We propose a new conceptualization of community resilience that is based on access to essential services. This reframing of resilience facilitates a new measure of resilience that is spatially explicit and operational. Using two illustrative examples from the impacts of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we demonstrate how decisionmakers and planners can use this framework to visualize the effect of a hazard and quantify resilience-enhancing interventions. This equitable access to essentials approach to community resilience integrates with spatial planning, and will enable communities not only to bounce back from a disruption, but to bound forward and improve the resilience and quality of life for all residents.","[Logan, Tom M.] Univ Canterbury, Civil & Nat Resources Engn, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Guikema, Seth D.] Univ Michigan, Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Logan, TM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Civil & Nat Resources Engn, Canterbury, New Zealand.",tom.logan@canterbury.ac.nz,,"Logan, Thomas/0000-0002-9209-3018",Rackham PreDoctoral Fellowship; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1638197]; One Concern Inc.,"TML conducted themajority of this research as a graduate student at the University of Michigan with the support of a Rackham PreDoctoral Fellowship.

However, with a divided Congress, amendments to these two landmark pieces of legislation have become increasingly difficult to compromise and negotiate solutions to the most salient environmental problems in today's society, namely, climate change. The primary impacts of climate change are numerous: however, the changing weather patterns and factors affecting environmental health are at the highest risk. In the policy issue of environmental justice, Presidents Clinton and Obama used executive orders in an attempt to remedy some of the latent problems for minority and low-income populations, most notably, the regulation of carbon dioxide and methane. The coal industry lobbied candidate Trump who promised to rollback the regulations that affected that industry. This research investigates the executive orders issued in the Trump administration, presents a discussion of administrative rulemaking and federalism, and assesses the status of the executive orders to date.","[Rios, Jo Marie] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Social Sci, Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Corpus Christi, TX USA","Rios, JM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Social Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5826, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",jo.rios@tamucc.edu,,,,,,31,1,1,4,13,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Drawing upon the equity planning framework and developing a broader conceptualization of what equity means can enhance urban heat management. Here I ask whether areas in Baltimore (MD), Dallas (TX), and Kansas City (MO) targeted for disinvestment in the past through practices like redlining are now more exposed to heat. I compare estimates of land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery across the four-category rating system used to guide lending practices in cities around the United States, summarize the demographic characteristics of current residents within each of these historical designations using U.S. Census data, and discuss the connection between systematic disinvestment and exposure to heat. LST and air temperatures are not equivalent, which makes it difficult to reconcile existing research on the human health impacts of heat exposure that rely on a sparse network of air temperature monitoring stations with more granular LST data. Areas of these cities that were targeted for systematic disinvestment in the past have higher mean land surface temperatures than those that received more favorable ratings. Poor and minority residents are also overrepresented in formerly redlined areas in each of the three study cities. Takeaway for practice:By examining areas that have experienced sustained disinvestment, cities may be able to more quickly narrow the focus of heat mitigation planning efforts while furthering social equity. Efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of rising temperatures in U.S. cities must be tailored to the local climate, built environment, and sociodemographic history. Finally, geospatial data sets that document historical policies are useful for centering and redressing current inequalities when viewed through an equity planning lens.","[Wilson, Bev] Univ Virginia, Sch Architecture, Urban & Environm Planning, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Wilson, B (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Sch Architecture, Urban & Environm Planning, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",bw6xs@virginia.edu,,,,,,99,6,6,8,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

There is a growing recognition among scholars and policymakers that curbing fossil fuel supply (as well as demand) can be a valuable part of the climate policy toolbox; this raises the question of where and how the tool should be applied. This paper explores how to equitably manage the social dimensions of a rapid transition away from fossil fuel extraction. Fossil fuel extraction leads to benefits for some people (such as extraction workers) and harms for others (such as pollution-affected communities). A transition must respect and uphold the rights of both groups, while also staying within climate limits, as climate impacts will fall most heavily on the world's poor. This paper begins by reviewing how extraction affects economies and communities and the different transitional challenges they face. Based on that review, it then examines three common equity approaches - economic efficiency, meeting development needs, and effort-sharing. Drawing lessons from the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, the paper proposes five principles as a basis for equitably curbing fossil fuel extraction within climate limits: (1) Phase out global extraction at pace consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C; (2) Enable a just transition for workers and communities; (3) Curb extraction consistent with environmental justice; (4) Reduce extraction fastest where doing so will have the least social costs; (5) Share transition costs fairly, according to ability to bear those costs.Key policy insights: Fossil fuel extraction is unlikely to be a viable path to development because the Paris Agreement goals require most fossil fuel use to be ended within a generation; Extraction should be phased out fastest in diversified, wealthier economies that can better absorb the transitional impacts; Governments of extracting countries should enact ambitious industrial policy to diversify their economies, alongside economic and employment policies to enable a just transition; The costs of a just transition should be borne by those most able to bear it: poorer countries can reasonably demand financial support.","[Muttitt, Greg] Oil Change Int, Washington, DC 20003 USA; [Kartha, Sivan] Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA USA","Muttitt, G (corresponding author), Oil Change Int, Washington, DC 20003 USA.",greg.muttitt@gmail.com,,"Muttitt, Greg/0000-0002-2323-3937",KR Foundation,This work was supported by KR Foundation.,,131,13,13,5,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

It is estimated that over two-hundred million forest peoples-including indigenous peoples and local communities-live within and depend upon tropical forests. To successfully mitigate climate change, we must find new forms of collaboration that meet the goals of forest-dependent communities for secure land rights, equitable participation in decision-making, and dignified livelihoods in conjunction with meeting commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, 34 subnational governments and 18 indigenous and local community organizations announced their endorsement of the Guiding Principles for Collaboration between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Local Communities. The Guiding Principles of Collaboration (GPC) are a set of 13 universal tenets which lay out a blueprint for collaboration between subnational state actors, indigenous peoples and local communities to recognize rights, support livelihoods, strengthen participation of forest-dependent communities in decision-making, and protect indigenous and community environmental defenders within the context of joint action for climate change mitigation. Their implementation would advance the integration of climate justice in subnational efforts for forest conservation. Taking the GPC as a point of departure, we explore how jurisdictional approaches to sustainability can protect and enhance the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples (IP) and local communities (LC). We develop and apply a suite of indicators to assess existing conditions across 11 tropical forest jurisdictions toward meeting the commitments described in the GPC. Our findings suggest that while the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities are recognized within national legal frameworks, implementation and security of those rights is uneven across subnational jurisdictions. Participation of IP and LC is not yet formalized as part of jurisdictional climate change mitigation initiatives in most cases, limiting their potential to inform policy outcomes and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Monitoring the implementation of the GPC may foster greater accountability for commitments, as well as collective action and learning to support regional transformations to sustainability.","[DiGiano, Maria; Stickler, Claudia; David, Olivia] Earth Innovat Inst, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA","DiGiano, M (corresponding author), Earth Innovat Inst, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",mdigiano@earthinnovation.org,,,"International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) of Germany [16_III_071]; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) (Forests, Farms and Finance Initiative)CGIAR [QZA-0701 QZA-16/0162]; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)CGIAR; International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)CGIAR","This research was supported by grants to Earth Innovation Institute from the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) of Germany (Grant 16_III_071_Global_A_Low-Emissions Rural Development), and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) (Grant: QZA-0701 QZA-16/0162 -Forests, Farms and Finance Initiative).

In particular, these papers provide compelling evidence that to comprehend fully the future of Asian cities in the Anthropocene, it is necessary to understand their related topographies, their water systems and, also, their practices and politics of water distribution.

To answer this question, an interdisciplinary analysis is needed informed by a theoretical framework of how air pollution and climate change are largely discounted in the complex realpolitik of policy and regulation for shale gas development in England. Sources, including official government, regulatory and planning documents, as well as industry and scientific publications are examined and benchmarked against the science and ethical and environmental justice criteria. Further, our typology illustrates how the process works drawing on an analysis of official policy documents and statements on planning and regulatory oversight of shale exploration in England, and material from industry and their consultants relating to proposed shale oil and gas development. Currently the oil, gas and chemical industries in England continue to dominate and influence energy and feedstock-related policy making to the detriment of ethical and environmental justice decision making with significant consequences for public health.","[Watterson, Andrew] Univ Stirling, Occupat & Environm Hlth Res Grp, Fac Hlth Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Dinan, William] Univ Stirling, Commun Media & Culture, Fac Arts & Humanities, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland","Watterson, A (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Occupat & Environm Hlth Res Grp, Fac Hlth Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",aew1@stir.ac.uk; william.dinan1@stir.ac.uk,,"Dinan, William/0000-0002-4259-2150","University of Stirling, Scotland","The University of Stirling, Scotland, funded the study.",,182,2,2,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This article examines the relationship between policy representation in climate mitigation, business and food policies, and the implementation of sustainable practices in professional kitchens. The restaurant industry is a major consumer of natural resources as many practices throughout the supply chain are carbon intensive. Following Carol Bacchi's What is the problem represented to be? framework, this article examines the extent to which policy representation of sustainability and food governance influences everyday practices in professional kitchens in Glasgow, Scotland, based on research undertaken in 2019. This study revealed that climate change, business and food policies promote the idea that sustainability will be achieved alongside economic growth, without considering the complexities of social inequalities. The policies significantly overlook the private sector responsibility to transform away from unsustainable practices, whilst the potential approaches to improve social and environmental sustainability are obscured. The article concludes by calling for policies to integrate issues of social justice in the representation of the problem to produce more transformative and socially equitable outcomes.","[Wylie, Adele] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Wylie, A (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",adelewylie3@gmail.com,,,,,,57,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ALICANTE, INST UNIV INVESTIGACION ESTUDIOS GENERO",ALICANTE," APDO 99, CARRETERA SAN VICENTE RASPEIG S-N, ALICANTE, SPAIN",,1989-9998,,FEMINISMO-S,Feminismo-s,JUN,2020,,35,,,,,95,125,,10.14198/fem.2020.35.04,,,31,Women's Studies,Women's Studies,MV0QG,WOS:000556067700004,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

The development of a green economy is critical for combating climate change, as well as for addressing rising unemployment and the expansion of precarious work. My research is based on a qualitative study of environmental-labor coalitions in California, United States, and British Columbia, Canada, including fifty-six in-depth digitally recorded interviews with environmental and labor movement leaders and policymakers. The findings point to the importance of three key mechanisms that shape the success of these coalitions: (1) drawing on the strength of organizational diversity, (2) fostering relationships of trust that allow organizations to adopt flexible ideologies, make concessions and tradeoffs, and create hybrid identities, and (3) frame bridging by local social justice organizations to mitigate conflict between environmental and labor movements.","[Robinson, Joanna L.] York Univ, Glendon Coll, Dept Sociol, 2275 Bayview Ave, Toronto, ON M4N 3M6, Canada","Robinson, JL (corresponding author), York Univ, Glendon Coll, Dept Sociol, 2275 Bayview Ave, Toronto, ON M4N 3M6, Canada.",jrobinson@glendon.yorku.ca,,,Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),The author would like to thank the Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) for funding the research through a fellowship grant.

As a result, climate change is center stage because countries and their governments, organisations as well as multinationals are battling to contain its effects. Through the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement, countries pledged to mitigate climate change in their capacities. However, some of these contributions are overly ambitious for poor countries like Cambodia measuring it against their national capacities. Therefore, this paper investigates Cambodia's official position on climate change vis-a-vis its current environmental practices, mitigation policies, and strategies by analysing three major climate change amplifiers - waste, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions to determine whether it is the environmentally friendly country it portrays itself to be internationally or simply greenwashing. This paper merges both qualitative content and document analyses of official policy documents and agreements, reports, data, and publications of major climate change stakeholders in Cambodia. By in-depth analysis, it is established that Cambodia shows commitment to combating climate change, however, with current environmental practices and policy implementation, Cambodia moves towards solving the pressing issues of hunger and poverty with economic growth and development as a priority before consideration for the climate and environment. On this basis, it is recommended that the least developed countries set and maintain realistic climate goals and continue to receive external support from developed countries with monitoring and evaluating systems established to be up to par in the fulfilment of global agendas such as Agenda 2030.","[Osekita, Oluwadamilola Titilope] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania","Osekita, OT (corresponding author), Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",ddosekita@gmail.com,,,,,,51,0,0,2,3,"UNIV MALAYA, DEPT SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES, FAC ARTS & SOCIAL SCIENCES",KUALA LUMPUR,"UNIV MALAYA, DEPT SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES, FAC ARTS & SOCIAL SCIENCES, KUALA LUMPUR, 50603, MALAYSIA",1823-4127,2600-8653,,JATI-J SOUTHEAST ASI,JATI-J.

It concludes that (a) although international trade, investment and aid aim to enhance access, efficiently allocate resources and reduce risk, in practice the volume of trade and investment, the geographical distance between production and consumption, the pursuit of competitiveness and use of market instruments have concentrated wealth at great cost to socio-ecological justice; (b) research on food, water, energy, climate change and biodiversity reveal multiple linkages among the sustainable development goals, underlining the limitations of sectoral and incremental approaches to socio-ecological justice, for example, for smallholders; (c) while access issues are becoming difficult for politicians to ignore, allocation issues are being side-stepped because they draw too much attention to the underlying causes of inequality and poverty, (d) corrective justice is not enough, substantive justice approaches are needed emphasizing a rights-based framework and allocation cannot be exclusively left to market forces and mechanisms when it concerns public and merit goods; and (e) the terms access and allocation, although individually used, are not popular as a paired framework in the socio-ecological justice literature, but remain highly salient and cover the key justice issues for improving earth system governance.","[Gupta, Joyeeta] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Lebel, Louis] Ching Mai Univ, Dept Social Sci & Dev, Chiang Mai, Thailand","Gupta, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Gupta, J (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.",j.gupta@uva.nl,,,,,,30,4,4,3,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

What is not well documented in the literature is exactly how students learn through this type of experiential education. Using students as co-researchers in an action research model, this study sought to better understand how students learn about poverty through a poverty simulation, which is a pedagogical tool known to impact students' attitudes and understandings of poverty. Results map closely with transformational learning theory, including that personal background and previous learning experiences shaped students openness and willingness to engage in a new learning opportunity. Students reflected how the climate of the learning environment, in this case the poverty simulation, was as a significant factor that impacted the learning process. Finally, findings from this study indicate that students had both an increased interest in issues of social justice and felt less judgmental of people experiencing poverty following the simulation. Additionally, the student research team itself had a learning opportunity which resulted in an increased interest and appreciation for participatory research.","[Roll, Susan] Calif State Univ Chico, Sch Social Work, 400 W First St, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Browne, Laurie] Calif State Univ Chico, Recreat Hospitality & Pk Management, Chico, CA 95929 USA","Roll, S (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Chico, Sch Social Work, 400 W First St, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",sroll@csuchico.edu,,,,,,41,1,1,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1476-7503,1741-2617,,ACTION RES-LONDON,Action Res.,JUN,2020,18,2,,,SI,,230,250,,10.1177/1476750317723966,,,21,"Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,LQ1JA,WOS:000534765800007,,,,,2021-08-07,

Here, we provide an up-to-date review of the key characteristics of GI research by focusing on the countries of the European Union. We consider the conceptualizations of GI, key research priorities, and thematic clusters within the existing literature. We demonstrate that the ambiguous definition of GI has generated a high diversity in research objectives and outputs. We also show that urban green spaces and ecosystems services are the most frequent topics and that more research is needed on the social aspects of GI.

The luxury effect posits a positive association between biodiversity and socioeconomic status in urban areas, and is thus reflective of environmental injustice, as the benefits associated with biodiversity are not equitably shared across society. We aimed to determine the generality of the luxury effect, and to identify the factors causing its variation across published studies. Location Urbanized landscapes globally. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Terrestrial animals and plants. Methods We tested the luxury effect across a sample of 337 estimates of the relationship between biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status from 96 studies via a meta-analysis, addressing three hypotheses: (a) the luxury effect is more pronounced where water availability is limited, (b) the luxury effect is more pronounced in developing than developed countries, (c) the luxury effect is stronger in exotic compared to native species. Results There was a significant overall luxury effect: there was a positive association between terrestrial biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status. The strength of the luxury effect was greater in arid areas. There was limited support for a stronger luxury effect in exotic species, but no support for any association with development status. Main conclusions Many key and emerging climate impacts are concentrated in urban areas. Therefore, the degree of environmental injustice represented by the luxury effect may be amplified in the future, especially in arid regions. The objective to increase urban biodiversity through more equitable management and provision of water resources could form part of a wider strategy for sustainable development of cities to promote environmental justice, enhancing the quality of life of urban residents across all sectors of society. Challenges remain to ensure that any such strategy prioritizes conservation goals for native biodiversity.","[Chamberlain, Dan; Caprio, Enrico] Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Via Accademia Albertina 13, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Reynolds, Chevonne] Univ Witwatersrand, Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Braamfontein, South Africa; [Reynolds, Chevonne; Amar, Arjun] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Henry, Dominic] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Henry, Dominic] Endangered Wildlife Trust, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Batary, Peter] Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Lendulet Landscape & Conservat Ecol, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary","Chamberlain, D (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Via Accademia Albertina 13, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",dan.chamberlain99@gmail.com,"Batary, Peter/A-2349-2008; Chamberlain, Dan/K-1809-2015; amar, arjun/F-3815-2011; Caprio, Enrico/G-1310-2011","Batary, Peter/0000-0002-1017-6996; Chamberlain, Dan/0000-0002-5381-2024; amar, arjun/0000-0002-7405-1180; Henry, Dominic/0000-0001-7375-141X; Caprio, Enrico/0000-0002-5997-5959; Reynolds, Chevonne/0000-0002-2345-7017",Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme of Hungary [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00019],"We would like to thank the following for helping us to track down data, and for their encouraging advice: Jeff Ackley, Adam Berland, Katharine Bowgen, K.

In response to calls for northern geographers to better attend to new forms of coloniality and knowledge production, I take seriously indigenous agendas for development, land, and sovereignty to critique Agenda 2030 with decolonial territorial agendas and theories of environmental justice. I argue that the implementation of Agenda 2030 has reconfigured the borderlands between international development and indigenous territorial agendas. In a drastic reworking of the boomerang effect, development infrastructure is being disconnected from anti-extractive indigenous territorial politics, as the modes of engagement between states, the private sector, and NGOs are reconfigured by the unifying agenda of sustainable development - weakening both indigenous struggles for territorial sovereignty and the environmental remit of the SDGs. An environmental justice perspective locates the case of the Territorio Indigena y Parque Nacional Isiboro (TIPNIS) Secure case within a bigger struggle between local claims to land and global extractive capital, foregrounding that decolonial agendas for territory are entangled with contemporary extractive capitalism. In seeking consensus between states, the private sector, and civil society, the SDGs minimise the sites of conflict that instruct sustainable development, revealing both a critical weakness of the SDGs and a pathway towards their greater effectiveness.","[Hope, Jessica] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Hope, J (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",jch31@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Hope, Jessica/0000-0002-8726-8880",Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) - Environment & Sustainability Grant; University of Bristol - Vice-Chancellor's Fellowship,Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) - Environment & Sustainability Grant.

Incentive -based pol- icy instruments are key tools for meeting these goals, yet their effectiveness might be undermined by such factors as social norms regarding whether payments are considered fair. We investigated the causal link between equity and conservation effort with a randomized real -effort experiment in forest conservation with 443 land users near a tropical forest national park in the Vietnam- ese Central Annamites, a global biodiversity hotspot. The experi- ment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribu- tion. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by in- equality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive -based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substan- tially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing pay- ment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change.","[Loft, Lasse] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Working Grp Governance Ecosyst Serv, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Gehrig, Stefan] Private Address, D-10961 Berlin, Germany; [Salk, Carl] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Rommel, Jens] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75651 Uppsala, Sweden","Loft, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Working Grp Governance Ecosyst Serv, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",lasse.loft@zalf.de,"Rommel, Jens/J-1291-2019; Loft, Lasse/ABE-4006-2020; Gehrig, Stefan/L-7990-2019","Rommel, Jens/0000-0002-0693-8134; Loft, Lasse/0000-0001-5640-7289; Gehrig, Stefan/0000-0002-5270-9578; Salk, Carl/0000-0003-2833-8292",Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2019-01101]; Belmont Forum via Vetenskapsradet [2017-06442],"We are grateful for field support from World Wildlife Fund Vietnam and in particular to Anh Nguyen Quang Hoa and his team.

The principle at stake,the limit, protects those who are very badly off from bearing the costs of climate change mitigation. The persistent noncompliance of developed states with their obligations toward burden sharing, however, means that this principle is increasingly in tension with successful climate change mitigation, given it seems to require that those in poverty have continued access to emissions in cases where alternative forms of energy are not provided. In the first half of the paper I outline this tension and show how the dominant expression of the limit in the literature, advanced by Henry Shue, must be abandoned. I argue that any attempt to articulate the limit in current circumstance, where the carbon budget is very scarce, must consider the climate harm associated with continued subsistence emissions. The second half of the article defends a principle,the exemption, which is best able to maintain the strong commitment to shielding those below the minimal threshold from the costs of mitigation, even in light of the potential harm that will result if they require emissions to fuel their energy needs.","[McLaughlin, Alex] Univ Reading, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Reading, Berks, England","McLaughlin, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Reading, Berks, England.",a.mclaughlin@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [DS-2014-002],This work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust.

They have already felt the fire of climate change in terms of loss of livelihoods, homelessness, and even life harm. They have begun recently to experience the fire of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. The fallout of this situation, thus, comes in form of mass-exodus, and social and political conflicts at the margin. This article tells a story of how the postcolonial government in India, like its predecessor i.e. the British colonialists, would orchestrate a concerted effort in accumulation-based development in the name of conservation of SDB. Critically engaging the trajectory of policy interventions including the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the Draft National Forest Policy, 2018 and the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers (Recognition of forest rights) act, 2006, it explores the dynamic way in which the government uses the climate change and conservation excuse to evict the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers from the forestlands. In conclusion, this article argues why we should go beyond the capitalist 'growth' narrative in order to formulate a more grounded climate and social justice legislation.","[Roy, Dayabati] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland","Roy, D (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",,,,Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,This work was supported by Academy of Finland.,,29,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0803-9410,1891-1765,,FORUM DEV STUD,Forum Dev.

Specifically, the authors consider how youth of color engage the educational context of an 11th grade English language arts (ELA) class as a basis for (re)imagining their history, culture and themselves to construct counter-narratives away from framing their lived educational experiences as failures, deficient and depicted in damage-centered (Tuck, 2009) ways. The research engages the process and challenges of creating this type of space within a school setting, as well as examining the ways in which students envision these locations. Design/methodology/approach Critical ethnography centered the emphasis on youth engagement for social change, as well as the inquiry on how the classroom space was constructed, shared and navigated by the students and ourselves (Madison, 2005). In addition, the research design reflects critical ethnography through the use of prolonged participation in the field (nine and half months), a focus on culture (specifically school and classroom culture/climate) and a critical theory-based framework [hybridity, third space and youth participatory action research (YPAR)]. Findings Three major themes emerged from the data that demonstrate how instructors and students collectively engaged in a third space through the YPAR project. These themes include developing an ethic of care with students and among instructors, cultivating an atmosphere of social justice awareness and the contrast of the classroom space with the wider-Hillside Vocational High School environment. Originality/value The study engages the use of YPAR within a high school class that became a unique space for students to learn and develop. The ELA class did not just reflect adding the first space and second space together or merging the two. Instead, it seemed to demonstrate the creation of a new type of space or the development of a third space. In this space, students could bring and bridge their out-of-school and in-school experiences to develop new knowledge and ways of seeing the world.","[Green, Keisha L.; Morales Morales, Daniel] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Teacher Educ & Curriculum Studies, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [George Mwangi, Chrystal; Bettencourt, Genia M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Educ Policy Res & Adm, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Green, KL (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Teacher Educ & Curriculum Studies, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",klgreen@umass.edu; demorale@educ.umass.edu; chrystal@umass.edu; gbettenc@umass.edu,"Bettencourt, Genia M./O-3814-2016","Bettencourt, Genia M./0000-0003-4663-3631",,,,44,0,0,2,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1175-8708,,,ENGL TEACH-PRACT CRI,Eng.

It brings together rigorous and critical international scholarship across diverse realms on inquiry under two, interlinked, themes: (i) governance and institutional responses and (ii) vulnerabilities and inequalities. The contributors offer a forceful reminder that when considering climate change, social justice principles cannot be appended after the fact. Climate change adaptation and mitigation pose complex and interdependent social and ethical dilemmas that will need to be explicitly confronted in any activation of Green New Deal strategies currently being developed internationally.

In this paper, I examine how the ecological civilization project has become a key driver of change in extractive regions, constituting new eco-politics of extractive governance that can be characterized by heightened authoritarian environmentalism, with the Central Environmental Inspection Team as a particularly important mechanism through which the centralization of environmental governance is achieved. I argue that the ambitious environmental goals of an ecological civilization are achieved by sacrificing the interests of extractive communities. As these vulnerable communities are highly dependent on their extractive industries and often face significant diversification difficulties, the eco-civilization project has devastating local socioeconomic impacts and are likely to accelerate structural decline and population shrinkage if not promptly addressed through external support. I argue that this constitutes a form of environmental injustice, where environmental policies impose unfair burdens on disadvantaged individuals and communities. In particular, extractive communities bear the greatest burden of both environmental exploitation and environmental protection. Achieving socially just environmental sustainability should be an important aspect of ecological civilization.","[Lo, Kevin] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lo, K (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lokevin@hkbu.edu.hk,,"Lo, Kevin/0000-0001-7721-4726",General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [12600718],This work was supported by the General Research Fund (12600718) of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong.,,72,4,4,8,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2214-790X,2214-7918,,EXTRACT IND SOC,Extr.

Over the past decade, the scientific, legal, and policy communities have grown increasingly concerned with the question of accountability for the social losses and damages (L&D) stemming from climate change, evidenced by the development of the scientific attribution research field, legal cases against fossil fuel companies, and negotiations for L&D continuing at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As these sectors converge, however, there are some serious conceptual, and related ethical, issues regarding accountability and attribution including which communities are included in attribution studies and lawsuits, which emitters are considered in policy and law, and whether and how finance transfer is included. This article reviews the dominant spheres of L&D studies and mechanisms and explore what an accountability-based approach rooted in theories of climate justice has to bear on the broader conversation. Here, some of the challenges are explored in determining accountability and finance transfer, including potential pitfalls which may inadvertently lead to injustices in such an approach. Finally, a process for operationalizing the accountability-based approach is presented, which may help circumvent some of the challenges.","[Williams, Emily] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, 4815 Ellison, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Williams, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, 4815 Ellison, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",ewilliams@ucsb.edu,,"Williams, Emily/0000-0002-7261-3071",,,,49,0,0,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, the claims underpinning the engagement of this Indigenous and forest peoples' network in international climate finance processes reflect conceptualizations of climate justice that diverge from those that have dominated policy and popular discussions. This article assesses the multi-scalar efforts of the Mesoamerican Alliance to promote claims to climate finance around different concepts of justice. Using empirical justice analysis to assess the subjects, dimensions, and criteria explicit and implicit in Mesoamerican Indigenous and forest groups' claims, and drawing on decolonial and Indigenous perspectives on environmental justice, the article presents evidence as to the possibilities and challenges of translating REDD+ into just outcomes in historically marginalized territories. Using participant observation, unstructured interviews, and document and social media review, it specifically assesses the Alliance-proposed Mesoamerican Territorial Fund, which aims to directly capture climate finance, bypassing problematic relations with national governments and traditional donors. The article finds that although Indigenous peoples and local communities have made significant advances in terms of representation, recognition, participation, and concrete funding, the constraints of becoming fundable may hinder more transformative and reparative pathways to just climate outcomes.","[Sauls, Laura Aileen] Coll Holy Cross, Environm Studies Program, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Sauls, Laura Aileen] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Sauls, LA (corresponding author), Coll Holy Cross, Environm Studies Program, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.; Sauls, LA (corresponding author), Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",lsauls@holycross.edu,,"Sauls, Laura/0000-0001-8868-7465",,,,65,1,1,3,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Because of a fragile universality, both Reformed churches and global institutions find it difficult to agree on a concrete plan to address climate change. Theologically, this difficulty arrives not primarily from disagreement with the existence or causes of climate change but how Christian theological values translate concretely to acts of justice. This study proposes a way to ground these discussions on the concept of dangerous memory by resourcing the theology of Johann Baptist Metz. Dangerous memories allow stories of the suffering vanquished to be constitutive to the construction ofcaritas,which in turn serves as a suitable theological foundation for addressing differing approaches to engaging climate issues. Reading the Accra Confession as dangerous memory, then, provides a valuable resource to the Reformed community by allowing the testimonies of those affected adversely by climate change to substantially inform theological discourses on climate justice.","[Kuo, Henry S.] Grad Theol Union, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA; [Kuo, Henry S.] First Chinese Presbyterian Church, New York, NY 10002 USA","Kuo, HS (corresponding author), Grad Theol Union, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA.; Kuo, HS (corresponding author), First Chinese Presbyterian Church, New York, NY 10002 USA.",hkuo@ses.gtu.edu,,"Kuo, Henry/0000-0003-1767-6958",,,,33,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,JUL,2020,11,7,,,,,,,320,10.3390/rel11070320,,,17,Religion,Religion,MT1GM,WOS:000554716800001,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-08-07,

Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured. The study utilizes a remote sensing approach to investigate the impacts of a period of over 30 years (1989-2019) in Brisbane, Australia and its adjoining local government areas. The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.","[Mortoja, Md Golam; Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia","Yigitcanlar, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",mdgolam.mortoja@hdr.qut.edu.au; tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au,"Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012","Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118",,,,82,8,8,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUL,2020,12,14,,,,,,,2270,10.3390/rs12142270,,,24,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,MS2FP,WOS:000554099200001,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-08-07,

Therefore, the financial burden of the costs of loss and damage must be distributed fairly and proportionally. This implies that those responsible for climate change must take responsibility and compensate those who suffer losses and, if possible, repair the damages related to this phenomenon. However, climate justice has been limited by the lack of a causal link between a specific climate change effect and specific damages or losses. Accordingly, this article discusses the compensation and reparation of losses and damages related to the adverse effects of climate change, as a stream applicable after mitigation and adaptation policies. In addition, this article reviews the implications of the relevant findings that established the existence and development of climate change as a problem that affects the enjoyment of human rights, to argue how the theory of human rights can contribute to the current legal model for reparation and compensation for losses and damages associated with climate change. Also, due to the impossibility of obtaining a legally binding agreement as a structure for integration, and to adequately address the problem of causes, consequences, benefits and burdens, vulnerable groups ought to be the most affected.","[Garcia, Jorge Gabriel Arevalo] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Walther Schucking Inst Int Law, Kiel, Germany","Garcia, JGA (corresponding author), Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Walther Schucking Inst Int Law, Kiel, Germany.",arevalo.garcia.jg@gmail.com,,,,,,42,0,0,0,2,"UNIV NAC AUTONOMA MEXICO, INST INVESTIGACIONES JURIDICAS",MEXICO CITY,"CIRCUITO MARIO CUEVA S-N, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO CITY, 04510, MEXICO",1870-0578,,,MEX LAW REV,Mex.

Using a systematic evaluation of academic publications in the field, we argue that the current moment of research has been shaped by two recent waves of thought. The first, a wave ofurban optimism, which started in 2011 and peaked in 2013, engaged with urban areas as alternative sites for governance in the face of the crumbling international climate regime. The second, a wave ofurban pragmatism, which started in 2016, has sought to reimagine urban areas following the integration of the sub-national as a meaningful category in the international climate regime after the 2015 Paris Agreement for Climate Action. Four themes dominate the debate on climate change governance in urban areas: why there is climate action, how climate action is delivered, how it is articulated in relation to internationally reaching networks, and what implications it has to understand environmental or climate justice within urban settings. Calls to understand the impacts of climate change policy have fostered research on climate change politics, issues of power and control, conflicts, and the inherently unjust nature of much climate policy. What is largely missing from the current scholarship is a sober assessment of the mundane aspects of climate change governance on the ground and a concern with what kind of cultural and socio-economic change is taking place, beyond comparative analyses of the effectiveness of climate policies.

Vanuatu made headlines when its Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and External Trade, the Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, announced his government's intention to explore legal action as a tool to address climate loss and damage suffered in Vanuatu. Our contribution places this announcement in the context of Vanuatu's own experience with climate loss and damage, and the state's ongoing efforts to secure compensation for loss and damage through the multilateral climate change regime. We then discuss the possibilities for legal action to seek redress for climate loss and damage, focusing on two types of action highlighted in Minister Regenvanu's statement: action against states under international law, and action against fossil fuel companies under domestic law. After concluding that the issue of compensation for climate loss and damage is best addressed at the multilateral level, we offer proposals on how the two processes of litigation and negotiation could interact with each other and inspire more far-reaching action to address loss and damage from climate change. Key policy insights The review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage offers an opportunity to start putting in place a facility for loss and damage finance under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A climate damages tax (CDT) on fossil fuel companies seems a particularly promising option for mobilizing loss and damage finance. Such a CDT could be one revenue stream for a relevant loss and damage facility. Legal action - including cases against foreign states or fossil fuel companies - could bolster the position of climate-vulnerable states in multilateral negotiations on loss and damage finance.","[Wewerinke-Singh, Margaretha] Grotius Ctr Int Legal Studies, Leiden, Netherlands; [Wewerinke-Singh, Margaretha; Salili, Diana Hinge] Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji","Wewerinke-Singh, M (corresponding author), Steenschuur 25, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands.",m.j.wewerinke@law.leidenuniv.nl,,"Wewerinke-Singh, Margaretha/0000-0002-7782-1857",,,,71,7,7,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The rebuilding of tourism infrastructure has often been one of the main aims of international development aid and regional government responses to natural disasters. This article seeks to identify other ways in which Caribbean small island states and non-independent territories might rebuild more sustainable ecologies and economies as they come out of the pandemic within the ongoing climate crisis. The first part shows the historical grounding of climate change vulnerability in colonial histories, neoliberal capitalism and ongoing practices of extractive tourism. This analysis of the coloniality of climate centers on a critique of disaster tourism during these unnatural disasters, and allows for re-framing the ethical and political implications of tourism recovery when other human im/mobilities (such as migration) are severely curtailed. The article then elaborates on the theoretical concept of mobility justice as a way to think through the problem of sustainability transitions in relation to tourism mobilities, climate change and disaster recovery. The final section considers alternative visions for disaster reconstruction in the Caribbean centering food sovereignty, agroecology and regenerative economies, as promoted by community-based organizations and people's assemblies.","[Sheller, Mimi] Drexel Univ, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Sheller, M (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mimi.sheller@drexel.edu,"Sheller, Mimi/ABC-5466-2020; , Polly/AAX-2742-2020",,,,,104,10,11,10,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Impacts from climate change should be understood as incremental violence structurally over-determined by international relations of power and control that affect most acutely those who contributed least to dangerous levels of anthropocentric greenhouse gas emissions. Calls for compensation or reparation for 'loss and damage' are therefore a demand for climate justice. This article shows how questions of loss and damage were initially avoided within the climate regime. At the nineteenth Conference of the Parties in December 2013 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted the Warsaw International Mechanisms for Loss and Damage (WIM) associated with climate change. However, even then questions of compensative or reparative justice were persistently evaded. The institutionalisation of the WIM focused on questions of comprehensive risk assessment and disaster risk reduction and the promotion of privatised, insurance-based and financialised approaches to financing loss and damage. These operate in different ways to displace responsibility away from historical polluters, by nationalising responsibility to anticipate and prepare for disasters and seeking to responsibilise the vulnerable and risk-exposed subject.","[Dehm, Julia] La Trobe Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Dehm, J (corresponding author), La Trobe Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",j.dehm@latrobe.edu.au,,"Dehm, Julia/0000-0001-9495-6705",,,,136,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1038-3441,1839-4205,,GRIFFITH LAW REV,Griffith Law Rev.,APR 2,2020,29,2,,,,,220,252,,10.1080/10383441.2020.1790101,,JUL 2020,33,Law,Government & Law,SW2DX,WOS:000548992300001,,,,,2021-08-07,

In so doing, we first situate corporate activism in relation to the more established fields of political corporate social responsibility and corporate social responsibility communication, focusing on discussions concerning the interplay between talk and action as well as the potential of talk to lead to action. On this basis, we propose a conceptual framework that posits talk and action as operating conjointly on the ontological plane of s(t)imulation, a conceptual conjunction of simulation and stimulation that is inspired by Baudrillard's notion of the simulacrum. Empirically, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 20 examples of corporate advertising that has been reported as anti-Trump in the media. We find that the advertising in our sample is characterized by the following three main distinctions: (1) humorous references to Trump, (2) favourable and highly emotional appeals to social justice and (3) dystopian visions of society. We argue that a postmodern perspective on signs and representation may not only nuance our understanding of corporate activism, but also contribute to the conceptualization of the phenomenon by pushing the explanatory framework beyond the dialectic of talk and action.","[Gulbrandsen, Ib T.] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Digital Media Lab, Roskilde, Denmark; [Just, Sine N.] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Strateg Commun, Roskilde, Denmark; [Uldam, Julie] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Frederiksberg, Denmark","Gulbrandsen, IT (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",ibtunby@ruc.dk,,"Uldam, Julie/0000-0003-2048-5933; Norholm Just, Sine/0000-0002-4179-2708",,,,99,0,0,3,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,,,,,,,,,,,1.35051E+15,10.1177/1350508420939225,,JUL 2020,23,Management,Business & Economics,MN9TP,WOS:000551182300001,,,,,2021-08-07,

Surely, they often overcome multiple challenges, including natural hazards exacerbated by climate change. Yet their actions are increasingly examined through the framework of resilience, a notion developed in the North, and increasingly adopted in the South. To what extent eliminate' do these initiatives correspond to the concepts that scholars and authorities place under the resilience framework? Design/methodology/approach Three longitudinal case studies in Yumbo, Salgar and San Andres (Colombia) serve to investigate narratives of disaster risks and responses to them. Methods include narrative analysis from policy and project documents, presentations, five workshops, six focus groups and 24 interviews. Findings The discourse adopted by most international scholars and local authorities differs greatly from that used by citizens to explain risk and masks the politics involved in disaster reduction and the search for social justice. Besides, narratives of social change, aspirations and social status are increasingly masked in disaster risk explanations. Tensions are also concealed, including those regarding the winners and losers of interventions and the responsibilities for disaster risk reduction. Originality/value Our findings confirm previous results that have shown that the resilience framework contributes to depoliticize the analysis of risk and serves to mask and dilute the responsibility of political and economic elites in disaster risk creation. But they also show that resilience fails to explain the type of socioeconomic change that is required to reduce vulnerabilities in Latin America.","[Lizarralde, Gonzalo; Herazo, Benjamin] Univ Montreal, Sch Architecture, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Paez, Holmes] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia; [Lopez, Adriana; Lopez, Oswaldo] Univ Valle, Cali, Colombia; [Bornstein, Lisa] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gould, Kevin] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Munoz, Lissette] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia","Lizarralde, G (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Sch Architecture, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",gonzalo.lizarralde@umontreal.ca; paez.holmes@javeriana.edu.co; adriana.lopez@correounivalle.edu.co; oswaldo.lopez@correounivalle.edu.co; lisa.bornstein@mcgill.ca; kevin.gould@concordia.ca; bj.herazo.cueto@umontreal.ca; lissette_munoz@cun.edu.co,,"Paez Martinez, Holmes Julian/0000-0002-6964-9073; Lopez-Valencia, Adriana Patricia/0000-0003-1857-7580; Herazo, Benjamin/0000-0001-8605-8147",Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [108501]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR; Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQSC),"This research was supported by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Grant #108501.

In Europe and North America, research on the impacts of climate change on heritage, including how to mitigate against more frequent extreme weather events and how to implement efficient sustainable adaptation planning, are now key foci of heritage literature. In contrast, virtually nothing has been written about the impacts of climate change on heritage on the African continent, even though these will be significant in the coming decades. Heritage is essential for livelihoods, but also for the construction and reinforcement of identity and the psychological wellbeing of society. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on different (connected) forms of heritage in Africa, including archaeological, historical and living heritage. We situate the implications of climate change for African heritage in recent debates around climate justice, sustainability and social wellbeing. We conclude that without significant intervention some of Africa's most important heritage will be lost as a result of the direct and indirect impacts of climate change over the coming decades. Our intention is to draw attention to the need for research into the impacts of climate change on different forms of heritage in Africa and to highlight the possible deleterious effects these losses will have on society more generally.

We use industrial discharges into surface waters data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database. We employ runoffs normalized using previous 61-year average runoffs as a proxy for drought. We match both the discharges into surface waters and the runoffs at the 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) level. Our analysis indicates that normalized runoffs of the current and previous years positively influence industrial emissions into surface waters. We also find that the impact of uneven availability of water on emissions is higher on larger facilities. Normalized runoffs of the current and previous years do not have a statistically significant influence on transfers to publicly owned treatment works.

We identify actionable leverage points through which youth-organizers might increase their social power in the COP process to bring about climate action.

Diverse alternative discourses challenge its dominance. This paper reviews alternative discourses to surface discursive common ground and conflicts, arguing that this is an important step towards the formation of discourse coalitions that could rival the political power of neoliberal capitalism. There is common ground in how alternative discourses see the world (systems and networks), their normative relationship with nature (sustainable, regenerative or planetcentric) and with each other (cooperative and entangled), their goals (wellbeing, justice and plurality) and some of the strategies for transformation (participatory governance, a new economic system, prioritizing different human values and participatory knowledge practices). There are also important conflicts that could offer productive sites for agonistic dialogue between plural discourses. These common and conflicting memes may be seeds of the discursive transformation that is essential to support flourishing, sustainable futures.","[Riedy, Chris] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia","Riedy, C (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",criedy@uts.edu.au,,,,,,87,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

There are elements of truth in both categorical statements. Yet neither is completely true. Indigenous vulnerability and resilience, and Indigenous groups' adaptive responses to climate change, need to be understood in the messy contexts of lived experience, rather than either elegant social theories or didactic ideological politics. Climate change action and research needs to acknowledge and engage with the knowledges, ontologies and experiences of diverse Indigenous groups, along with the specific histories, geographies and impacts of colonization, and their consequences for both the colonized and colonizers. Climate change action and research needs to be integrated into wider de-colonial projects as the transformative impacts of anthropogenic climate change are inadequately addressed within both colonial and post-colonial frames. Negotiating respectful modes of belonging-together-in-Country to reshape people-to-people, people-to-environment and people-to-cosmos relationships in Indigenous domains is essential in responding to planetary scale changes in coupled human and natural systems. This paper outlines an approach that nurtures Indigenous self-determination and inter-generational healing to rethink the geopolitics of Indigenous resilience, vulnerability and adaptation in an era of climate change and the resurgence of Great Power geopolitics.","[Howitt, Richard] Macquarie Univ, Dept Human Geog, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Howitt, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Human Geog, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",richie.howitt@mq.edu.au,"Howitt, Richard/E-2481-2011","Howitt, Richard/0000-0003-3769-4678","Research Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences, Ministry of Science and Technology","This research received no external funding.

In the United States, the extent to which Indigenous voices are heard-let alone incorporated into decision-making-depends heavily on whether or not Native nations are recognized by the federal government. In the southeastern United States, non-federally recognized Indigenous peoples continue to occupy their homelands along rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. These peoples, and the Tribal governments that represent them, rarely enter environmental decision-making spaces as sovereign nations and experts in their own right. Nevertheless, plans to construct the Atlantic Coast Pipeline prompted non-federally recognized Tribes to demand treatment as Tribal nations during permitting. Actions by the Tribes, which are recognized by the state of North Carolina, expose barriers to participation in environmental governance faced by Indigenous peoples throughout the United States, and particularly daunting challenges faced by state-recognized Tribes. After reviewing the legal and political landscapes that Native nations in the United States must navigate, we present a case study focused on Atlantic Coast Pipeline planning and permitting. We deliberately center Native voices and perspectives, often overlooked in non-Indigenous narratives, to emphasize Indigenous actions and illuminate participatory barriers. Although the Atlantic Coast Pipeline was cancelled in 2020, the case study reveals four enduring barriers to Tribal participation: adherence to minimum standards, power asymmetries, procedural narrowing, and color-blind planning. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for federal and state governments, developers, and Indigenous peoples to breach these barriers.","[Emanuel, Ryan E.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Campus Box 8008, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Wilkins, David E.] Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, 410 Westhampton Way, Richmond, VA 23173 USA","Emanuel, RE (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Campus Box 8008, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ryan_emanuel@ncsu.edu; dwilkins@richmond.edu,"Emanuel, Ryan E/C-3796-2012","Emanuel, Ryan E/0000-0002-2166-1698",University Faculty Scholars program at NC State; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [HRD 1461441],"This work was funded partly by the University Faculty Scholars program at NC State.

It is expected that this issue may significantly be improved by deploying the Justice-based allocation of carbon budget between countries. Aside from this budget, the remaining budget is limited by mitigation scenarios. In recent decades, some egalitarian, responsibility-based, right-based and capability-based approaches have been presented for carbon budget sharing, which in this study, some of their major deficiencies have been listed. These deficiencies help the politics and business having a stronger hand in international decision-making processes. Then, as a pure Justice-based effort for global carbon budget sharing, the extent to which countries have achieved sustainable development goals has been considered as the only yardstick for differences among the peoples in the world. It is noted that the costs imposed on countries have implicitly been considered. A statistical methodology based on the proximity to development levels of countries has been used, with countries being stratified into the Developed and the Developing. Furthermore, taking into account these strata and Climate Action of each country, in this article the Rawlsian theory of Justice has been applied to allocate carbon budget among countries. As a result, the fair carbon budget share (FCB) model has been introduced as a dynamic and forward-looking mechanism for determining the annual share of countries of the global carbon budget. The fair share of countries, resulting from the FCB model, has been calculated based upon the available statistical data. The results have shown significant differences between actual carbon emissions of countries and their fair share for years 2017 and 2018. Moreover, for comparison purposes, the FCB-derived shares had a significant difference with the shares provided by the egalitarian approach. Furthermore, as expected, it was observed that the FCB model does not provide a predetermined and foreseeable trend for countries' shares. This removes the biasedness criticism (commonly shared in all other approaches) for FCB model. Without any adjustment to the FCB model, the fair share of 2017 showed a significant balance between countries in debt or in credit when compared with their actual greenhouse gas emissions, which is indicative of the FCB's readiness to enter a market mechanism.","[Jabbari, Mehdi; Motlagh, Majid Shafiepour; Ashrafi, Khosro] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Environm, Dept Environm Engn, Qods St,Enghelab Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Abdoli, Ghahreman] Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, Tehran, Iran","Motlagh, MS (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Environm, Dept Environm Engn, Qods St,Enghelab Ave, Tehran, Iran.",shafiepour@ut.ac.ir,"Ashrafi, Khosro/U-2412-2018","Ashrafi, Khosro/0000-0001-8048-0275",,,,44,2,2,4,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The study investigates four themes: the disciplines, terminologies, definitions, and case studies and their interconnections and covers all relevant English-language sources since 1992 through 2018. The results reveal three findings with implications for future research: 1) there is a dearth in studies that tackle crucial contemporary challenges like climate change and studies that delve into the complex connections among the sociocultural, physical planning, environmental, and economic dimensions of stream daylighting, such as socio-environmental justice, architecture, and urban design; 2) the terminology is inconsistent and a clear definition is absent; 3) Some important stream daylighting cases are overlooked, such as Ziirich's (Switzerland) city-wide initiative and Riyadh's (Saudi Arabia) first arid climate initiative.

This paper reverses that causal arrow and presents an exploratory large-Nstudy of 187 countries from 1962 to 2009 assessing the long-term impact of violent conflicts on their environment. I also look at how this relationship is affected by economic and political factors. I use national biocapacity data calculated by the Global Footprint Network as a measure of environmental resources. The results indicate that in the long run, the impact of conflicts on a country's biocapacity is mediated by wealth and democratization. I find that both wealth and democratization are necessary to mitigate the environmental impact of wars. I also find that countries with high levels of democratization and low per capita GDP and countries with low levels of democratization and high per capita GDP experience a decline in their biocapacity in the long run as the intensity of conflict increases. These findings underscore how advanced, industrialized democracies export the environmental risk of wars onto other countries, which has implications for environmental security and international environmental justice.","[Pathak, Swapna] Oberlin Coll, 122 Elm St, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA","Pathak, S (corresponding author), Oberlin Coll, 122 Elm St, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA.",swapna.pathak@oberlin.edu,,,,,,62,0,0,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The intervention is constructed in four steps. First, it speaks to what kind of Urban Political Ecology (UPE)-or generally what I call a spatialized political ecology-may be appropriate for urban society. In a second step, it historicizes and spatializes the narrative by introducing an urban political ecology of landscapes. For that, the paper mobilizes the concepts of boundaries, belts, and in-betweens. The third part illustrates the transformation of postsuburban political ecologies in three rather different world regions. The last part of this paper examines what the potential is and what need for action exists in an urban society threatened and conditioned by the climate emergency and the Capitalocene.

The results indicate that alternative food networks can improve access to healthy food, provide fairer conditions for farmers, reduce food loss/waste, increase environmental protection, and facilitate climate change adaptation. The limitations to the expansion of alternative food networks are also discussed, including the restricted access to land for growing food, low public engagement, and the dependence on volunteer labor. The paper concludes by summarizing the contribution of alternative food networks to urban food systems and identifies issues for future research.","[Vieira, Leticia Canal; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Univ Waikato, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Howes, Michael] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Cities Res Inst, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia","Vieira, LC (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",leticiacvieira@gmail.com,,"Serrao-Neumann, Silvia/0000-0001-9601-4914; Howes, Michael/0000-0003-1102-1483",GUIPRS Scholarship scheme; Griffith University [GUIPRS Scholarship],"This research is part of Leticia Canal Vieira's PhD, funded by the GUIPRS Scholarship scheme; Griffith University [GUIPRS Scholarship].",,79,2,2,8,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2168-3565,2168-3573,,AGROECOL SUST FOOD,Agroecol.

This systematic review analyses the application of biocultural approaches to sustainability in scientific journal articles published between 1990 and 2018 through a mixed methods approach combining qualitative content analysis and quantitative multivariate methods. The study identifies seven distinct biocultural lenses, that is, different ways of understanding and applying biocultural approaches, which to different degrees consider the key aspects of sustainability science-inter- and transdisciplinarity, social justice and normativity. The review suggests that biocultural approaches in sustainability science need to move from describing how nature and culture are co-produced to co-producing knowledge for sustainability solutions, and in so doing, better account for questions of power, gender and transformations, which has been largely neglected thus far.

How will climate change, one of, if not the most pressing issue of our times be tackled on a global scale? With these questions in mind, this article invites the reader to perform a thought experiment into the future. Following an imagined snapshot of the year 2040, the reader is guided through major global developments regarding climate change, social movements and, eventually, climate justice from the 2020s to 2040s. By imagining social, political and economic consequences of climate change and responses to them, this article paints a picture of what the future could look like if climate justice became a guiding principle in the struggle of mitigating the effects of climate change. Suggesting a paradigm shift from securitizing climate change to securing climate justice, this 'future' calls for a discursive turn of the manner in which climate change is thought of and acted upon. It requires different entities, including academia, to recognize their role as political actors within society. Consequently, it is crucial to reflect upon whose security is (not) considered but also which responses are taken into account in what way to mitigate security risks related to climate change. The article concludes that imagining a future of climate justice is pivotal to finding solutions to the challenges we are confronted with, that is, keeping the metaphoric ship from crashing into the cliffs.","[Standke-Erdmann, Madita] Univ Vienna, FWF Funded Project GBV MIG, Vienna, Austria; [Viehoff, Alina] Univ Hamburg IFSH, Inst Peace Res & Secur Policy, Hamburg, Germany","Standke-Erdmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",madita.erdmann@univie.ac.at,,"Standke-Erdmann, Madita/0000-0001-7472-515X",project on Arms Control and Emerging Technologies - German Federal Foreign Office,"This article stemmed from a workshop at the Hamburg (Insecurity) Sessions, a conference conceived and organized by Benjamin Tallis (who edits New Perspectives) for the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg (IFSH).

Investigating Indigenous political ecologies from the colonial archives of New France recovers the ways Native women maintained sovereign communities in their riverine homelands in an era of climate change, colonial invasion, and internecine violence during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Placing Indigenous women, their kinship networks, and their relationship with their ancestral lands at the center of decolonial history shows how Native communities along Kaniatarowanenneh-the St. Lawrence River-represented sites of Native resilience and regeneration rather than decline and dependence. Native women established a syncretistic religion devoted to Kateri's memory that mapped Catholic rituals on traditional Indigenous ecological knowledge and practices. This Indigenous spirituality remained distinct from the devotional cult European American colonizers erected around Kateri, and it persisted after settlers forgot her. After more than three centuries, Kateri's bones remain at Kahnawa:ke Mohawk Territory as a testimony to an unbroken history of Indigenous power, presence, and care for the land. Contemporary Indigenous movements for sovereignty, self-determination, and environmental justice have their origins in the political ecology of healing embodied by Kateri's bones.","[Mortimer, Loren Michael] Univ Calif Davis, Hist Dept, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Mortimer, LM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Hist Dept, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,82,0,0,1,1,UNIV MINNESOTA PRESS,MINNEAPOLIS,"MILL PLACE, SUITE 290 111 THIRD AVE S, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55401-2520 USA",2332-1261,,,NAIS-NATIV AM INDIG,NAIS-Nativ.

Nevertheless, humans are not equitably responsible for environmental damage, for the depletion and contamination of ecosystems are not the result of the life style of the large majority of humans; in this sense, it is imperative to address the issue in economic terms of a Capitalocene, rather than an Anthropocene. This research implements deductive methodology with exploratory emphasis to investigate the ways in which environmental protection strategies are followed by a legal structure that authorizes the use, the appropriation and the management of nature's values; ultimately, one expects a change in overall behaviour. In this scheme, it explores the concepts of ecology, natural environment and justice, as well as proposals that question dominant rationality, could entail social change strategies to erect a mode of production and the dominant logics. Political ecology, environmental knowledge and environmental justice are social constructions both in symbolic and material terms. These frameworks allow a new civilizational project of a shift in dominant rationality in which social sciences meet alterity.","[Gomes Marques da Cunha, Clarissa de Oliveira] Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Fac Damas Instrucao Crista FADIC, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Sandoval Vasquez, Francisco Ruben] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico UAEM, Toluca, Mexico; [Afonso, Henrique Weil] Fac Damas Instrucao Crista FADIC, Recife, PE, Brazil","da Cunha, CDGM (corresponding author), Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Fac Damas Instrucao Crista FADIC, Recife, PE, Brazil.",marquesc2504@gmail.com; sandovaz@hotmail.com; henriqueweil@faculdadedamas.edu.br,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,ESCOLA SUPERIOR DOM HELDER CAMARA,BELO HORIZONTE,"RUA ALVARES MACIEL 628, STA EFIGENIA, BELO HORIZONTE, MG 30150-250, BRAZIL",1806-3845,2179-8699,,VEREDAS DIREITO,Veredas Direito,SEP-DEC,2020,17,39,,,,,99,121,,10.18623/rvd.v17i39.1917,,,23,Law,Government & Law,PT9HU,WOS:000608921800005,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

I access longitudinal data for Singapore, a newly affluent Asian city-nation and arguably a harbinger of what is to come in the urbanizing tropics. Singapore today combines high (yet unequal) defensive capital stocks, such as residential air conditioning, with widely varying particle pollution. Overall, residential electricity demand grows by 1.1% when PM2.5 rises by 10 mu g/m(3). I compare the pollution-electricity response to the well-known heat-electricity response, and show how it varies over the socioeconomic distribution. Local pollution control has the cobenefit of reducing electricity generation, via lower household demand, and thus mitigating carbon emissions. The observed inequality in defensive expenditure may also exacerbate health inequalities, as suggested by an exchange between epidemiologists and government.","[Salvo, Alberto] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore","Salvo, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",albertosalvo@nus.edu.sg,,,"Singapore's Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1Ministry of Education, Singapore [R-122-000-235-112]","University of California Davis, University of California Santa Barbara, and World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists, including Dave Keiser, Lala Ma, Celine Nauges, Dimitri Szerman, and Cheng Xu.

In this study, we examined sociodemographic differences in access to green spaces of different sizes for 14,385 census block groups in 12 U.S. cities using a 'just sustainabilities' framework. We classified green spaces into street-level greenery (XS), neighborhood parks (S-L; walking and cycling access), and large parks (XL; walking, cycling, and driving access). We ran spatial filtering models at the census block group level using different thresholds based on transportation modes. We uncovered a complex picture of inequality, with consistent injustices for XS green space, and fewer injustices for S-L and XL green space based on socioeconomic status and age, and some instances of just distributions for S-L and XL green space based on race/ethnicity. Our findings present a concerning picture for 'just sustainabilities': the green space type that is most often part of sustainability and climate adaptation strategies-street greenery-is unjustly distributed, likely as a result of structural racism in U.S. institutions.

Given increasing global interest in the potential for urban greenspace to contribute to resilience in the face of environmental change and the higher vulnerability of Asian cities to environmental shocks, this is a notable gap. In response, this paper evaluates the contours of environmental justice debates within urban greenspace planning for one subtropical Asian city-Taipei. Through analysis of newspaper reporting on urban greenspace planning within Taipei, the potential and limitations of greenspace planning in contributing to equitably delivering benefits from urban greenspace towards resilience are assessed. Findings suggest that claims to environmental injustice in greenspace debates within Taipei follow broadly similar lines to controversies in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, the need for specific knowledge to understand the different ecosystem services provided by tropical zone ecosystems, and the potential for conflicts over greenspace versus development to be heightened in dense Asian city settings, are highlighted as potential areas where environmental justice debates in an Asian urban greening context may differ from Western cities.","[Mabon, Leslie] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland","Mabon, L (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland.",leslie.mabon@sams.ac.uk,,"Mabon, Leslie/0000-0003-2646-6119",,,,62,3,3,4,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0129-7619,1467-9493,,SINGAPORE J TROP GEO,Singap.

Low socioeconomic status and limited political power means that migrants suffer from reduced visibility and legitimacy, which increases poverty and economic degradation. Climate migration lacks a comprehensive and universally accepted name or status. Current policies focus on post-impact scenarios and do little to address structural flaws or humanitarian issues associated with state-aid practices. This article asks what role can be played for and by climate-displaced populations. It answers this by looking at climate-induced circular migration in coastal regions of the Global South. It explores spatial planning and governance best practices, seeing them as tools to adapt climate-induced migration to benefit both sending and receiving regions, as well as the migrants themselves. It advocates a pre-emptive regional approach, highlighting the role that traditional knowledge can play in helping people regenerate livelihoods and increase climate resilience by incorporating traditional knowledge into economic and spatial plans. This can contribute to conservation, and strengthen local ownership of identity and culture, which, in turn, can aid rural development strategies at a regional level. The article builds on existing literature, sees migrants as a source of traditional knowledge, and proposes a three-part framework. Define - Include - Recognize addresses climate-induced migration by providing a universal definition for the environmentally displaced; includes environmental migration in national and local spatial planning policy instruments; and stresses the need for community-based strategies and pre-emptive planning to make concrete proposals for the material improvement of migrants' lives.","[Das Sharma, Asmeeta] 56 Munirka Vihar, New Delhi 110067, India","Das Sharma, A (corresponding author), 56 Munirka Vihar, New Delhi 110067, India.",asmeeta_das@hotmail.com,,"Bracken, Gregory/0000-0002-7382-1534",,,,26,0,0,4,7,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

We estimated long-term, present-day and future exposure to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across Alaska for the general population and subpopulations to assess vulnerability using observed data for the present day (1997-2010), modelled estimates for the present day (1997-2001), and modelled estimates for the future (2047-2051). First, we assessed wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure by estimating monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels across 1997-2010 for 158 Alaskan census tracts, using atmospheric transport modelling based on observed area-burned data. Second, we estimated changes in future (2047-2051) wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure compared to the present-day (1997-2001) by estimating the monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels for 29 boroughs/census areas (county-equivalent areas), under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario from an ensemble of 13 climate models. Subpopulation risks for present and future exposure levels were estimated by summing area-weighted exposure levels utilizing the 2000 Census and State of Alaska's population projections. We assessed vulnerability by several subpopulation characteristics (e.g. race/ethnicity, urbanicity). Wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure levels during 1997-2010 were highest in interior Alaska during July. Among subpopulations, average summer (June-August) exposure levels for urban dwellers and African-American/Blacks were highest at 9.1 mu g m(-3)and 10 mu g m(-3), respectively.

Estimates indicate that by the mid-21st century, under climate change, almost all of Alaska could be exposed to increases of 100% or more in levels of wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels. Exposure to wildfire-PM(2.5)likely presents a substantial public health burden in the present day for Alaska communities, with different impacts by subpopulation.

Pursuing energy transition through supply-side constraints would have major geopolitical and economic consequences. Depending on the criteria and instruments applied, supply cuts for fossil fuels could drastically reduce and reorient major financial flows and reshape the spatiality of energy production and consumption. Building on debates about just transitions and supply constraints, we provide a survey of emerging interventions targeting the supply of, rather than the demand for, fossil fuels. We articulate four theories of justice and criteria to prioritize cuts among fossil fuel producers, including with regard to carbon intensity, production costs, affordability, developmental efficiency and support for climate change action. We then examine seven major supply constraint instruments, their effectiveness and possible pathways to supply cuts in the coal, oil and gas sectors. We suggest that supply cuts both reflect and offer purposeful political spaces of interventions towards a 'just' transition away from fossil fuel production.","[Le Billon, Philippe] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Kristoffersen, Berit] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Social Sci, Tromso, Norway","Le Billon, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",lebillon@geog.ubc.ca,,,,,,104,21,21,25,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

To address that question, this overview reflects on the diverse and complementary ways that archaeology has advanced our understanding of sustainable agriculture. Here, I assess recent archaeological research through the lens of the five principles of sustainable agriculture used by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. These principles-efficiency, conservation, rural livelihoods, resilience, and governance-highlight the social and environmental dimensions of agricultural sustainability. By drawing on case studies from around the world, I show how archaeology is uniquely situated to examine the interactions of these social and environmental dimensions over long periods of time. Archaeology's strongest conceptual contributions to sustainable agriculture are (1) its capacity to demonstrate that sustainability is historically contingent and (2) its attention to outcomes. If transformed into meaningful action, these contributions have the potential to advance modern agricultural sustainability and environmental justice initiatives. This overview is an invitation to clarify a plan for future research and outreach. It is an invitation to imagine what an archaeology for sustainable agriculture will look like and what it will accomplish.","[Fisher, Chelsea] Washington & Lee Univ, Environm Studies Program, Tucker Hall 018, Lexington, VA 24450 USA","Fisher, C (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Environm Studies Program, Tucker Hall 018, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",cfisher@wlu.edu,,,Mischa Titiev Fellowship from the University of Michigan Department of Anthropology,"I thank Joyce Marcus for her sustained support during the preparation of this manuscript.

Because of the large uncertainties in the effects of climate change and the subjectivity of the discount rate, estimates of SCC range widely, from - 10.2 to 105 213$ t(-1)in 2010 USD. Despite this range, the SCC has been used or proposed as a basis for a wide variety of policymaking including cost-benefit analysis and carbon taxes. The SCC suffers from several practical and philosophical weaknesses: it is anthropocentric, it neglects the acidification of oceans, it assumes that quantifiable economic variables like GDP are the primary costs that humans will experience from climate change, and it is impossible to quantify objectively. Further, the ethical implications of a carbon pricing policy include both the value of the carbon price, and the use of revenues generated by the policy. Thus, revenue neutral carbon policies as in some SCC-based proposals, are unlikely to be just. Here, we propose that the cost of emerging negative-emission technologies would be an alternative means for setting a carbon price and avoid these philosophical and practical weaknesses.","[Snyder, Brian F.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Snyder, BF (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",Snyderb@lsu.edu,,,,,,60,1,1,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,1654-7209,,AMBIO,Ambio,SEP,2020,49,9,,,,,1567,1580,,10.1007/s13280-019-01301-y,,,14,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC7EE,WOS:000543444600009,31820259,,,,2021-08-07,

At the same time, the suburbanization of poverty and immigration are making the region increasingly - albeit unevenly - diverse. This paper synthesizes insights from planning and ecology to address the following questions: how do burned areas differ from the rest of the region in terms of poverty, race, and housing values; how has this changed since 1980; and what are the implications for environmental justice? Typically, low-income urban communities of color are disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts. However, this study finds that the wildland-adjacent neighborhoods most impacted by wildfire have remained predominantly white and affluent, even as Southern California has become increasingly diverse. Moreover, housing in burned areas is increasingly more expensive. These results indicate that home ownership in a fire-prone, wildland-adjacent neighborhood is a profitable investment for those who can afford it. This situation is likely creating perverse incentives for continued development of the wildland-urban interface, leading to both continued ecological disturbance and affluent residents continuing to subject themselves to more physical danger than they have acknowledged.","[Garrison, Jessica Debats] UC Irvine, Urban Planning & Publ Policy, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Huxman, Travis E.] UC Irvine, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA USA","Garrison, JD (corresponding author), UC Irvine, Urban Planning & Publ Policy, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jdgarris@uci.edu,,,,,,48,2,2,1,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,SEP,2020,104,,,,,,,,102725,10.1016/j.cities.2020.102725,,,8,Urban Studies,Urban Studies,LZ3TV,WOS:000541151900002,,,,,2021-08-07,

While the importance of just and equitable climate change adaptation is well understood, the policy and politics that underlie such efforts are less well understood. This paper focuses on the development of just climate change adaptation strategies in legacy cities, particularly those in the Great Lakes region of the U.S., where the challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation are particularly high. Detroit, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio are used as illustrative case studies. These cities are two of the only two legacy cities of the Great Lakes region to have developed formal and explicit adaptation plans, and foregrounded justice and equity early in the process. A review of planning documents, and interviews with key stakeholders, in the two cities are used to identify the components of justice being included in climate change adaptation planning, the drivers or motivations for foregrounding justice in their adaptation planning, and the policy tools being used or developed to reach these goals. The findings reveal an awareness among stakeholders and decision makers in both cities of the importance of addressing inequality in climate change adaptation, some attention to justice principles in the adaptation plans themselves, and a diverse set of policy tools emerging to support this work. Importantly, despite relatively modest ambitions for climate change adaptation, both cities face implementation challenges that are likely to be common among legacy cities of the region.","[Hughes, Sara] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Hughes, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hughessm@umich.edu,,"Hughes, Sara/0000-0002-1282-6235",,,,58,1,2,6,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The vulnerability of these regions is exacerbated by a lack of capital for adaptive measures against the impacts of climate change. The increasing transference of capital from governmental control to private hands, and the increasing concentration of such capital into the hands of fewer individuals raises further concerns about capacity to mitigate or adapt to climate change. In addition, conflicts arise regarding the choice of climate change solutions. Ironically, the people of the Fateful Ellipse, who are most vulnerable to climate change, produce the lowest amount of carbon per capita. As a result of the colonial enterprise, including slavery, they also paid a heavy price toward the economic ascendency of Europe and North America and the Industrial Revolution that fueled the rise in greenhouse gas production. The discipline of geography itself owes some measure of its development and ascendency to colonialism and the exploitation of the Fateful Ellipse.

To this end, the authors examined the program descriptions, learning outcomes and curricula of 84 graduate programs in sport management or closely related fields at 65 R1 universities in the United States. Using inductive thematic analysis, they identified seven themes that are shared across multiple program curricula. The seven themes were labeled: sport sociology and sport ethics; globalization and economic growth; sport for development and peace; health; climate, environment and sustainability; gender; and inequality, discrimination and social justice. The overall results indicate that the discipline has coalesced around a key set of skills and content areas. This standardization may come at the expense of adaptability and responsiveness to changes in sport and in society. Academic programs are generally unwilling to depart from a twentieth-century model of education built around a supposition that the sport manager's primary responsibilities are revenue generation and liability mitigation. As the unsustainability of late capitalism becomes increasingly difficult to ignore, students and educators will find it correspondingly complicated to reconcile the contradiction between sport-as-business-enterprise and the notion that sport itself can contribute to social or moral development. This long-standing compromising attitude and failure to acknowledge the need for wholesale change will only require much more disruptive and perhaps radical reform in the future. Faced with pressure from various stakeholders, many sport organizations employ sustainability units or departments. Although imperfect, these efforts often exceed those made by academic programs.","[Licen, Simon; Jedlicka, Scott R.] Washington State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership & Sport Management, POB 642136, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Licen, S (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership & Sport Management, POB 642136, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",simon.licen@wsu.edu,,"Licen, Simon/0000-0002-7261-7013",,,,54,0,0,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1357-3322,1470-1243,,SPORT EDUC SOC,Sport.

This characterization of disaster disallows analysis of racial violence and dispossession structurally instituted across multiple disasters. As a result, repeatedly poor pre-disaster and post-disaster planning is leveraged to displace and disenfranchise marginalized communities. With climate change, disasters are projected to become more intense and frequent, necessitating a serious inquiry into inequalities occurring across repeated disasters. This essay uses theories of colonialism and coloniality from Puerto Rico to examine how colonialism operates through repeated disaster, in this case hurricanes. Building off of research onenvironmentalcolonialism in Puerto Rico, the concept ofdisastercolonialism is proposed to explain how procedural vulnerability is deepened through disasters and subsequently leveraged to deepen coloniality. To illustrate the utility of this term, a brief overview of Puerto Rico's environmental history with hurricanes is examined through the lens of disaster colonialism. Ultimately, the commentary poses three questions to planners relative to the concept of disaster colonialism.","[Rivera, Danielle Zoe] Univ Colorado, 1060 18th St,ENVD 154, Boulder, CO 80304 USA","Rivera, DZ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, 1060 18th St,ENVD 154, Boulder, CO 80304 USA.",danielle.rivera@colorado.edu,,"Rivera, Danielle/0000-0003-1059-9291",,,,61,6,6,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-1317,1468-2427,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

This question is often framed through the language of distributive justice. Because of the inequitable distribution of historical emissions, climate vulnerability, and adaptation capacity, such considerations are necessary, but do not exhaust the question of responsibility. This article argues that climate change is a structural injustice demanding a theory of political responsibility. Agents bear responsibility not in virtue of their individual causal contribution or capacity, but because they participate in and benefit from the carbon-intensive structures, practices, and institutions that constitute the global political and economic system. Agents take responsibility by engaging in collective political action to transform these structures that generate both climate hazards and unjust relationships of power. By incorporating distributive principles within a capacious conception of political responsibility, this framework advances the theory and practice of climate justice in two ways. First, adopting a relational rather than individualistic criterion of responsibility better makes sense of how and why individuals bear responsibility for a global and intergenerational injustice like climate change. Second, framing climate justice in terms of political responsibility for unjust structural processes better orients and motivates the political action necessary for structural transformation.","[Sardo, Michael Christopher] Occidental Coll, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA","Sardo, MC (corresponding author), Occidental Coll, Polit Dept, M-22, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",msardo@oxy.edu,"Sardo, Michael Christopher/ABH-9871-2020","Sardo, Michael/0000-0003-0692-7264",,,,79,1,1,2,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1474-8851,1741-2730,,EUR J POLIT THEORY,Eur.

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.","[Schell, Christopher J.; Miller, Danica Sterud] Univ Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA; [Dyson, Karen; Fuentes, Tracy L.; Des Roches, Simone] Univ Washington, Coll Built Environm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dyson, Karen] Dendrolytics, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Des Roches, Simone] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fisheries Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Harris, Nyeema C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Appl Wildlife Ecol Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo A.] Univ Washington, Coll Environm, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lambert, Max R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Schell, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA.",cjschell@uw.edu,"Schell, Christopher/Q-9654-2017; Lambert, Max/B-3840-2015","Schell, Christopher/0000-0002-2073-9852; Harris, Nyeema/0000-0001-5174-2205; Dyson, K./0000-0002-8860-3396; Fuentes, Tracy/0000-0003-2238-2161; Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo/0000-0002-4363-237X; Lambert, Max/0000-0003-2318-6445; Des Roches, Simone/0000-0002-5360-8197","University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington; University of California, BerkeleyUniversity of California System; David H.

We argue that the mainstream approach to sustainability policy in most countries lies within capitalist market rationalities, thus making it crucial to study how such rationalities shape and represent the problems of unsustainability and how these problems limit the possibilities for politics and policy in practice. Furthermore, public procurement is a central instrument through which these rationalities are realised and maintained. Thus, the purpose is to examine how problems of unsustainability are represented through public procurement policy and the effects they constitute for the politics of sustainability. To this end we mobilise the Foucauldian based what's the problem represented to be approach. As data, we use policy documents published with respect to public procurement in Sweden. Our findings show that the dominant problem representation constructs unsustainability as a market failure, limiting the possibilities for politics and policies of sustainability in several ways. This includes premising sustainability upon the continued expansion of capitalism; constituting the agents of change as apolitical actors; making sustainability a voluntary ambition for the procuring organisations; and constructing the legitimate claim to earth's resources and sinks as a matter of purchasing power, with important implications for environmental justice. However, our analysis also shows a tension in the material creating openings for a politicisation of the representations of sustainability.","[Olsson, David; Ojehag-Pettersson, Andreas] Karlstad Univ, Dept Polit Hist Religious & Cultural Studies, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden","Olsson, D (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Polit Hist Religious & Cultural Studies, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",david.olsson@kau.se,,"Ojehag Pettersson, Andreas/0000-0003-4820-278X; Olsson, David/0000-0003-0745-2133","Myndigheten for Samhallsskydd och Beredskap [Societal Resilience in Sweden] [217-34]; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [ProcSIBE]Swedish Research Council Formas [2013-1837]","This work was supported by Myndigheten for Samhallsskydd och Beredskap [Societal Resilience in Sweden, grant number 217-34]; The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [ProcSIBE, grant number 2013-1837].",,81,1,1,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,SEP 1,2020,25,9,,,,,681,696,,10.1080/13549839.2020.1820471,,SEP 2020,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,NW3XT,WOS:000571289600001,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2021-08-07,

J,"Sokol, KC",,,,"Sokol, Karen C.",,,SEEKING (SOME) CLIMATE JUSTICE IN STATE TORT LAW,WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Over the last decade, an increasing number of path-breaking cases have been filed throughout the world, seeking to hold fossil fuel industry companies and governments accountable for their actions and inactions that have contributed to the climate crisis. This Article focuses on an important subset of those cases-namely, the recent surge of cases brought by states, cities, and counties all over the United States alleging that the largest fossil fuel industry actors, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron, are liable in state tort law for harms caused by climate change. The Article begins with a synthesis of the history of U.S. climate tort litigation, grouping the cases into two waves. The current state tort cases are in the second wave and represent an attempt to avoid the legal pitfalls that plagued the first. The Article then undertakes the first close examination of the defendants response to the second-wave climate tort cases; namely, that the federal common law of nuisance preempts all the plaintiffs state tort claims. Unsurprisingly, the issue has divided the courts that have decided it, as the Supreme Court case law is sparse and unclear. The Article identifies the doctrinal problem in the case law, and then argues that the only way to bring coherence to the law while adhering to federalism principles is to disallow preemption of state tort law by federal common law in these cases. Finally, the Article offers a new perspective on why that is also the right result as a policy matter. The second-wave climate tort suits are part of a larger global movement of resorting to the courts to demand climate justice after decades of inaction by policymakers. The current era of climate disruption and its catastrophic threats demand not only new and improved legal and policy mechanisms, but also the use of current ones-including state tort law-to the fullest extent possible.","[Sokol, Karen C.] Loyola Univ, New Orleans Coll Law, Law, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Sokol, KC (corresponding author), Loyola Univ, New Orleans Coll Law, Law, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",kcsokol@loyno.edu,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,UNIV WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF LAW,SEATTLE,"WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW 1100 NE CAMPUS PARKWAY 410 CONDON HALL, SEATTLE, WA 98105 USA",0043-0617,,,WASH LAW REV,Wash.

J,"Grasa, R",,,,"Grasa, Rafael",,,Direct violence and distributive conflicts about water.The evolution of analytical debate and the proposal of a new approach,RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Water; social distributive conflict; direct violence; intervention; governance,,"The article pursues two objectives: a) to comparatively trace the debates on the relationship between armed conflicts or direct violence and situations of stress / water shortage or distributive confrontations (resources or shared basins, for example) surrounding water, and in doing so add to the systematization of recent approaches; and b) based on the results of the aforementioned, propose new tools for the analysis and intervention in these conflicts, taking advantage, by way of example and not of detailed analysis, of ten current and heterogeneous cases of distributive conflicts over water. This issue became popular in the nineties of the twentieth century with striking statements that proclaimed: the next wars would not be for oil or mineral resources but for access to drinking water In this sense, the current paper focuses on examining the debate between 1985 and 1995, where the dominant issue was on whether water scarcity or water competition could be a direct causal factor of violent conflicts, or if it was simply a multiplier or accelerating factor linked to other causes. These contributions, while previously dominated by the omnipresence of approaches and texts based on security studies and the then so called ecological security, are now based on contributions from studies of the analysis, resolution and transformation of conflicts. Meanwhile, new epistemological reflections respectful of cultural and gender bias are also present, along with non-western-centric approaches. Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, factual changes, new narratives, and novel guidelines for analysis have urged scholars to revisit the debate on the present and future relationships between armed conflict -or direct violence- and the scarcity or competition for water resources. I have just mentioned factual changes, among which I will highlight the following: significant ongoing changes in geopolitics and geo-economics; changes in the location and nature of direct violence, given that 80% of homicide deaths in the world are not related to direct violence of a clearly political nature (that is, armed conflict and terrorism), something that is linked with the strong growth of private security actors (legal and illegal) and a partial loss of the state's monopoly on the massive instruments of violence; ongoing mutations in the nature and spread of power; a progressive de-westernization of the international system and of the ways of analyzing it (international theory); the emergence of climate change and the climate emergency agenda and, in addition, the pandemics linked to recurrent zoonosis processes; and, to close this list, and returning to the topic being studies in this issue of the journal, the central position that water occupies in the 2030 agenda and in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, we need new tools that allow us to analyze and better understand these conflicts related to water, in general, and also their occurrences in the major geopolitical areas of the world in the coming decades (Asia,Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean). Regarding the new narratives and analysis guidelines, the paper focuses on the new approaches in the area of analysis, resolution and transformation of conflicts that have emerged from the consensus on liberal peace, along with contributions from political ecology specialized in distributive environmental conflicts and environmental justice. Taking into account these new epistemological reflections, including those related to identity, is important as it allows one to focus on causality, and the tools that facilitate its analysis In addition to its introduction and conclusions, this article has three sections.The first establishes a factual starting point, summarizing the data related to fresh drinking water. Through a succinct description of ten conflicts, both intra and international, and from various continents and regions, this establishes a central thesis: the most significant conflict causation factor is not so much the lack of water, but the management and governance of water in general and its shortages. Secondly, it summarizes the analysis and the results of the debate on water conflicts, in particular on the causation links between water use and scarcity and direct violence from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s of the last century.The third section presents new perspectives, based not on security studies or ecological security, as before, but on the consolidated works of peace research, and studies on conflict analysis and transformation. Specifically, the main contributions and findings are displayed, and, also, a seminal framework to apply them to water conflicts, through three assumptions and seven theses. Finally, the conclusions insist on the need to treat these conflicts as social conflicts, showing that their specificity is linked to the management and governance of the resource rather than the scarcity itself. In the concluding remarks, the paper highlights that the most pertinent features of any analysis and intervention in environmental conflicts, especially those that are persistent and difficult to resolve (what American literature usually calls intractable conflicts) do not reside in the adjective environmental, or hydric, as the mainstream suggested in the first half of the 1990s. What is really meaningful is that they are social conflicts, basically distributive conflicts, and linked to the search for fairer solutions; that is, related to the allocation, use and / or management of environmental goods. The specificity provided by the adjective environmental or hydric exists, of course, beyond its growing importance for the contextual reasons already mentioned -such as demographic pressure, climate change or pollution and destruction of resources. However, this does not justify a differentiated treatment for these conflicts, as was the case previously. They are social conflicts, and therefore marked by cultural and contextual differences. Therefore, this means that they must be analyzed and intervened upon, in order to manage, resolve and transform them, with the same tools and techniques used for all the social distributive conflicts.We can call them environmental, orhydric if that is the case, but only if this means that we do not stop dealing with them as social conflicts. And moreover, we must not forget that like most of these conflicts, it is necessary to apply analytical filters to them based on knowledge of the logic of collective action, public goods and collective goods Finally, the paper argues that these conflicts and the new analytical and resolutions framework force us to modify the famous formula of thinking globally, acting locally.Today, to tackle them, you also have to think in a multidimensional way, and, in many cases, act globally. In doing so, the paper emphasizes the governance and governance challenges that need to be addressed.","[Grasa, Rafael] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Univ Relac Int, Barcelona, Spain","Grasa, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Univ Relac Int, Barcelona, Spain.",rafael.grasa@uab.cat,,,,,,21,0,0,6,9,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,MADRID,"UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, MADRID, 00000, SPAIN",1699-3950,,,RELAC INT-MADR,Relac.

The paper moves along the path traced by Wood and Roelich (2019) with their Tensions Triangle Theory, but aims to develop it further from an operational point of view, showing how contemporary ecological tax reforms, if inspired by the Capabilities Approach, could more effectively contribute to achieving an inclusive, sustainable, accessible and secure global energy system, that provides solutions to energy challenges and, at the same time, creates value for business and civil society as a whole, without compromising the balance between the three fundamental elements of the tensions triangle described by Wood and Roelich. In particular, this chapter aims to show how the enlargement of the tax area according to new criteria of distributive justice inspired by the Capabilities Approach could serve to increase the mobility of social assets and to develop strategies to adapt public finance systems to the changes produced not only by environmental emergencies, but also by other sudden and adverse phenomena, such as economic crises and significant revenue losses caused by the adoption of non-transparent or harmful tax practices. Finally, the paper considers the proposal to establish taxes on so-called global commons-such as the atmosphere, climate, healthy environment, oceans-and to redistribute their revenue to reduce economic inequalities and poverty.","[Villani, Salvatore; Viscolo, Maria] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Publ Econ, Naples, Italy","Villani, S (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Publ Econ, Naples, Italy.",salvatore.villani@unina.it,,,,,,92,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2515-7620,,,ENVIRON RES COMMUN,Environ.

However, the policy tools oriented to address this issue have received little research attention, particularly in the Global South. Thus, this research analyses the effectiveness of the social impact assessment (SIA) in Mexico's RE sector. In 2014 the government of Mexico introduced the SIA in response to the social conflicts around RE projects. The SIA has generated some favorable changes in the sector's social management. Yet, its effectiveness is constrained by diverse issues related to its institutional and regulatory design, government implementation, practices of companies and consultants, and restricted social involvement. Moreover, the sector's socio-technical arrangement (priorities, organization, experience, and policies) strongly influences the performance of SIAs and accounts for the lack of consideration of social aspects in project design and planning. We argue that without a substantial internalization of the social dimension in the priorities, policy, and planning of RE, the SIA would be limited to a problem-fixing role, which would constrain the effective management of social impacts.","[Martinez, Nain] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Martinez, Nain; Komendantova, Nadejda] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Adv Syst Anal Program, Laxenburg, Austria","Martinez, N (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",nain.martinez@berkeley.edu,"Komendantova, Nadejda/AAI-1536-2021","Komendantova, Nadejda/0000-0003-2568-6179",UC MEXUS-CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"The authors are grateful to UC MEXUS-CONACYT for providing a fellowship for a doctoral dissertation in which this article is part of the outputs; the Young Scientist Summer Program at International Institute for Applied System Analysis, in which part of this research was conducted; and Iniciativa Clim.atica de M.exico for facilitating the fieldwork.

However, which reserves should be left in the ground, and when and how should reserve-owners be compensated?

We argue that Western nations should compensate Uganda for their foregone oil revenues and we propose a mechanism called climate easements for such compensation.","[Snyder, Brian F.] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Ruyle, Leslie E.] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, Scowcroft Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Snyder, BF (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",snyderb@lsu.edu; ruyle@tamu.edu,,"Ruyle, Leslie/0000-0001-7463-3669",,,,51,1,1,2,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Simultaneously, climate change leads to increased frequency and intensity of cloudbursts and hot spells. To counteract experienced problems, cities are increasingly working to improve urban green space through actively including nature-based solutions (NBS) and their related ecosystem services (ES). From an urban sustainable development perspective, it is important to understand where and how to work with NBS and ES, to benefit the whole society. This task of urban ES governance is challenging, especially as the possibilities to work with green space depend on the amount of available space, which varies greatly in and between cities. The aim of the study was to assess how local stakeholders involved in urban development and regeneration processes in a neighbourhood perceive the physical/environmental and social structures, and their interactions in relation to ES provision. The study focuses on actors that directly or indirectly influence the wellbeing of local residents in the district Sofielund in Malmo, Sweden, and is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 stakeholders, including property owners or managers, businesses and local representatives from the Swedish Union of Tenants. The results show that local stakeholder involvement is a key to a just urban ES governance. Without acknowledging different stakeholder perspectives, there is a risk that those with more power and louder voices may steer the urban development in a certain direction, leaving the rest devoid of influence. Approaches to involve local residents exist in Sofielund, both within the local community, housing organizations, as well as a part of the ordinary planning process, but several barriers exist for a more structured participatory culture where the interest of local residents are taken into consideration. Particularly relevant for the interviewed stakeholders, is the identified lack of structure for participation and communication between property owners and the municipality. If the distribution of ES is unequal and participatory structures are lacking, stakeholders will perceive that their interests are not considered. In a short-term perspective, this will create unsatisfaction and decreased trust. In the longer perspective, it may create a degradation of the neighbourhood where economically stronger inhabitants move out. By ensuring, that local inhabitants perceive that their needs of green space are recognized and that a potential uneven distributions of ES provision is considered, it is possible to achieve a more just sustainable urban development. Based on these findings, we make four recommendations on how a just urban ES governance could be developed; social and physical development has to be seen as a whole, power structures have to be recognized, inclusive engagement structures have to be put in place, measurements of ES have to target relative ES provision, related to the needs of differet groups of residents groups.","[Olsson, Johanna Alkan; Brunner, Jonas; Nordin, Amanda; Hanson, Helena, I] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Olsson, JA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",Johanna.alkan_olsson@cec.lu.se,,,"Mistra Urban Futures project Cities2Cities, Climate KIC; Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2016-00324, 2017-01943]","The research was financed by Mistra Urban Futures project Cities2Cities, Climate KIC, the Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Nature-based solutions for urban challenges' project (grant number 2016-00324), Urban design and everyday life choices: On the built environment as a co-producer of climate ethics (grant number 2017-01943),",,92,3,3,13,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This Special Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices, and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Del Rio, Dylan Furszyfer] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Del Rio, Dylan Furszyfer] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Griffiths, Steve] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,,"Furszyfer Del Rio, Dylan/0000-0001-7860-8700; Griffiths, Steven/0000-0002-9593-4724",,,,60,28,28,7,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The article is framed within a new materialist approach to environmental education, and specifically works to re-imagine the notion of justice in terms of performative gestures, multiplicities, processes, and speculative thought experiments. Drawing on Whitehead's speculative philosophy in conjunction with recent new materialist thought, the article proposes the concept of 'doing little justices' as a way of enacting micropolitical interventions into everyday patterns of environmental thought, learning, sociality, and behaviour. The concept of 'little justices' is further elaborated through the analysis of vignettes that problematise issues of climate change, human exceptionalism, ecological sovereignty, and environmental justice with university students in the fields of education and the philosophy of law. The article concludes that an immanent ethics cannot be reduced to a set of predetermined values or prescriptions for environmental education, but should proceed through a speculative process of creative experimentation and negotiation in the pursuit of unforeseen openings and potentials for co-existence.","[Rousell, David] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Educ & Social Res Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England","Rousell, D (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Educ & Social Res Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England.",d.rousell@mmu.ac.uk,,,,,,50,9,9,4,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

Drought, heat waves, floods and cold spells are impediments to a sustainable development for nomads. So far, previous adaptation strategies have not sufficiently proved effective in improving their livelihood. The present study aimed at designing a development model for organizing nomads of the Zagros region. The grounded theory methodology was applied to construct the hypothesis through inductive qualitative data. We used questionnaires, focus groups and in-depth interviews to survey the opinions of experts and managers about optimum ways to organize and develop Iranian nomadic communities. Researchers analyzed the data using open, axial and selective coding to discover the main concepts. The samples were selected through the snowball effect sampling method in which sampling continued until a theoretical saturation was reached. To recognize concepts and categories, line by line analysis was used in open coding. The present study revealed how various aspects of nomadic livelihood can affect managerial efforts to organize and develop nomadic life in the region. These effective aspects were categorized into three main groups: causal, interfering and background. Also, the results introduced a comprehensive adaptation strategy model based on grounded theory which covered many aspects of the nomadic livelihood. Our results suggested that this approach is more likely to ensure the sustainability of environmental resources, social justice and improvements in economic indicators.","[Taheri, Mohammad; Poursaeed, Alireza; Arayesh, Mohammad-Bagher] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Ilam Branch, Ilam, Iran; [Eshraghi-Samani, Roya] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Agr Management, Ilam Branch, Ilam, Iran","Poursaeed, A (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Ilam Branch, Ilam, Iran.",A_poursaeed@yahoo.com,,"Arayesh, Mohamad Bagher/0000-0002-6716-7943",,,,64,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10708-020-10310-4,,OCT 2020,14,Geography,Geography,NX5BX,WOS:000575727400001,,,,,2021-08-07,

Students and films predominantly framed action as something that individuals, including youth, can and should do by making small choices in their daily lives. These choices were framed as being effective when many individuals participate in them. Co-produced films spread messages of hope and educated and motivated others to make similar choices. While the dominant framing was one of individual behavior change, there was some contrasting discourse that framed action as a collective social process or necessary at a more systemic level. We discuss these actions across scales from individual behavior change to collective and system-oriented change in terms of hope, agency, neoliberalism, and justice.","[Tayne, Kelsey] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, 2445 Kittredge Loop Rd, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Tayne, Kelsey; Littrell, Megan K.; Okochi, Christine; Gold, Anne U.; Leckey, Erin] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci CIRES, Boulder, CO 80302 USA","Tayne, K (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, 2445 Kittredge Loop Rd, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",kelsey.tayne@colorado.edu,,"Littrell, Megan/0000-0002-8378-1329; GOLD, ANNE/0000-0002-5309-0762",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL-1513320],This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DRL-1513320.,,71,2,2,4,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

While the rights of Indigenous peoples are recognized internationally, these are not translated into adaptation responses. Using insights from theories of environmental justice in the case of Uganda's Batwa community, we assess how justice-related factors impact their adaptive capacities and whether these are incorporated in the design and implementation of adaptation responses. Our findings reveal a multi-dimensional range of systemic injustices experienced by Batwa, resulting from their continued social-economic, cultural and political marginalization. Additionally, a variety of projects are happening locally in relation to 'adaptation' but not labelled as such, suggesting how Batwa's vulnerability is rooted in wider aspects of livelihoods and development. Most projects tend to focus on distribution of material benefits, while less attention is paid to the more intricate issues of compensation, political discrimination and uneven participation. This depoliticized and compartmentalized approach suggests a slow and incomplete way of operationalizing justice. Hence, we call for sincere efforts to address recognition, rights, and disproportionate levels of disadvantage for Indigenous communities, including their constitutional recognition, financial redress and participation in decision-making.","[Satyal, Poshendra; Byskov, Morten Fibieger; Hyams, Keith] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Satyal, Poshendra] BirdLife Int, Policy Team, Cambridge, England","Satyal, P (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England.; Satyal, P (corresponding author), BirdLife Int, Policy Team, Cambridge, England.",poshendrasatyal@gmail.com,,,British Academy's Tackling UK's International Challenges Programme [IC2_100139],This study was part of the Remedying Injustice in Indigenous Climate Adaptation Planning project in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick.

In this Profile, we therefore reflect on the distinctiveness of the 'new climate activism' as compared to previous climate campaigns.

This type of research should take advantage of the many benefits offered by indirect remote sensing, geographic information systems, and other related disciplines data that are based on relationships developed at the field. Nevertheless, many facets of the subject including the relationship between human population distribution (HPD) and land surface temperature (LST) in areas that have different climatic classifications are still lacking attention. Hence, this study focused on bridging this gap in order to provide supporting scientific evidence for planners and decision makers all over the globe. Four areas that represent the four main populated climate zones were randomly selected. They are: (1) ElSalvador for equatorial climate, (2) Kuwait for arid climate, (3) Lebanon for warm temperate climate, and (4) New Hampshire for boreal climate. For the years 2001, 2009, and 2017 for the four areas, HPD data were obtained from LandScan project while LST data were derived from MOD11C3 product. An integrated framework approach was implemented. This approach included: (1) basic descriptive non-spatial statistics, (2) spatial Global Moran's I Index and Anselin Local Moran's I Index, (3) non-spatial Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and (4) spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM) regressions. It has been observed that the strength and direction of the relationship between HPD and LST do not vary from time to time but vary from climate zone to another. The strongest relationship can be found in boreal climates, followed by warm temperate climates, and then arid and equatorial climates. In boreal, warm temperate, and equatorial climates the relationship is positive while in arid climates the relationship is negative providing indirect supporting evidence for the inversion of surface urban heat islands phenomenon in arid climates. Furthermore, it has been noticed that the relationship between HPD and LST is highly spatially dependent regardless the time and climate zone where some type of spatial diffusion or spillover processes might be present. Still, it is clear that this relationship is complex and not amenable to direct explanation and needs further investigation in order to be explained.","[Jaber, Salahuddin M.] Hashemite Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Water Management & Environm, POB 330010, Zarqa 13133, Jordan","Jaber, SM (corresponding author), Hashemite Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Water Management & Environm, POB 330010, Zarqa 13133, Jordan.",sjaber@hu.edu.jo,,"Jaber, Salahuddin/0000-0002-8510-2203",,,,91,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-9385,,,REMOTE SENS APPL,Remote Sens.

This article builds on theories of multiscalar research and the politics of location to develop a conceptual framework of urban change through the lens of climate justice.","[Goh, Kian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Goh, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",kiangoh@ucla.edu,,/0000-0003-1830-2392,"Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); William Emerson Travel Fund (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Harold Horowitz Research Fund (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Northeastern University Tier-1 grant; University of California, Los Angeles Faculty Career Development AwardUniversity of California System","I thank the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society special issue editors and the three anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

Yet levels of oil production and consumption remain high in the state. This gap between California's oil politics and its climate ambitions is deepened by decentralized decision-making processes. County officials are tasked with extractive planning decisions that have wide-ranging implications. In this Viewpoint article, we analyze proposals for enhanced extraction at the Cat Canyon oilfield in Santa Barbara County. After two of three proposals were withdrawn in recent months, we highlight how it has been oil industry volatility and public opposition - rather than state regulations - that have brought county development plans into closer alignment with state climate goals. As California pursues a goal of 'managing the decline' of domestic oil production, we identify strategies for bridging such gaps between local decision-making and state-level climate action, including: a comprehensive state-wide ban on new enhanced oil extraction projects; a 2,500 ft buffer zone around extraction sites; and revenue generation schemes that support a just transition. As Covid-19 forces an oil surplus and lowered production, there are opportunities to enact such changes - particularly by redirecting oil industry labor toward the growing problem of well decommissioning.","[Partridge, Tristan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Social Behav & Econ Res, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Barandiaran, Javiera; Bakardzhieva, Kalina; Bronstein, Leah] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Global Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Walsh, Casey] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hernandez, Monica] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Partridge, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Social Behav & Econ Res, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",tristan.partridge@ucsb.edu,,"Partridge, Tristan/0000-0003-3770-8494","Institute for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB); Faculty Research Assistance Program in the College of Letters & Science at UCSB; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona [MDM-2015-0552]","Funding for this research was provided by the Institute for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) for the project, Knowing the underground: collaborative research on emergent oil and water politics in central California (Collaborative Research Initiative Grant).

Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS. In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice. The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research.","[Woroniecki, Stephen] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies TEMA, Environm Change Unit TEMAM, Linkoping, Sweden; [Brink, Ebba; Islar, Mine; Krause, Torsten; Vargas, Ana-Maria] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Wendo, Hausner] Adaptat Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; [Vargas, Ana-Maria] Swedish Int Ctr Local Democracy, Visby, Gotland, Sweden; [Mahmoud, Yahia] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Lund, Sweden","Woroniecki, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies TEMA, Environm Change Unit TEMAM, Linkoping, Sweden.",stephen.woroniecki@liu.se,,,,,,142,3,3,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Her actions sparked a historically large youth movement, leading to a series of school strikes across the world. Over the course of one week in September 2019, striking school children, students and other grassroots movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, called for everyone to participate in a global Climate Strike. This paper is based on comparative research with climate protesters in six cities: Brighton and London (United Kingdom), Montreal (Canada), New Haven and New York (USA), and Stavanger (Norway). Based on original interviews with 64 protesters, the study examines their knowledge, emotions, motivations, and actions in relation to climate change, including any lifestyle changes they have undertaken before or after their protests. Our findings show that protesters have varying degrees of knowledge about climate change, and have taken a range of actions in their own lives to address climate change. They also manifest a wide spectrum of emotions about climate change, and different motivations for taking part in climate strikes. These features are under-studied and dynamically evolving at the present conjuncture. On this basis, we call for expanded academic attention to human, emotional, epistemic, and seemingly mundane aspects of climate protests, their structural tendencies and relational expressions, and the implications for our ability to address underlying drivers.","[Martiskainen, Mari; Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Del Rio, Dylan Furszyfer] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Sch Business, Falmer, E Sussex, England; [Axon, Stephen] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Bergen, Norway; [Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway; [Del Rio, Dylan Furszyfer] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy CEP, London, England; [Del Rio, Dylan Furszyfer] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Del Rio, Dylan Furszyfer] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Axon, Kayleigh] Foote Sch, New Haven, CT USA","Martiskainen, M (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 323, Falmer BN1 95L, E Sussex, England.",m.martiskainen@sussex.ac.uk,,"Axon, Stephen/0000-0003-1166-6118; Furszyfer Del Rio, Dylan/0000-0001-7860-8700",University of Sussex Business School Research Excellence Award for Emerging Scholars 2019; Trond Mohn Foundation; University of Bergen Equinor Akademia Agreement,This work was partly supported by the University of Sussex Business School Research Excellence Award for Emerging Scholars 2019; and The Trond Mohn Foundation and the University of Bergen Equinor Akademia Agreement.,,83,8,8,17,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Thus, as a first step, it is crucial to assess the learning capacity of water actors in different levels, as human components of a socio-ecological system (SES), to know how to improve the water resources system adaptive capacity. Aiming at practicing assessment of learning capacity in a society of water actors, the present paper focuses on local water users, one the society of farmers using the groundwater resource in Rafsanjan Plain and the other one the society of farmers in Lakes Tashk-Bakhtegan Basin, both situated in the southern Iran. A methodological framework was developed and adopted to assess the learning capacity of water users corresponding to both the process of learning (represented by social justice, perception of interdependency, mutual trust, and interaction among all stakeholders) and the learning outcomes (including width, direction, depth and orientation of learning). The required data were collected using semi-structured interviews. The results showed how the responses of the local water users are affected by the mechanisms which are rooted in the social memory, technology, path dependency, and the degree of access to water. Although most of the researchers have addressed the social learning to have positive and constructive outcomes, the results of this research revealed the process of social learning resulted in neutral and destructive outcomes among water users in the study areas. Assessment of learning capacity in the water associated societies, using the methodological framework developed in this research, can help set off removing learning barriers and enhancing the socio-ecological system adaptive capacity.","[Benhangi, Saman Moghimi; Bagheri, Ali; Razi, Hassan Hamidi] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran; [Benhangi, Saman Moghimi; Bagheri, Ali] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Res Inst Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran; [Bagheri, Ali] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Abolhassani, Leili] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Agr Econ, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran","Bagheri, A (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran.",ali.bagheri@modares.ac.ir; l.abolhasani@um.ac.ir,,,Water Research Institute [320-9412-03]; Iran Water Management Think Tank,The Tashk-Bakhtegan part of this research was supported by Water Research Institute associated to the Iranian Ministry of Energy in terms of a project entitled: Institutional analysis of adaptive capacity of water resources management system in Tashk-Bakhtegan Basin to the effects of climate change under the contract No. 320-9412-03.; The field works for the Rafsanjan part of this research were carried out with the full support of the Iran Water Management Think Tank.

Such disasters are expected to become more frequent and severe. Now more than ever, it is crucial to understand how these events amplify existing inequalities, and how to lessen the resulting harms. Differences in human vulnerability to disaster stem from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors. We argue that given their social status, undocumented Latino/a and Indigenous immigrants are particularly vulnerable to disasters and require special consideration in disaster planning. They are disproportionately affected by racial discrimination, exploitation, economic hardships, less English and Spanish proficiency, and fear of deportation in their everyday lives-their pre-disaster marginalized status. In the case of the Thomas Fire in California's Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, we show that emergency response and recovery efforts ignored their needs. Resources were directed toward privileged individuals, leaving local immigrant rights and environmental justice groups to provide essential services such as language access to emergency information in Spanish and Indigenous tongues; labor protections for farmworkers endangered in the fields; and a private disaster relief fund for undocumented immigrants ineligible for federal aid. The article concludes with preliminary participant observations from the COVID-19 pandemic response in the region, indicating how lessons from the fire have informed official actions. As governments grapple with the increasing severity of disasters, understanding the differential impacts on undocumented immigrants can help improve disaster planning to protect the most vulnerable and stigmatized populations.","[Mendez, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Ecol, Dept Urban Planning & Publ Policy, 300 Social Ecol 1, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Flores-Haro, Genevieve] Mixteco Indigena Community Organizing Project, 520 W 5th St,Suite G, Oxnard, CA 93030 USA; [Zucker, Lucas] Cent Coast Alliance United Sustainable Econ CAUSE, 2021 Sperry Ave 9, Ventura, CA 93003 USA","Mendez, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Ecol, Dept Urban Planning & Publ Policy, 300 Social Ecol 1, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",Mamende6@uci.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We would like to thank David Pellow, Hallie Eakin, Jennifer Horney, Dean Hardy, Jonathan London, Katherine Jacobs, Benjamin Warner, William Funderburk, and Lori Peek and the NSF supported Enabling the Next Generation of Disaster Scholars fellowship for their generous comments and support.

The ideas shared are based on a keynote address given by the author at the International Conference on Climate Change, Indigenous Resilience and Local Knowledge Systems: Cross-time and Cross-boundary Perspectives held at the National Taiwan University on 13-14 December 2019. The primary audience for this essay is Indigenous Peoples and allies of Indigenous Peoples who are actively involved in climate change studies, sustainable community building, and education. As such, it presents the author's personal view of key orientations for shifting current paradigms by introducing an Indigenized conceptual framework of community building which can move Indigenous communities toward revitalization and renewal through strategically implementing culturally responsive Indigenous science education, engaging sustainable economics and sustainability studies. As an Indigenous scholar who has maintained an insider perspective and has worked extensively with community members around issues of culturally responsive science education, the author challenges all concerned to take Indigenous science seriously as an ancient body of applied knowledge for sustaining communities and ensuring survival over time and through generations. The author also challenges readers to initiate new thinking about how to use Indigenous science, community building, and education as a tool and a body of knowledge which may be integrated with appropriate forms of Western science in new and creative ways that serve to sustain and ensure survival rather than perpetuate unexamined Western business paradigms of community development.","[Cajete, Gregory A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Language Literacy & Sociocultural Studies, Amer Indian Educ, Albuquerque, NM 87144 USA; [Cajete, Gregory A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Native Amer Studies, Albuquerque, NM 87144 USA","Cajete, GA (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Language Literacy & Sociocultural Studies, Amer Indian Educ, Albuquerque, NM 87144 USA.; Cajete, GA (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Native Amer Studies, Albuquerque, NM 87144 USA.",gcajete@unm.edu,,,,,,14,2,2,4,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9569,10.3390/su12229569,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OY9ZC,WOS:000594595600001,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

Assessment methods for urban sustainability typically factor in the ecological dimensions of greenspace, such as biodiversity maintenance, stormwater management, and/or air quality-yet indicator schemas that consider only the ecological dimensions largely overlook the social benefits of some types of urban greenspace, particularly community gardens and orchards. This article makes the case that the process of community formation and strengthening that occurs in shared growing spaces is an important element of urban sustainability in its own right. Based on 55 interviews of community garden advocates, policy-makers, and development professionals involved in urban agriculture planning, this article traces the widespread understanding among practitioners that shared growing spaces strengthen social as well as environmental sustainability, though the social benefits are often difficult to measure. The latter concern was most frequently expressed by urban agriculture advocates who, after involvement in the political process, perceived the need for such metrics in order to communicate persuasively with planners and policy makers. The social values of shared growing spaces, at once self-evident to garden advocates and difficult for them to demonstrate with quantitative data, may be theorized by drawing on insights from sociology: A truly sustainable city requires community coalescence among diverse citizens, and such community is fostered particularly well in shared growing spaces.","[Glennie, Charlotte] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Glennie, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cfglennie@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,119,0,0,8,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9680,10.3390/su12229680,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OZ0FA,WOS:000594611000001,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

We conducted a survey of 491 Blacks in the District and asked 26 questions/statements related to natural resources, climate change, economics, and health. Participants were categorized into four age groups 18-25, 26-40, 41-65, and 66 and older for analysis. We found that the level of environmental knowledge across the age groups was relatively high and largely similar. Our results suggest that Blacks care about the environment, see the environment as beneficial to their health, and are knowledgeable about natural resources. However, younger Blacks (18-25) were the least likely to think of the natural world as a community to which they belong, report feelings of connection to it, and recognize that it impacts their personal welfare. In conclusion, we find that Blacks in the District possess environmental awareness and use local environmental language, depicting the uniqueness of their community. The mainstream environmental movement may fail to recognize this local language, leading to exclusion of vulnerable populations based on a faulty premise that these populations lack knowledge or interest in environmental issues.","[Harrison, Elgloria] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Sch Hlth Sci Human Serv & Nursing, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Harrison, Elgloria; Milton, Ashley D.; Richardson, Matthew L.] Univ Dist Columbia, Coll Agr Urban Sustainabil & Environm Sci, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Milton, Ashley D.] She Grows ItTM, Washington, DC 20032 USA","Harrison, E (corresponding author), CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Sch Hlth Sci Human Serv & Nursing, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.; Harrison, E (corresponding author), Univ Dist Columbia, Coll Agr Urban Sustainabil & Environm Sci, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",elgloria.harrison@lehman.cuny.edu; ashley@shegrowsit.com; matthew.richardson@udc.edu,,"Richardson, Matthew/0000-0001-9769-1669; Harrison, Elgloria/0000-0003-2627-9524",USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [15-JV-11242306-076],This project was partially funded by USDA Joint Venture Agreement 15-JV-11242306-076 between the USDA Northeast Climate Hub and the University of the District of Columbia.,,38,0,0,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9495,10.3390/su12229495,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OZ0IG,WOS:000594619400001,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

This study explores the feasibility of constructing an EJ index for Malta, as a case study of these territories. EJ issues were identified by consulting relevant literature and local experts. Based on this, five environmental variables (air pollution, noise pollution, lack of greenery, overcrowding and overdevelopment, and proximity to locally unwanted land uses) and three social variables (education, unemployment, and health) were selected for inclusion in the index. For the identified variables, indicators were chosen and calculated for each locality, while using a Geographic Information System to process and visualize spatial data. Cumulative environmental burden and social vulnerability scores were calculated based on quintile ranking of indicators. After normalization, cumulative scores were aggregated to derive the EJ index. The preliminary evaluation of EJ distribution in Malta demonstrated significant spatial differences. A statistically significant positive correlation of moderate strength between cumulative environmental burden and social vulnerability scores showed that EJ issues are present in Malta, notwithstanding its small size. Despite limitations, this exploratory index provides a basis for further EJ research in small island states.","[Portelli, Maria-Stella; Conrad, Elisabeth; Galdies, Charles] Univ Malta, Inst Earth Syst, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta","Portelli, MS (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Inst Earth Syst, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta.",maria-stella.portelli.09@um.edu.mt; charles.galdies@um.edu.mt; charles.galdies@um.edu.mt,,"Conrad, Elisabeth/0000-0002-3576-9288",Endeavour Scholarship Scheme (Malta); European Union-European Social Fund (ESF)-Operational Programme II-Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 Investing in human capital to create more opportunities and promote the well-being of society,This research was partially funded by the Endeavour Scholarship Scheme (Malta).

Limited by the ideology of its structural roots and its selective material approach, climate urbanism facilitates projects that protect some urban populations while simultaneously increasing the vulnerability of others. If allowed to continue on its current trajectory, the dominant mode of climate urbanism threatens to exacerbate a crisis-contingent mode of capitalism that would intensify various forms of inequality and injustice. The future of climate urbanism is not predetermined, however. This short paper explores the volatile origins of climate urbanism and seeks out areas for intervention. It does so with the aim of derailing the current polarizing trajectory of climate urbanism in order to replace it with a mode of climate urbanism that prioritizes a more heterogeneous, post-colonial, and transformative vision.","[Long, Joshua] Southwestern Univ, Environm Studies, 1001 E Univ Dr, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA; [Rice, Jennifer L.] Univ Georgia, Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Long, J (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ, Environm Studies, 1001 E Univ Dr, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA.",jlong@southwestern.edu,,,,,,48,2,2,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/02723638.2020.1841470,,NOV 2020,7,Geography; Urban Studies,Geography; Urban Studies,OQ9LS,WOS:000589097900001,,,,,2021-08-07,

In this paper we focus on arguably the most vital global security challenge faced throughout the planet today: climate resilience. We outline how advancing smart climate action and securing climate resilience can be aided by securitization practices that recall the earlier emphases of the United Nations' human security concept. The paper draws upon evidence from the Caribbean as a territory defined dominantly as part of the Global South, yet offering vital knowledge of productive climate security governance that can be instructive to the Global North. The impacts of global warming are particularly evident for the people of small island developing states such as those located in the Caribbean. By analysing the case of Cuba as a country increasingly resilient to extreme weather events, and by interrogating the genealogy of the broader Caribbean's hurricane culture, we show how an effective human security vision for climate justice and resilience can be achieved by recognizing and integrating the valuable forms of locally attuned knowledge that continue to emerge and coalesce in vulnerable geographies.","[Columbie, Yairen Jerez] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Sci Fdn Ireland Ctr Energy Climate & Marine, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Morrissey, John] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Geog & Archaeol, Coll Arts Social Sci & Celt Studies, Galway, Ireland","Columbie, YJ (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Sci Fdn Ireland Ctr Energy Climate & Marine, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland.",yairen.jerez@ucc.ie; john.morrissey@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,109,0,0,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2162-2671,2162-268X,,TERRIT POLIT GOV,Territ.

Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as disadvantaged communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state's communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community's likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability.","[Turek-Hankins, Lynee L.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Mentoring Undergrad Interdisciplinary Res MUIR Pr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Turek-Hankins, Lynee L.] Univ Miami, Environm Sci & Policy Grad Program, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Hino, Miyuki] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hino, Miyuki] Univ N Carolina, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Turek-Hankins, Lynee L.; Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mach, Katharine J.] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL USA","Turek-Hankins, LL (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Mentoring Undergrad Interdisciplinary Res MUIR Pr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Turek-Hankins, LL (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Environm Sci & Policy Grad Program, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.; Turek-Hankins, LL (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",lturek@miami.edu,", 莺瑰之殇/ABG-2761-2020","Turek-Hankins, Lynee/0000-0003-3356-3283",Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research (MUIR) Program at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment; Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy at the University of Miami; Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at University of Miami,"This research was funded by the Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research (MUIR) Program at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, and the Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy at the University of Miami.",,69,0,0,3,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,NOV 4,2020,15,11,,,,,,,e0240841,10.1371/journal.pone.0240841,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,OR6WM,WOS:000589609300032,33147245,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

LS includes considerable commentary about how markets and marketing impact the physical and social environment. Additionally, the document provides religion-inspired ethical norms for market conditions, actions, and performance that reflect both (a) the social teachings of the Catholic Church as they have evolved over the past 125 years and, as we will explain, (b) a foundational predicate of macromarketing scholarship - that is, a recognition of market systems as the primary mechanism for effectively and efficiently provisioning goods and services in contemporary society. The intent of this paper is also to harmonize two perspectives of business purpose regarding ecological issues (i.e., ethical efficacy vs. economic efficiency), commonly seen as conflicting and mutually exclusive. Absent that harmonization, those perspectives appear to force a choice between social values and norms and economic incentives and circumstances - a dichotomy that is neither optimal nor practical. Rather, we recognize that key themes in Laudato si'(LS) - environmental stewardship, concern for social justice, and a common good orientation that supersedes economic advantage - also correspond to issues addressed by macromarketing scholars since that sub-discipline emerged. LS is foremost a powerful Call to Action for those who care about protecting the ecological environment. However, LS is intentionally vague about specific solutions. It defers to analysts, academics, and policy experts to provide those. This paper outlines how macromarketing researchers are powerfully positioned to suggest the specific market and policy adjustments called for in LS.","[Klein, Thomas A.] Univ Toledo, Mkt Emeritus, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Laczniak, Gene R.] Marquette Univ, Mkt Emeritus, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA","Laczniak, GR (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, Mkt Emeritus, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",Eugene.laczniak@marquette.edu,,,,,,173,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0276-1467,1552-6534,,J MACROMARKETING,J.

The movement represents a disruption to global climate mitigation solutions that are often formalized at a global scale, and illustrates cultural and economic constraints in providing social justice in the age of climate change. Using a cultural performative approach, this case study reveals the relevance of framing and cultural analyses to understand such resistance. This qualitative exploration initiates a narrative analysis to assess how the universal resolve of the 2015 Paris Conference and the related legitimacy of the sustainability discourse has been further contested by the Yellow Vests and their fractured framing. From the 'end of the world' to the 'end of the month', we investigate the rise and fall of the legitimacy of the French sustainability discourse by analysing politicians' and activists' speeches, historical narratives as well as visual materials of resistance in France in the context of sustainability transitions. Tip of a broader social crisis, the movement reveals an original conflict of temporalities, symptomatic of the inevitable interdependency of socio-economic inequalities to sustainability transitions. Beyond the resistance itself, the Yellow Vests embody an original exemplar for the importance of cultural appropriation within the sustainability discourse' legitimation processes.","[Martin, Mathilde] Lund Univ, Human Geog Dept, Lund, Sweden; [Islar, Mine] Lund Univ, LUCSUS, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden","Islar, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, LUCSUS, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden.",mathilde.martin@keg.lu.se; mine.islar@lucsus.lu.se,,"Martin, Mathilde/0000-0003-1738-0073; ISLAR, MINE/0000-0001-9479-4734",Lund University,Open access funding provided by Lund University.,,65,2,2,2,5,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Scientific and technological advances in food production during the last century enabled agriculture to cope with the concomitant increase in food demand. For example, cereal yields have more than doubled from a global average of 1.5 metric tons per hectare in the 1960s up to 3.2 metric tons per hectare in 2018. This was made possible by the work in different research fields such as agronomy, engineering, and plant sciences, showing that an inter and multidisciplinary approach is indispensable for significant progress. This manuscript is aimed at generating reflexion and analysis about the challenges that agriculture faces at present to satisfy projected food demands, which implies a further doubling of food production by 2050, according to the latest estimates. Relevant issues related to food production (climate change, pollution of water and soils by pesticides and fertilizers, loss of germplasm and biodiversity) are discussed and potential solutions to achieve food security in quantity and quality are reviewed, mainly from the plant breeding and crop-production perspectives, always associated with environmental health preservation and improvement. A broad transdisciplinary effort is needed to increase the impact of science and technology to provide more people with healthier and safer food, produced in a sustainable way. Nonetheless, science and technology alone will not succeed to meet those challenges. Education and knowledge transfer strategies are needed to guarantee responsible production and consumption everywhere, therefore allowing the benefits of scientific and technological progress reach the world population. Simultaneously, adequate action by regulatory authorities and governments concerted at international level, with thorough application of the Precautionary Principle, and aiming at environmental and social justice are imperatively required to meet the challenge and achieve the goal.","[Chavez-Dulanto, Perla N.] Univ Nacl Agr La Molina, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Sci, Av La Molina S-N, Lima 12, Peru; [Thiry, Arnauld A.

The core of the paradigm shift referenced in the report's title was that growth not only had to be decoupled from high carbon inputs but that in both practice and outcomes it had to be sustainable and inclusive. Yet the report does little to define social justice, equity practices, or inclusive outcomes in a green economy context. In this article, we foreground distributive, procedural and recognition aspects of social justice that are central to Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts and transition to a green, low carbon economy. We focus on two sectors that are key to this transition - forest and land-use, and energy. Our analysis shows that existing forms of injustice can exacerbate challenges for decarbonisation action and that low carbon transitions initiatives have been unable to overcome various forms of injustice and have, in some cases, created new injustices.","[Elliott, Lorraine] Australian Natl Univ, Int Relat, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Elliott, Lorraine] Earth Syst Governance Res Network, Sci Steering Comm, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Setyowati, Abidah B.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Regulat & Global Governance RegNet, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Elliott, L (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Int Relat, Canberra, ACT, Australia.; Elliott, L (corresponding author), Earth Syst Governance Res Network, Sci Steering Comm, Utrecht, Netherlands.",lorraine.elliott@anu.edu.au; abidah.setyowati@anu.edu.au,"Setyowati, Abidah/ABE-8637-2020","Setyowati, Abidah/0000-0002-2239-6849",,,,50,1,1,5,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-8374,1477-1500,,ASIAN AFF,Asian AFF,AUG 7,2020,51,4,,,,,875,894,,10.1080/03068374.2020.1835000,,NOV 2020,20,Area Studies,Area Studies,PA4ND,WOS:000592692600001,,,,,2021-08-07,

Design and Sample A scoping review of literature was conducted that described EJ nursing strategies and included nurses listed as authors, subjects, partners, or organizational members. The sample consisted of 35 articles, representing 24 primary research studies and 11 nonresearch articles. Data were separately analyzed by research and nonresearch articles for a clearer understanding of evidence-based strategies within domains of REAP. Results Articles in the sample highlighted the importance of authentic community partnership and represented diversity of nursing strategies that addressed a range of environmental exposures and subsequent health and racial inequities. Climate justice, a concept that emerged from the EJ movement and intersects with planetary health, is a recent focus in professional nursing. Conclusions This scoping review establishes an understanding of the extent of nursing knowledge and research in EJ and lays the groundwork for further research on effective EJ nursing strategies. Community-Based Participatory Research/Participatory Action Research methods are fundamental for EJ research, and further theoretical development is needed to guide evaluation of EJ nursing strategies for education, advocacy, and practice.","[LeClair, Jessica; Zahner, Susan] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Nursing, 3141 Signe Skott Cooper Hall,701 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Watts, Theresa] Univ Nevada, Orvis Sch Nursing, Reno, NV 89557 USA","LeClair, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Nursing, 3141 Signe Skott Cooper Hall,701 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",jleclair2@wisc.edu,,"Watts, Theresa/0000-0001-8015-0815; LeClair, Jessica/0000-0003-2420-8482",,,,61,1,1,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0737-1209,1525-1446,,PUBLIC HEALTH NURS,Public Health Nurs.,MAR,2021,38,2,,,,,296,308,,10.1111/phn.12840,,NOV 2020,13,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nursing","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nursing",RO1FS,WOS:000590289400001,33210747,,,,2021-08-07,

This situation represents a contravention of accepted norms of climate justice and calls attention to the need for better understanding of prospects for externally resourced adaptation initiatives in high mountain areas. In response, this paper examines the architecture of formal adaptation support mechanisms organized through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and how such mechanisms might help to meet adaptation needs in high mountain communities. It outlines key global adaptation initiatives organized through the UNFCCC, clarifies idealized linkages between these global adaptation initiatives and meeting local adaptation needs, and evaluates actual progress in connecting such support with discrete adaptation needs in the upper Manaslu region of Nepal. The paper then critically examines observed shortcomings in matching adaptation support organized through the UNFCCC with local adaptation needs, including complications stemming from the bureaucratic nature of formal adaptation support mechanisms, the intervening role of the state in delivering aid, and the ways in which these complexities intersect with the specific socio-cultural contexts of mountain communities. It concludes by highlighting several prospects for increasing the quantity and quality of adaptation support to mountain communities. These opportunities are considered alongside several salient concerns about formal adaptation support mechanisms in an effort to provide a well-rounded assessment of the prospects for planned adaptations in high mountain communities.","[McDowell, Graham; Harris, Leila; Koppes, Michele; Chan, Kai M.

The board of directors ensures these organizations fulfill their mission, making decisions on funding priorities and holding the organization functionally and fiscally responsible. Drawing on constructs of diversity and representative bureaucracy and a case study of Florida community foundations, we suggest that diversity is understood in different ways and the presence of diverse board members may be linked to advancing the interests of diverse communities and in achieving outcomes that assist in the needs of certain social groups.

Existing neoliberal climate adaptation responses, which often entrench inequality, are unlikely to succeed in informal settlements. The current groundswell of demands for social justice provide the needed impetus for exploring and experimenting with what adaptation might look like in informal settlements. This contribution suggests two areas for careful consideration when applying climate urbanism concepts to informal settlement contexts, namely (1) the temporal tension between adapting to climate change risk and simultaneously having to deal with other, perhaps more immediate, risks, and (2) the use of the concept of transformative adaptation to guide practice-based collaborative interventions.","[Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,,,AXA Research Fund,This work was supported by the AXA Research Fund.,,17,3,3,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/02723638.2020.1850629,,NOV 2020,5,Geography; Urban Studies,Geography; Urban Studies,OT1YZ,WOS:000590650400001,,,,,2021-08-07,

While XR has shifted the conversation on climate change, it has also been critiqued for its lack of attention to privilege and oppression, and for its 'apolitical' approach to climate organizing. In this article, we argue that XR must develop an intersectional approach in order to address the climate crisis. In particular, we reflect on our experiences as participants in XR-Vancouver, located on unceded Indigenous territory in the settler colonial state of Canada. Settler colonialism in Canada is intertwined with the climate and ecological crises, as Canada's status as a petrostate is built on the dispossession of Indigenous Peoples through a strategy of racial extractivism. To attend to these dynamics, we build on Kyle Powys Whyte's concept of 'decolonizing allyship' and suggest three ethics - of relational accountability, care, and incommensurability - that settler-led movements like XR can cultivate. We conclude by inviting XR to (re)engage with a 'politics of refusal' that subverts the state and allows XR to collectively enact what different systems (rooted in intersectional, decolonizing allyship) could look like.","[James, Dana] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resouces Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [James, Dana] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada","James, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resouces Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; James, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",,,"James, Dana/0000-0002-8219-697X",,,,112,0,0,1,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

The annual United Nations climate change negotiations, known as COPs, are key sites of global organizing and hope for a comprehensive approach to climate policy. Drawing on participant observation and in-depth interviews at COP25 in 2019, this research examines youth climate activists' priorities, frustrations and hopes for creating just climate policy. Youth are disillusioned with the COP process and highlight a variety of ways through which the COP perpetuates colonial power structures that marginalize Indigenous peoples and others fighting for justice. This is intersectional exclusion - the character of exclusion experienced by people with multiple intersecting marginalized identities. We demonstrate that the space, policies and even the social movement organizing at COP25 are exclusive, necessitating new ways of negotiating, building relationships, and imagining climate solutions that centre Indigenous communities, and protect and return to them the lands on which they depend. As the youth climate justice movement grows, attending to Indigenous priorities will help it transform, rather than reinforce, the systems at the root of climate crisis and to challenge existing policymaking structures.","[Grosse, Corrie] Coll St Benedict, St Joseph, MO 56374 USA; [Grosse, Corrie] St Johns Univ, Collegeville, MN 56321 USA; [Mark, Brigid] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Grosse, C (corresponding author), Coll St Benedict, St Joseph, MO 56374 USA.; Grosse, C (corresponding author), St Johns Univ, Collegeville, MN 56321 USA.",,,,,,,64,0,0,4,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

The volume forms part of the International Library of Policy Analysis series, which covers more than twenty countries, published by Policy Press and edited by Michael Howlett and Iris Geva-May. While various themes emerge from the Irish volume, this article focuses on only one core question: whether and how the 2008 economic crisis contracted and expanded the capacity for policy analysis in Ireland. The troika of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and the European Commission are associated with policy capacity innovation, but also with significant austerity. Both had a major and long-term impact on public services. While the article documents a range of successful post-bailout attempts to improve policy analysis capacity, it also points to often less conscious, but sometimes deliberate, decisions that diminished some forms of policy analysis capacity. We find economic policymaking capacity enhanced while changes to resources and policy opportunity structures depleted both space and the capacity for social policy analysis. This was particularly so within the equality and social justice sectors. Given ongoing social risks, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, Ireland needs to adjust for a future of permanent uncertainty, or perpetual crises, and should seek to rebalance investment in social policy capacity and to develop systems for integrated policy analysis.","[Murphy, Mary] Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Hogan, John] Technol Univ Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Murphy, M (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",0001-8325,2449-9471,,ADMINSTRATION,Administration,DEC,2020,68,4,,,,,145,160,,10.2478/admin-2020-0028,,,16,Public Administration,Public Administration,PP2KV,WOS:000605697300010,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-08-07,

These novel methods promise to augment public health operations by using ever larger and more robust health datasets combined with new tools for collecting and analyzing data. Precision strategies to protecting the public health could more effectively or efficiently address the systemic threats of climate change, but may also propagate or exacerbate health disparities for the populations most vulnerable in a changing climate. How PPH interventions collect and aggregate data, decide what to measure, and analyze data pose potential issues around privacy, neglecting social determinants of health, and introducing algorithmic bias into climate responses. Adopting a health justice framework, guided by broader social and climate justice tenets, can reveal principles and policy actions which may guide more responsible implementation of PPH in climate responses.","[Johnson, Walter G.] Arizona State Univ, Sandra Day OConnor Coll Law, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Johnson, WG (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sandra Day OConnor Coll Law, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,"Johnson, Walter/0000-0001-6359-2312",,,,86,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1073-1105,1748-720X,,J LAW MED ETHICS,J.

The capability approach is a normative framework for assessing people's well-being and devising interventions for social justice. Whilst recognising that opposition to energy technologies is fundamentally a problem of distributive, recognition and procedural injustices, the paper operationalises the capability approach to unveil what these justice tenets mean to indigenous people living in three communities neighbouring wind installations located in Southern Mexico. Findings conclude that building a bottom-up approach to understand complex conceptions of energy justice within a community can lead to an improved awareness of justice implications relevant to community acceptance of energy technologies. In the Mexican case, these factors relate to inclusive community engagement that pays particular attention to valued ways of being and doing of the local population, such as equal access to employment, higher education and professional training, diversified sources of income, and recognition of the local indigenous everyday life and communal identity. The results also highlight a nested structure of justice concerns, with the three tenets being embedded into one another and presenting different levels of visibility.","[Velasco-Herrejon, Paola] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England; [Bauwens, Thomas] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a,Room 0, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands","Velasco-Herrejon, P (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England.",Pv296@cam.ac.uk; t.j.f.bauwens@uu.nl,,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia Mexico, CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [469917]","The lead author received a scholarship from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia Mexico, CONACYT (CVU No. 469917).

In particular, the emerging calls for 'food sovereignty' (FS) and 'migrate with dignity' (MWD) show how most vulnerable groups from the Global South, i.e. small-scale farmers and inhabitants of small Pacific islands, respond to deteriorating environments by claiming universal and emancipatory rights 'from below'. These contestations show that the struggle over land is tied not only to the potential loss of physical resources but also to the struggle over cultural and political sovereignty, as well as to the emergence of post-national forms of citizenship. In drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Bolivia and Kiribati, where these claims-FS in the former case, MWD in the latter - are currently being negotiated and fought over, this contribution aims to sketch a 'geography of emerging rights' to make transnational politico-legal responses to environmental injustice visible and understandable. Conceptually, it draws on the assumption that, by now, environmental justice research has paid too little attention to the sphere of 'the legal', and that conversely, legal geography research has been reluctant to analyze dimensions of law and social order within deteriorating environments. This contribution thus discusses analytical entry points from legal geography, legal anthropology, and political theory in order to bring these disciplines into dialogue with empirically grounded research on movements struggling for land and sovereignty.","[Fladvad, Benno] Univ Hamburg, Humanities Ctr Adv Studies Futures Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany; [Klepp, Silja; Duenckmann, Florian] Univ Kiel, Inst Geog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Fladvad, B (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Humanities Ctr Adv Studies Futures Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany.",benno.fladvad@uni-hamburg.de; klepp@geographie.uni-kiel.de; duenckmann@geographie.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,91,1,1,7,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,DEC,2020,117,,,,,,80,89,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.09.007,,,10,Geography,Geography,OW5FL,WOS:000592912200009,,,,,2021-08-07,

SF has evolved from early aims of empowerment and devolution of rights advocated by global reform movements, and is now reframed in the market ideal as a win-win-win endeavor for sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation and robust entrepreneurial livelihoods. Southeast Asian states have formulated numerous standardized SF programs and policies that are often linked to broader development goals and priorities, but which have not always been a 'win' for local communities in falling short to provide full tenure rights. Civil society organizations that have provided grounded perspectives on environmental justice and rights have also converged with states on entrepreneurship and market-based solutions. Meanwhile, the private sector actor that is seen as key to these solutions is conspicuously absent within the SF policy space. Within this space of diverse and at times contradictory objectives, whose interests do SF policies serve? We examine the social forestry assemblage to investigate the different discourses, interests and agendas in the implementation of SF schemes in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Malaysian state of Sabah. The formal SF schemes involve shifting or reinforcing old discourses around forest problems and possible solutions, territorialization processes that can lead to inequities in the exclusion of rights, participation and access, and risks exacerbating contestations and inequities in claims to forest land and resources.","[Wong, Grace Y.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Moeliono, Moira; Bong, Indah W.; Thuy Thu Pham] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Jalan CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Sahide, Muhammad A.

Our review included empirical and modeling studies that examined a range of climate change mitigation measures, with health-related outcomes analyzed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Data were extracted from published reports and summarized. We identified 36 studies that examined a diverse set of policy instruments, with the majority located in high-income countries. Most studies employed conventional Western research methodologies, and few examined potential impacts of particular relevance to Indigenous peoples. The existing body of knowledge is limited in the extent to which it can provide definitive evidence about co-benefits and co-harms for Indigenous health, with impacts highly dependent on individual policy characteristics and contextual factors.

Using a text analysis of Facebook pages for 144 campaigns at higher education institutions (HEIs), this article presents an overview and analysis of the characteristics of the higher education (HE) FFD movement in the US. The results indicate that campaigns occur at a wide array of HEIs, concentrated on the east and west coasts. Primarily student led, campaigns set broad goals for divestment, while reinvestment is often a less clearly defined objective. Campaigns incorporate a mixture of environmental, social, and economic arguments into their messaging. Justice is a common theme, used often in a broad context rather than towards specific populations or communities impacted by climate change or other social issues. These insights contribute to the understanding of the HE FFD movement as ten years of campus organizing approaches. In particular, this study illustrates how the movement is pushing sustainability and climate action in HE and in broader society towards a greater focus on systemic change and social justice through campaigns' hardline stance against fossil fuels and climate justice orientation.","[Gibson, Dylan; Duram, Leslie A.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Earth Syst & Sustainabil, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Gibson, D (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Earth Syst & Sustainabil, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",djgibson4@siu.edu; duram@siu.edu,,,,,,83,0,0,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,23,,,,,,,10069,10.3390/su122310069,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PD2BR,WOS:000597497400001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

We find that (1) Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy and mitigation projects are as conflictive as FF projects, and that both disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities and Indigenous peoples. Amongst LCE projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.","[Temper, Leah; Kosoy, Nicolas] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Avila, Sofia; Del Bene, Daniela; Martinez-Alier, Joan; Roy, Brototi; Scheidel, Arnim; Walter, Mariana] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gobby, Jennifer] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Le Billon, Philippe] Univ British Columbia, Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Perkins, Patricia] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada","Temper, L (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",leah.temper@gmail.com,"Del Bene, Daniela/AAU-2500-2021; Scheidel, Arnim/C-3105-2018","Del Bene, Daniela/0000-0002-7879-5275; Scheidel, Arnim/0000-0001-9764-685X; Martinez-Alier, Joan/0000-0002-6124-539X; Le Billon, Philippe/0000-0002-4635-2998",International Social Science Council [TKN150317115354]; 'EnvJustice' project - European Research Council (ERC) [GA 695446]; Leadership for the Ecozoic program; Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral programme of the Government of Catalonia's Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Economy and Knowledge [2017 BP 00023]; Government of Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council,"This paper has received funding from the International Social Science Council for the ACKnowl-EJ project (TKN150317115354), the 'EnvJustice' project (GA 695446), funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Leadership for the Ecozoic program.

Methods: Using Hazus(R) Hurricane Model, disaster losses are calculated using data from the Houston metropolitan area and the 2008 historical storm event, Hurricane Ike. 2010 U.S. Census indicators quantify socioeconomic factors. GeoDa 1.14 open source software investigates nonrandom spatial clusters with exploratory spatial data analysis local Moran's I score to identify census tracts with high associated disaster losses and vulnerability. Results: We demonstrate the importance of adding disaster loss data with the spatial analysis of vulnerability factors, including race, median income, and poverty. A nonrandom spatial component was found within and between these variables, confirming place matters. The average loss rate shows an increase of the number of census tracts that had a higher proportion of loss regardless of income. Discussion: Incorporating historical disaster loss data into the model provides a better picture of vulnerable populations in the Houston metropolitan area. Disaster loss data is a crucial performance assessment technique that can effectively assess current approaches and compare the accuracy of other methods for identifying high-risk areas. Conclusion: Previous social vulnerability studies in metropolitan areas focus on disaster impacts and recovery operation outcomes or on susceptibility to natural hazards. Our study investigates both vulnerabilities: social and biophysical. This average loss rate shows loss in relation to income, highlighting the importance of standardizing data to compare census tracts that are disproportionately affected.","[Osiecki, Kristin M.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Learning Innovat, Rochester, MN USA; [Quinsey, Logan; Sambanis, Apostolis] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Emergency Management & Resilience Planning Grad C, 1603 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA","Quinsey, L (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Emergency Management & Resilience Planning Grad C, 1603 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",lquins2@uic.edu,,,,,,75,0,0,4,4,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Future UK feed barley supply was assessed under the influence of projected climate change, climate mitigation policy scenarios, and population growth. The results showed that land-based climate mitigation policies reduced land area for barley and created large deficits in supply. Using Algeria and Tunisia as exemplar global south countries that rely on barley supply from the United Kingdom and Europe for food and feed, the article concludes that pursuit of land-based mitigation policies, in the global north, which reduce the production of globally important food security crops, can create or amplify food vulnerabilities in the global south. Tunisia's imports, for example, are about 290% of domestic production. These countries need feed barley to maintain high domestic animal production for food and religious needs, which limit meat imports. The asymmetries in technical, economic, and political power between the global north and south imply that the latter could be outcompeted. In serving the climate justice principle of equitable sharing of burdens and benefits, the article argues that climate mitigation policies should address (not amplify) the uneven geographical and social impacts of climate change. This principle should be integral to the appraisal of public policies and actions on land-based climate mitigation policies and prioritized in climate justice discourse in a genuine global cooperative framework. This is as urgent as the need for climate mitigation action.","[Yawson, David Oscar] Univ West Indies, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies CERMES, Cave Hill Campus, BB-11000 Bridgetown, Barbados","Yawson, DO (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies CERMES, Cave Hill Campus, BB-11000 Bridgetown, Barbados.",david.yawson@cavehill.uwi.edu,,"Yawson, David/0000-0002-5771-4042","Centre for Environmental Change and Human Resilience (CECHR, University of Dundee); James Hutton Institute (Scotland); University of Cape Coast (Ghana)","This study was part of a PhD work sponsored by the Centre for Environmental Change and Human Resilience (CECHR, University of Dundee), The James Hutton Institute (Scotland), and the University of Cape Coast (Ghana).",,36,0,0,1,1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

At the agentic level, the analysis shows how these hegemonic conceptualizations and discourses affect dumpster divers and how an environmental ideological motivation contains an anticapitalistic ideological motivation. Building on my neo-Gramscian analysis, I highlight the potential threat that environmental discourses might stabilize neoliberal hegemony by offering appealing consent-structures and contain more fundamental, social justice-based, critique of the neoliberal social order. To preserve its inherently critical and counter-hegemonic potential, I develop a conceptual model of food waste and discuss its relevance for critical management and organization studies.","[Plank, Andreas] Tyrolean Private Univ UMIT, Hall In Tirol, Austria","Plank, A (corresponding author), Tyrolean Private Univ UMIT, Eduard Wallnofer Zentrum 1, A-6060 Hall In Tirol, Austria.",andreas.plank@umit.at,,"Plank, Andreas/0000-0002-6037-8692",,,,90,0,0,5,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,,,,,,,,,,,1.35051E+15,10.1177/1350508420973348,,DEC 2020,24,Management,Business & Economics,PF8TD,WOS:000599319000001,,,,,2021-08-07,

This paper analyses the effects of resettlement on the vulnerability of relocated rural communities in Mozambique, from the perspective of environmental justice. The research seeks to understand how land concessions interfere with autonomous processes of adaptation that are not recognised within land distribution policies. The findings draw on a qualitative field research in two locations, in the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, where levels of poverty have persisted despite national trends of economic growth. The paper highlights how climate events inflluence perceptions of fairness amongst resettled populations, and how resettlements constrain their adaptative capabilities. The findings raise concern that misrecognition of adaptation practices can exacerbate the vulnerability of households to environmental change and to food insecurity, thereby hindering the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG13 (Climate Action). The author argues for the centrality of recognition within environmental justice, while contributing recommendations to ensure that land deals fulfil principles of distributional and procedural justice, which take into consideration the compound pressures of land use changes and climate vulnerability.","[Gomes, Carla] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Av Prof Anibal Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal","Gomes, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Av Prof Anibal Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.",carla.gomes@ics.ulisboa.pt,"Gomes, Carla/P-3565-2015","Gomes, Carla/0000-0002-6089-0485",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/84785/2012],This work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [grant number SFRH/BD/84785/2012].,,44,1,1,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Additionally, we address issues of particular relevance for political philosophy, such as whether organized vegan consumer campaigns are a politically legitimate means to strive for structural change.

The current mixed-method study sought to explore this issue amongst a sample of social work students (N = 724) in the US. Overall, students mildly to moderately believe that environmental issues are part of practice, and regression results revealed that greater support was associated with the belief in climate change and completing a university course that included environmental injustice. Content analysis of an open-ended question that asked students to define 'environmental justice' revealed that students primarily defined this term within the context of general environmental harm (28%) and 15% linked this term to a disproportionate exposure to hazards among people who have been historically oppressed and marginalized. Together these results suggested that further educational efforts may be needed to expand students' knowledge of environmental (in)justice and how it is part of practice across the micro-macro continuum.","[Chonody, Jill M.] Boise State Univ, Social Work, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Sultzman, Vickey R.

It has, however, also been conceived as an ongoing gateway tactic to curb long-term climate change and simultaneously secure social and environmental justice. Divestment has attracted global attention and is currently employed by numerous universities, religious institutions, art galleries, museums, and national and local governments, in various countries, including Scotland. However academic analysis of the movement remains underdeveloped. This article addresses such absence by giving a voice to the motives, tactics, and rationales as expressed by campaigners themselves. It identifies the collective action frames constructed by Scottish fossil fuel divestment campaigns in order to facilitate mobilisation and alignment with other climate change movements. A key premise of this article is to also explore the power of such frames to motivate action and to assess the extent to which divestment campaign groups can impact government discourse and policy. As such the article concludes by considering whether and how far divestment frames and discourses may have come to inform the climate change policy of the devolved Scottish Government.","[Muncie, Ella] Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Muncie, E (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",em471@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,47,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

As climate actions reshape existing understandings of what cities are or ought to be, they constitute new modalities of what recent scholarship has referred to as 'climate urbanism'. This research has framed climate urbanism as a climate-inflected iteration of neoliberal urban development, geared towards the mobilization of 'green' private capital for large-scale infrastructural projects, focused on carbon metrics, and conducive to population displacement through eco-gentrification. In this intervention, we commend these efforts to deliver a critical perspective on how climate change gives rise to forms of urbanism that reproduce urban injustices without addressing the root causes of the climate crisis. However, we warn against two biases in recent scholarship, namely an emphasis on technological solutions and an overreliance on familiar contexts of climate action. The literature on climate urbanism does not yet reflect the diversity of urban responses emerging under the broad umbrella of urban climate action. Adopting a post-colonial perspective on climate urbanism, we call for a greater engagement with the heterogeneous character of climate-changed urban futures.","[Robin, Enora; Broto, Vanesa CastaN] Univ Sheffield, Urban Inst, ICOSS, 219 Portobello Rd, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England","Robin, E (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Urban Inst, ICOSS, 219 Portobello Rd, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.",e.robin@sheffield.ac.uk; v.castanbroto@sheffield.ac.uk,"Broto, Vanesa Castan/AAF-4485-2021",,Philip Leverhulme Prize,"We would like to thank the handling editor for editorial support throughout this process, as well as the three anonymous IJURR reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

The normative frame of climate justice as conceived in academia, policy arenas, and grassroots action, although imperative and growing in popularity across climate movements, is no longer adequate to address this emergency. This is for two reasons: first, as a framing for the problem, current notions of climate justice are insufficient to overcome the persistent silencing of voices belonging to multiple others; and second, they do not question, and thus implicitly condone, human exceptionalism and the violence it enacts, historically and in this era of the Anthropocene. Therefore, we advocate for the concept of multispecies justice to enrich climate justice in order to more effectively confront the climate crisis. The advantage of reconceptualizing climate justice in this way is that it becomes more inclusive; it acknowledges the differential histories and practices of social, environmental, and ecological harm, while opening just pathways into uncertain futures. A multispecies justice lens expands climate justice by decentering the human and by recognizing the everyday interactions that bind individuals and societies to networks of close and distant others, including other people and more-than-human beings. Such a relational lens provides a vital scientific, practical, material, and ethical road map for navigating the complex responsibilities and politics in the climate crisis. Most importantly, it delineates what genuine flourishing could mean, what systemic transformations may involve (and with whom), how to live with inevitable and possibly intolerable losses, and how to prefigure and enact alternative and just futures.

The purpose of this research is to understand how government policy impacts social work practice in non-government organisations in Aotearoa New Zealand. How NGO social workers apply and maintain ethical principles and standards in the current socio-economic climate was explored. The study aimed to increase understanding of how NGO social workers remain dedicated to the pursuit of social justice and social change in their day-to-day practice, within conflicting policy environments and the government's social investment approach. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative research methodology informed by a constructivist epistemology was adopted as the research strategy for this study. The interest was in exploring personal perspectives so qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out with five experienced NGO social work practitioners. FINDINGS: Thematic analysis of the research data found that contemporary NGO social work is a practice characterised by a sense of powerlessness. From this sense of powerlessness, five sub-themes were identified: freedom and powerlessness; the application of the principle of social justice at a macro level; professional dissonance; issues of funding and resourcing constraints as a result of neoliberal economic policy; and finally, different realities and a notion of othering. CONCLUSION: This research found that the social justice element of social work practice may be at risk should the dominant neoliberal social policy environment remain in existence.","[Price, Ashleigh] Whitireia Community Polytech, Aotearoa, New Zealand; Wellington Inst Technol, Aotearoa, New Zealand","Price, A (corresponding author), Whitireia Community Polytech, Aotearoa, New Zealand.",ashleigh.price@whitireia.ac.nz,,,,,,59,0,0,0,0,AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND ASSOC SOCIAL WORKERS,CHRISTCHURCH,"DX BOX WX33484, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",2463-4131,,,AOTEAROA N Z SOC WOR,AOTEAROA N.

According to (Edwards 2011) the resultant or consequent problems in the environment could reach levels that could push the planet to levels of ecological disaster. Evidence of ecosystem destruction, human induced climate change, social injustice and increasing economic strife is mounting in many parts of the world. Environmental Education (EE) has often been mentioned as an important response to the issues mentioned above, but if EE is to contribute to the transformation to sustainable living, teachers have a vital role to play. Thus, teacher education programmes need to prepare preservice adequately for these challenges arising in the 21st century. This exploratory theoretical article reviews approaches and ideas for the development of curriculum for environment related education in teacher education programmes. I draw on the work of Short (2002) related to place based collaborative knowledge production and Jickling and Wals (2008), active and co-operative learning in context, to inform curriculum development possibilities for EE. The research highlights the importance of active participation for meaningful environmental learning and presents arguments for including local environmental issues and knowledge development during the practicum as key activities to enable meaningful environmental learning and social justice in teacher education programmes.","[Reddy, C.] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum Studies, Stellenbosch, South Africa","Reddy, C (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum Studies, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",cpsr@sun.ac.za,,,,,,35,0,0,1,1,SUNJOURNALS,STELLENBOSCH,"STELLENBOSCH UNIV LIB & INFORMATION SERV, PRIVATE BAG X5036, STELLENBOSCH, 7599, SOUTH AFRICA",1011-3487,1753-5913,,S AFR J HIGH EDUC,"S.

The intercountry and intergenerational equities are discussed and found, for the first, in terms of equal cumulated per capita emissions, for the second, both in terms of temperature growth control and capacity to ensure an equal future yearly amount of emission per generation. These definitions allow enquiring which country is behaving fairly and, consequently, which system may be introduced to compensate.

Native American groups located in the Gulf Coast Region of the United States are particularly vulnerable to environmental justice issues such as climate change and oil spills due to their geographic location and reliance on the coastal region for economic and social resources. This study used the framework of historical oppression, resilience, and transcendence (FHORT) to explore the historic and contemporary forms of environmental injustice experienced by a Native American tribe in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. This critical ethnography analyzed a series of individual, family, and focus group semi-structured qualitative interviews with a total of 208 participants. Following the critical ethnographic method, data were interpreted through reconstructive analysis using NVivo. Findings of this study reveal the continuing impact of the BP oil spill and tfifficulty accessing resources following the spill, complicated by the tribe's lack of federal recognition. Additional themes include the continuing impact of coastal erosion, historical and contemporary land loss, geographic marginalization, and concerns about a loss of tribal identity when tribal members are forced to relocate. Lack of federal tribal recognition has exacerbated all of these issues for this tribe. This study supports national findings that Native American groups experience extensive historic and contemporary environmental injustices and contextualizes these findings for a Native American tribe in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Recognizing Native American sovereignty is key to addressing the environmental justice issues described.","[Liddell, Jessica L.; Mckinley, Catherine E.] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Lilly, Jennifer M.] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA","Mckinley, CE (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Sch Social Work, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",catmckinley@tulanc.edu,,,Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation Faculty Grant Program [552745]; Silberman Fund Faculty Grant Program [552781]; Newcomb College Institute Faculty Grant at Tulane University; University Senate Committee on Research Grant Program at Tulane University; Global South Research Grant through the New Orleans Center for the Gulf South at Tulane University; Center for Public Service at Tulane University; Office of Research Bridge Funding Program Support at Tulane University; Carol Lavin Bernick Research Grant at Tulane University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health [K12HD043451]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U54 GM104940]; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA028201],"The authors are thankful for the dedicated work and participation of the tribes and research assistants over the years who have contributed to this work.

Our motivation for this study is to ensure that renewable energy policies incorporate concerns for justice into their formulation and implementation. We provide a systematic review of the literature assessing renewable energy technologies from the perspective of distributive, procedural, recognition, and capability interpretations of environmental justice. Our review finds that there are ten common renewable energy technologies that have EJ implications documented in the current literature, and that future energy transition policy development needs to ensure these justice concerns are addressed.","[Levenda, A.

Farmers' groups and civil society organisations have been mobilising legal and extra-legal tactics to gain discrete legal responses from the state towards guaranteeing farmers' fundamental rights in the context of climate change adaptation to droughts in semi-arid parts of rural India. This paper discusses the strategies used by such actors to frame the contours of climate justice. The movement highlights the need for India's policies to align with transformational, procedural and distributional justice goals that recognise and redress structural (socio-economic, cultural, colonial) roots of vulnerability towards just and sustainable adaptation processes. It also highlights the responsibility of the nation-state to safeguard the fundamental/constitutional rights of farmers who contribute to the nation's food security while being the most vulnerable to climate impacts at sub-national scales.","[Chaudhuri, Nairita Roy] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law Sch, Dept Publ Law & Governance, Tilburg, Netherlands","Chaudhuri, NR (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law Sch, Dept Publ Law & Governance, Tilburg, Netherlands.",N.RoyChaudhuri@tilburguniversity.edu,,,European Joint Doctorate in Law and Development,"This article is part of a bigger project to explore how and to what extent community knowledge helps in framing climate change-adaptation laws and policies to counter drought in rural India, funded by the European Joint Doctorate in Law and Development.

Along with sustainability, issues of justice are crucial in this context including climate justice, which addresses the most notorious phenomenon of the transition to the Anthropocene, i.e. climate change. Such a paradigm shift implies the need to go beyond established practices in research and exploring new narratives. This paper develops a possible narrative of the civilizational patterns that led to the human transformation of the planet, and shows the limits of business-as-usual responses to confronting the global crisis brought about by the geological transition, and consequently their limited ability to achieve sustainability and justice in the Anthropocene. The narrative deployed here highlights the centrality of a particular form of vision in Modernity and its contribution to the establishment of hierarchies through the di-vision between the in-di-vidual and the external world, i.e. nature, which is untenable in the Anthropocene.","[Jaria-Manzano, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Constitut & Environm Law, Catalonia, Spain","Jaria-Manzano, J (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Constitut & Environm Law, Catalonia, Spain.",jordi.jaria@urv.cat,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [DER2016-80011-P],"This work has been carried out in the context of the project Global Climate Constitution: Governance and law in a complex context, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness for the three-year period 2017-2019 (DER2016-80011-P; main researchers: Jordi Jaria-Manzano and Susana Borras Pentinat).",,141,0,0,1,1,ONATI INT INST SOCIOLOGY LAW,ONATI,"ANTIGUA UNIV S-N, APARTADO 28, ONATI, SPAIN",,2079-5971,,ONATI SOCIO-LEGAL S,Onati Socio-Legal Ser.,,2021,11,1,,,,,148,179,,10.35295/OSLS.IISL/0000-0000-0000-1176,,,32,Law,Government & Law,QE0JJ,WOS:000615893600006,,gold,,,2021-08-07,

The integration of a specific climate goal-SDG 13 - into the SDGs is paramount as climate change is a global and urgent threat compromising the realisation of all the SDGs. However, the SDGs' focus on issues linked to the current economic growth pattern and development paradigm may prevent them from addressing the climate crisis and the inequalities and injustices associated with it.

However, little research explores how settler colonialism and historical oppression contribute to the physical transformation of land, and how this undermines tribal members' health.

A qualitative description research methodology was used to conduct 31 life-history interviews with women from a Gulf Coast Indigenous tribe. Findings of this study reveal that central components of reproductive justice, including the ability to have children and the ability to raise children in safe and healthy environments, are undermined by environmental justice issues in the community. Among concerns raised by women were high rates of chronic healthcare issues among community members, and issues with infertility.

However, major innovation breakthroughs can trigger profound and disruptive changes, leading to simultaneous and interlinked reconfigurations of multiple parts of the global food system. The emergence of new technologies or social solutions, therefore, have very different impact profiles, with favourable consequences for some SDGs and unintended adverse side-effects for others. Stand-alone innovations seldom achieve positive outcomes over multiple sustainability dimensions. Instead, they should be embedded as part of systemic changes that facilitate the implementation of the SDGs. Emerging trade-offs need to be intentionally addressed to achieve true sustainability, particularly those involving social aspects like inequality in its many forms, social justice, and strong institutions, which remain challenging.

We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is warranted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This is attributed to lack of exposure in climate change issues during training as social workers leading to lack of adequate tools for social workers to integrate climate change issues into their day-to-day interventions with clients. This paper is aimed at providing guidelines for social work practice in mainstreaming the participation of rural women in the climate change discourse. Social workers and rural women are absent from climate change interventions at professional, practice and personal levels. The precarious impacts of climate change manifesting through floods, droughts, water scarcity, depletion of the natural resource base, cyclones and heat waves disproportionally affect women particularly those in rural communities. Women's vulnerability to climate change is emanating from exclusion in climate change decision-making processes, cultural norms and patterns which confines them to household responsibilities, lack of adaptive capacity, low literacy levels, patriarchal dominance and high poverty levels. As such, social workers are required to enhance social change, through empowerment and liberation of women to participate in discussions on climate change like men. A model is presented based on experiences in southern Africa to provide some guidance for social workers on how best to mainstream gender dimensions in climate change interventions. This would foster social and environmental justice, social resilience, equal participation in the climate change discourse, capacity building and adaptive capacity for rural women.","[Nyahunda, Louis] Univ Limpopo, Dept Social Work, Limpopo, South Africa","Nyahunda, L (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Social Work, Limpopo, South Africa.",nyahundalouis@gmail.com,,"Nyahunda, Louis/0000-0002-9352-4115",,,,67,1,1,8,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2365-1792,,,J HUM RIGHTS SOC WOR,J.

Other avenues, such as litigation, have emerged as a policy tool for seeking redress for past and prospective harm resulting from climate change. The academic and policy literatures have, however, had limited engagement with the role of rights-based litigation in climate governance since Paris. We help fill this gap by developing the four-component OATH (Objective, Associated climate impact, Type of justice, Harm) framework and applying it to three high-profile climate litigation cases - Urgenda v. The Netherlands, Juliana v. United States, and Demanda v. Minambiente. Our analysis confirms that the progress and achievements of these cases demonstrate the potential of climate litigation to force greater national and sub-national government action on climate change. However, litigation better serves some types of justice (e.g. intergenerational) than others (e.g. distributive). Therefore, as its ambition and progress continue to grow, litigation must be combined with other forms of climate action to better advance justice in a post-Paris world. Key policy insights International climate agreements and obligations are important to the success of climate litigation. Climate litigation can be used to hold countries accountable to the commitments they communicate in their NDCs and other policy instruments, but it should be used as one of several policy tools. Litigation pertaining to climate adaptation should and can be expanded to support and advance justice. Distributive justice cannot be sufficiently advanced through domestic climate litigation so it must be further incorporated into international climate agreements and obligations. The universal right to a clean environment, its definition and criteria should be (a) established in international environmental agreements and obligations, and (b) aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.","[Beauregard, Charles; Carlson, D'Arcy; Robinson, Stacy-ann; Cobb, Charles; Patton, Mykela] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA","Robinson, SA (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Mayflower Hill Dr, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",stacy-ann.robinson@colby.edu,,"Robinson, Stacy-ann/0000-0003-3163-8771",,,,90,1,1,12,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

In Australia, the term gained traction during the 2019-2020 'Black Summer' bushfires. The (un)natural disaster prompted local governments, industries, peak bodies and academic collectives to 'declare' a climate emergency and call for immediate action on climate change. We note, however, that there has been no declaration from geographers in Australia. As a discipline whose members are embedded in research, teaching and advocacy about climate change - and the interlinked crises of biodiversity loss and environmental and social justice - we found this surprising. It is self-evident that climate change matters to geographers. So, is a declaration of a climate emergency from the discipline necessary? In writing this piece we reflect on our experiences of the 2019-2020 summer and conversations with fellow geographers, to consider what a declaration of an emergency does, who it is for and what actions it might mobilise. In conclusion, we call on geographers in Australia to declare an emergency which foregrounds the interlinked crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and social (in)justice. The detail of what this declaration says and means in practice is open for discussion. We ask many questions throughout this paper as a way to invite you - our fellow geographers - to join us in this conversation.","[Wilkinson, Carrie] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Wilkinson, Carrie; Clement, Susannah] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space ACCES, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Wilkinson, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.; Wilkinson, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Culture Environm Soc & Space ACCES, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cw979@uowmail.edu.au,,"Wilkinson, Carrie/0000-0001-9336-6332","Geographical Society of New South Wales; Australian Centre for Culture, Environment, Society and Space (ACCESS)","We would like to acknowledge that this paper was written on the unceded Aboriginal lands of the Dharawal, Wadi Wadi and Yuin peoples of the greater Wollongong region and the Burramattagal and Darug peoples of the Parramatta area.

However, previous research has found EH education to be largely lacking in U.S. medical education, putting future physicians at risk of not having the expertise to address patients' environmental illnesses, nor speak to prevention.MethodsEnvironmental health (EH) knowledge and skills were incorporated into the first-year medical school curriculum at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine (Nutley, New Jersey), via a two-hour interactive large group learning module with follow up activities. Students completed the Environmental Health in Med School (EHMS) survey before and after the year 1 EH module. This survey evaluates medical students' attitudes, awareness and professionalism regarding environmental health. In year 2, students completed the Environmental Health Survey II, which measured students' perceptions of preparedness to discuss EH with future patients. The research team created both surveys based upon learning objectives that broadly aligned with the Institute of Medicine six competency-based environmental health learning objectives.Results36year 1 students completed both the pre and post EHMS surveys. McNemar's test was used for paired comparisons. Results identified no statistically significant changes from pre to post surveys, identifying a dramatic ceiling.When comparing year 2, EHS II pre-survey (n=84) and post-survey (n=79) responses, a statistically significant positive change in students' self-reported sense of preparedness to discuss environmental health with their patients following the curriculum intervention was noted.ConclusionsOur conclusion for the EHMS in Year 1 was that the current generation of medical students at this school is already extremely aware of and concerned about the impact of environmental issues on health.Through the EHS II in Year 2, we found that the six-week environmental health module combining didactic and experiential elements significantly increased medical students' self-reported sense of preparedness to discuss environmental health issues, including climate change, with their patients.","[Kligler, Benjamin; Ihde, Erin Speiser] Hackensack Univ, Med Ctr, Deirdre Imus Environm Hlth Ctr, Hackensack, NJ 07601 USA; [Zipp, Genevieve Pinto] Seton Hall Univ, Dept Interprofess Hlth Sci & Hlth Adm, Sch Hlth & Med Sci, Nutley, NJ USA; [Rocchetti, Carmela] Hackensack Meridian Sch Med, Nutley, NJ USA; [Secic, Michelle] Secic Stat Consulting Inc, Chardon, OH USA","Ihde, ES (corresponding author), Hackensack Univ, Med Ctr, Deirdre Imus Environm Hlth Ctr, Hackensack, NJ 07601 USA.",erin.ihde@hmhn.org,,"Ihde, Erin/0000-0002-3306-0873",,,,18,0,0,6,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6920,,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

Tools and programs to quantify and mitigate environmental injustices are limited by existing data, which may not capture the full range of health disparities exacerbated by the complex interactions between environmental exposures and social stressors. In this study, we analyzed how the scientific literature approaches EJ issues in the USA. We searched PubMed for journal articles discussing at least one sociodemographic or environmental variable in the context of cumulative impacts and analyzed the relative frequency with which various EJ topics were studied. Our findings indicate that demographic variables are commonly used in epidemiologic studies, though some areas (e.g., age) are better studied than others. Similarly, occupational exposure and ambient air pollution were more studied than other types of exposures. Word frequency analyses revealed which toxicants and health outcomes are the most frequently studied. In addition, temporality analyses showed that the rate of occupational publications rose rapidly in the 1970-1980s and has since plateaued, while other publication rates increased two decades later and are still on the rise. Cumulative impacts are considered in a relatively small portion of journal articles across all topics; nevertheless, they have seen an exponential climb in the last decade. A more equitable distribution of scientific efforts might be needed for a better distribution of funding, policy-making efforts, and other resources to socially and environmentally vulnerable communities.","[Smith, Audrey] PSE Hlth Energy, Oakland, CA USA; [Laribi, Ouahiba] Calif Environm Protect Agcy, Off Environm Hlth Hazard Assessment, Oakland, CA 94610 USA","Laribi, O (corresponding author), Calif Environm Protect Agcy, Off Environm Hlth Hazard Assessment, Oakland, CA 94610 USA.",ouahiba.laribi@oehha.ca.gov,,,,,,50,0,0,11,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2197-3792,2196-8837,,J RACIAL ETHN HEALTH,J.

Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11% of the world's land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields.

Building on the concepts of 'political opportunities' and 'rural democratization' to understand how rural politics is relevant to national regime changes in the process of deepening democracy, this paper argues that scaling up beyond the local level becomes necessary to counter the concentration of power at higher levels. At the same time, this vertical process is inextricable from building horizontal networks and rooting struggles in communities. By looking at national-level land policy advocacy for more just land laws, accountability politics in mining at a regional level in the southern Tanintharyi region, and the bottom-up establishment of local indigenous territories, this paper illustrates how expanding these struggles becomes necessary, but is also accompanied by potential fault-lines. These fault-lines include divergent political tendencies within the network and challenges to working in areas contested by the Burmese state and ethnic armed organizations.","[Sekine, Yukari] Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands","Sekine, Y (corresponding author), Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",sekine@iss.nl,,,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); United Kingdom Department for International Development (DfID),"The research and thoughts behind this paper have benefitted from the MOSAIC Project: 'Climate change mitigation policies, land grabbing and conflict in fragile states: understanding intersections, exploring transformations in Myanmar and Cambodia', funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), and by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DfID).",,85,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-6150,1743-9361,,J PEASANT STUD,J.

Since 2005, the area has experienced more than two dozen hurricanes with major rainstorms in between. Cemeteries, although just as vulnerable to storms and cancer-causing chemicals as the local population and natural environment, are overlooked casualties of frequent hurricanes and plant siting. During hurricanes and annual flooding, cemeteries in South Louisiana sustain significant damage such as dislodged coffins, difficult to reintern remains, and burial records damaged or destroyed. African American cemeteries are vulnerable to climate change impacts such as flooding, are often inaccessible, undocumented, and rarely recognized as environmental justice concerns, until now. Recently, environmental justice activists have mobilized to resist a Formosa plant's siting close to a historic black cemetery in St James Parish. The authors hypothesized that the Formosa siting is not an isolated case but instead reflects a pattern of racialized multihazard exposure of African American people and cemeteries. They created a database of cemetery locations-many of which were previously unmapped-based on the race or ethnicity of those interred in two parishes. Then, they performed a spatial analysis comparing cemeteries' exposure to flood hazards and proximity to hazardous chemical sites based on racial makeup. Findings show that black cemeteries have more multihazard exposure than other cemeteries due to accessibility and flooding. Results indicate that racialized multihazard exposure of cemeteries should be an emerging concern of Gulf Coast disaster recovery planners and researchers.","[Blanks, Jennifer; Abuabara, Alexander; Semien, Joy] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Roberts, Andrea] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Architecture, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Blanks, J (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",jenrblanks@gmail.com,"Roberts, Andrea/U-3097-2017","Roberts, Andrea/0000-0001-9979-6026",,,,51,0,0,3,3,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

A predominant approach to vulnerability assessment is indicator-based, wherein variables are aggregated to assess the vulnerability of units in a system (e.g., neighborhoods in a city). Here we show that a particular evidence-based predictive statistics approach can address two shortcomings of the most commonly-used indicator-based approach: lack of a means of validation and problematic weighting of individual indicators. We demonstrate how robust evidence-based models can produce frameworks that overcome these limitations. Using the case study of Hurricane Sandy in the State of New Jersey, we conducted two-pronged validated vulnerability assessments, based on insurance claim payouts and assistance grants. The latter needs-based assessment shows that Minorities are substantially more vulnerable than others based on a significant negative association with assistance approval rate (approved claims divided by all claims). Our findings highlight issues discussed in the literature within the context of climate justice and equity. Such an approach is helpful locally, but also when adaptation plans are developed over broad scales of time and space considering disparities between regions or across multiple jurisdictions.","[Barankin, Ram A.; Kirshen, Paul; Bowen, Robert E.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Portman, Michelle E.] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel","Barankin, RA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",ram.barankin@gmail.com,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

We review how this narrative is being used to promote securitization policies and to limit migration avenues. We propose a reinterpretation of this connection by drawing on its current critique and acknowledging the alternative conclusions that emerge from local perceptions of climate change. We explore human development perspectives to demonstrate how context-specific power structures and the politics behind the causes of (non-)migration, inhibit the freedom of choice by individuals and households over possible migratory decisions under changing climate threats and dangers. To achieve the well-being and social justice necessary for individuals to cope with the conditions of (non-)climate change, we conclude that current development aspirations must shift focus from human capital to human capability.","[Santos, Claudia; Mourato, Joao Morais] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Ave Prof Anibal Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal","Santos, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Ave Prof Anibal Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.",claudia.santos@ics.ulisboa.pt,"Mourato, Joao/AAS-8213-2020","Mourato, Joao/0000-0003-0891-4897; Santos, Claudia/0000-0002-0800-8272","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [7/2019/NT-GH-01, PD/BD/135351/2017]","This work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [grant number 7/2019/NT-GH-01,PD/BD/135351/2017].",,131,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.","[Zang, Sheryl M.] SUNY Downstate Coll Hlth Sci & Nursing, Sch Nursing, New York, NY USA; [Zang, Sheryl M.; Benjenk, Ivy; Breakey, Suellen; Pusey-Reid, Eleonor; Nicholas, Patrice K.] MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Ctr Climate Change Climate Justice & Hlth, Sch Nursing, Boston, MA 02129 USA; Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA","Nicholas, PK (corresponding author), MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Ctr Climate Change Climate Justice & Hlth, Sch Nursing, Boston, MA 02129 USA.",Nicholas.patrice@mgh.harvard.edu,,,,,,40,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0737-1209,1525-1446,,PUBLIC HEALTH NURS,Public Health Nurs.,MAR,2021,38,2,,,,,321,335,,10.1111/phn.12866,,JAN 2021,15,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nursing","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nursing",RO1FS,WOS:000613194000001,33521994,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2021-08-07,

This paper explores some of the implications of this requirement by examining the case of a proposed new independent coal-fired power producing plant, Khanyisa, in the province of Mpumalanga from the perspective of complexity studies, an emerging transdisciplinary field. Complexity thinking re-casts the Khanyisa project in a whole-system view, encouraging an active consideration of scale, perspectives, different knowledges, and cumulative impacts. In so doing, tensions both between and within dimensions of climate mitigation and development are quickly revealed, a complexity which is theorised in complexity studies as the raw material for systemic transformation. This whole-system conceptualisation also undermines incremental and relative arguments that Khanyisa mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the complex systemic property of non-linearity suggests that the Khanyisa decision is more significant than its power generation capacity indicates. Attention to the conceptual simplification inherent in 'development' highlights what is lost through such simplification, as well as what is gained, and by whom. Finally, complexity thinking foregrounds the multiple scales at which the systemic climate mitigation and development implications of Khanyisa play out. Currently there is very little policy-making capacity nationally, regionally or in eMalahleni to look at alternatives, or 'spaces of possibility' through the complexity lens for both development and climate mitigation. This case argues that new policy processes are needed, which go far beyond policy and regulatory processes steeped in path dependencies and incrementalism.","[Tyler, E.] Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, Cape Town, South Africa; [Tyler, E.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Inst, Cape Town, South Africa; [Cohen, B.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Chem Engn, Cape Town, South Africa","Tyler, E (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, Cape Town, South Africa.; Tyler, E (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Inst, Cape Town, South Africa.",emily.tyler@uct.ac.za,,"Tyler, Emily/0000-0001-9342-7289; Cohen, Brett/0000-0003-2837-3768",,,,44,0,0,2,2,"UNIV CAPE TOWN, ENERGY RES CENTRE",CAPE TOWN,"LIBRARY RD, MENZIES BLDG, 6TH FLR ROOM 6 41 PRIVATE BAG X3, RONDEBOSCH, CAPE TOWN, WESTERN CAPE 7701, SOUTH AFRICA",1021-447X,,,J ENERGY SOUTH AFR,J.

We utilise an intersectional subjectivities lens and the notion of 'negotiated resilience' as proposed by Harris and colleagues (2018) to assess the inner workings of power and agency in rural Ghanaian farming communities. Specifically, we demonstrate how new entryways for contesting and deliberating power relations can be opened, or conversely closed, within participatory arenas, here during three co-learning workshops on gender and climate change adaptation. Such insights are valuable for researchers and social actors alike to create mindful and practical spaces for (re)negotiating gendered inequalities, as a vital step toward transference into everyday realities. Ultimately, we argue that persistent and collaborative efforts at subverting and (re)negotiating inequitable processes of power in specific contexts is crucial for creating meaningful pathways toward climate justice.","[Garcia, Alicea; Tschakert, Petra] Univ Western Australia UWA, Fac Arts Business Law & Educ, Dept Geog & Planning, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Karikari, Nana Afia] Univ Cape Coast UCC, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Mariwah, Simon] Univ Cape Coast UCC, Fac Social Sci, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Bosompem, Martin] Univ Cape Coast UCC, Sch Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Cape Coast, Ghana","Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia UWA, Fac Arts Business Law & Educ, Dept Geog & Planning, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",alicea.garcia@research.uwa.edu.au; petra.tschakert@uwa.edu.au; smariwah@ucc.edu.gh; mbosompem@ucc.edu.gh,,"Tschakert, Petra/0000-0002-4268-3378","University of Western Australia (UWA); Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science",This work was supported by The University of Western Australia (UWA); and an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.,,93,0,0,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,FEB,2021,119,,,,,,190,205,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.09.018,,,16,Geography,Geography,RO4JM,WOS:000641011300019,,,,,2021-08-07,

Activism around social justice, equality, and identity is transforming society, media, and campuses. In this super-charged climate and context, the stakes involved in courses that examine the interplay between race, gender, and media are high. Diversity initiatives have been a formal part of the accrediting process for journalism programs since the 1980s, and race, gender, and media courses are elective or required in many programs. This article, based on in-depth interviews with 11 seasoned instructors - many of whom had careers in the media professions before turning to the classroom - finds that these instructors contest the value of traditional objectivity in upper-level journalism courses, but they have not thoroughly embraced advocacy, either. Instructor race and gender identity, student body diversity, as well as instructor rank, all have an impact on the instructors' perception of vulnerability or freedom to teach this sensitive material. Instructors of these courses experience individual, interpersonal, and structural tensions regarding the objectivity/advocacy balance in their classrooms. Since individual-level tensions may be a sign of healthy introspection, resolution may not be necessary. Suggestions for managing interpersonal tensions specific to race, gender, and media classrooms are offered. It is also recommended that the inherent structural tensions are taken into account in promotion and tenure decisions.","[Peuchaud, Sheila Rose] Univ Nevada, Reno Reynolds Sch Journalism, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Peuchaud, SR (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Mail Stop 310, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",speuchaud@unr.edu,,,,,,61,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,FEB,2021,22,2,,,,,519,536,,10.1177/1464884918779943,,,18,Communication,Communication,QR8PM,WOS:000625475100014,,,,,2021-08-07,

Local and global economic and socio-cultural influence are also driving city redevelopment. This, fundamentally political, development highlights issues of who pays and who gains, who decides and how, and who/what is to be valued. Climate change adaptation has primarily been informed by science, but the adaptation discourse has widened to include the social sciences, subjecting adaptation practices to political analysis and critique. In this article, we critically discuss the just city concept in a climate adaptation context. We develop the just city concept by describing and discussing key theoretical themes in a politically and justice-oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in cities. We illustrate our arguments by looking at recent case studies of climate change adaptation in three very different city contexts: Port Vila, Baltimore City, and Karlstad. We conclude that the social context with its power asymmetries must be given a central position in understanding the distribution of climate risks and vulnerabilities when studying climate change adaptation in cities from a climate justice perspective.","[Granberg, Mikael; Glover, Leigh] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Granberg, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.; Granberg, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.; Granberg, M (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",mikael.granberg@kau.se; leigh.glover@kau.se,"Granberg, Mikael/B-5399-2013","Granberg, Mikael/0000-0002-5356-4112",Swedish Civil Contingency Agency [MSB/2016-6855],"This research was funded by the research fund of the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency, MSB/2016-6855.",,123,3,3,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1201,10.3390/su13031201,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6LB,WOS:000615626000001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

Different socioeconomic and racial groups often face unequal exposure to heat as well as increased heat-related sickness, mortality, and energy costs. We provide new insight into thermal inequities by analyzing 20 Southwestern U.S. metropolitan regions at the census block group scale for three temperature scenarios (average summer heat, extreme summer heat, and average summer nighttime heat). We first compared average temperatures for top and bottom decile block groups according to demographic variables. Then we used spatial regression models to investigate the extent to which exposure to heat (measured by land surface temperature) varies according to income and race. Large thermal inequities exist within all the regions studied. On average, the poorest 10% of neighborhoods in an urban region were 2.2 degrees C (4 degrees F) hotter than the wealthiest 10% on both extreme heat days and average summer days. The difference was as high as 3.3-3.7 degrees C (6-7 degrees F) in California metro areas such as Palm Springs and the Inland Empire. A similar pattern held for Latinx neighborhoods. Temperature disparities at night were much smaller (usually similar to 1 degrees F). Disparities for Black neighborhoods were also lower, perhaps because Black populations are small in most of these cities. California urban regions show stronger thermal disparities than those in other Southwestern states, perhaps because inexpensive water has led to more extensive vegetation in affluent neighborhoods. Our findings provide new details about urban thermal inequities and reinforce the need for programs to reduce the disproportionate heat experienced by disadvantaged communities.","[Dialesandro, John; Brazil, Noli; Wheeler, Stephen] Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Abunnasr, Yaser] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Landscape Design & Ecosyst Management, Bliss St,POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon","Dialesandro, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jdiales@ucdavis.edu; nbrazil@ucdavis.edu; smwheeler@ucdavis.edu; ya20plus@gmail.com,,,,,,43,2,2,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This study applies these three concepts to an urban community at risk of SLR in Botany Bay, Australia. The study engaged diverse groups of residents via an online survey. Cluster analysis identified four interpretive communities: two groups value work-life balance, are concerned about SLR and would likely engage in collective adaptation. The third group value everything about Botany Bay and are active in organisations that could prove to be an important outreach. The fourth group were older men, disengaged from both SLR and policy but could respond to individual consultation and targeted communication. Thus, multifarious approaches can engage diverse communities in fair decision-making and transform community-facilitated adaptation.","[Kreller, Ann Maree] Univ New South Wales UNSW, Arts & Social Sci, UNSW Sydney, Morven Brown Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Kreller, AM (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales UNSW, Arts & Social Sci, UNSW Sydney, Morven Brown Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.kreller@student.unsw.edu.au,,,,,,87,2,2,4,4,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

In this study, we show how this inequality is intersectional; identities like gender and age compound and interact with systems of power to shape how people adapt to these changes at the individual, household, and district scales. We draw from 130 semi-structured interviews with agricultural actors and participant observations in district and regional meetings across four districts, to demonstrate how intersectionality shapes adaptation to social-ecological change. Our results show (1) what social-ecological changes are perceived and experienced, (2) how individuals, households, and groups within the agricultural sector adapt to these changes in private (at the individual and household scale) and public adaptation spaces (institutions where people adapt collectively within each district), and (3) how intersectionality shapes adaptive capacity to these changes. Specifically, we found that 'unskilled' women diversified their income through day-labor in agriculture, while 'unskilled' men had more options for income diversification. Migrants who are also renters had access to water; however, migrants who lived in informal settlements lacked water access. Pastoralists over 50 faced more difficulties pursuing income diversification and labor migration than younger populations with similar livelihoods. Public adaptation spaces, including irrigation commissions, were largely designed for Spanish-speaking men who own land, which caused additional barriers for Quechua speakers, women, and migrants who used this space to contribute to adaptation for themselves, their household, and for the broader district. Together, these results expand scholarship on differential adaptation to social-ecological change within globally marginalized, yet locally heterogenous, communities. In particular, this study brings to light how intersecting identities, along with the social, political and economic structures in which they are situated, can lead to unequal adaptation opportunities within heterogeneous communities.

Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions-approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making.","[Cousins, Joshua J.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Cousins, JJ (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",jcousins@esf.edu,,,,,,145,4,4,38,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper aims to consider the question of how universities should respond and what role they might best adopt in current circumstances. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a conceptual framework, the paradox model, which places sustainability within the contradictory, messy and uncertain terrain that characterises higher education (HE). This is derived from the own experience of leading sustainability within one UK university, as well as the continued engagement with educational theory and philosophy. Findings This paper identifies two fundamental contradictions or paradoxes facing those seeking to engage in sustainability in HE, namely, how to develop authentic sustainability responses within the context of existing HE structures and processes and how to reconcile the demand for immediate action with the much more gradual processes of education. This paper represents these two paradoxes as intersecting axes on a diagram, which creates four quadrants in which a diverse range of responses can be located. The point where these two axes intersect is particularly significant and provides a place from which to navigate responses both individually, collectively and institutionally. Originality/value This paper argues that wisdom provides a guiding principle for discerning which type of response might be appropriate in any given context. It may also indicate a route towards institutional change and underpin the vision of the ecological university of the future based on principles of civic responsibility and social justice.","[Kemp, Nicola; Scoffham, Stephen] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Dept Sustainabil, Canterbury, Kent, England","Kemp, N (corresponding author), Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Dept Sustainabil, Canterbury, Kent, England.",nicola.kemp@canterbury.ac.uk; s.scoffham848@canterbury.ac.uk,,,,,,43,0,0,11,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

Drawing on empirical evidence from Honduras, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Puerto Rico, and analysis of the global landscape of adaptation finance, this perspective identifies ways that designing policy under conditions of scarcity can inadvertently lead to adaptation policies that reinforce inequality and fail to address underlying social vulnerabilities. It reflects on two sources of scarcity that impact adaptation policy-lack of data and lack of finance-and acknowledges that despite the non-ideal conditions this scarcity creates, adaptation policy will be designed under these conditions. The perspective highlights issues to be aware of when designing adaptation policy and calls for greater attention to the social justice implications in the policy design process.","[Kuhl, Laura] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Kuhl, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",l.kuhl@northeastern.edu,,,,,,118,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-3330,2590-3322,,ONE EARTH,One Earth,FEB 19,2021,4,2,,,,,202,212,,10.1016/j.oneear.2021.01.008,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RW3WZ,WOS:000646457900009,,,,,2021-08-07,

It proposes a tempo-material analysis of carbon resources like coal, oil, and gas to illuminate how fossil materialities both underpin and undermine modern temporalities and introduce the notion of fossil modernity to evoke an understanding of the modern composed of multiple conflicting modes of material temporality. Fossil resources (fossil fuels and petrochemical substances) drive the pace and progressive perspective of modernity. The residuals of these resources (CO2, plastic waste, and petrochemical toxins) confront societies with long-lasting ecological damage. Fossil fuels helped to produce the expectation of growth and endless possibility. Fossil residuals create a horizon of ecological liabilities in which past options have become future obligations. This renders the pretences of modernization understood as a process of constant renewal and innovation problematic. The article argues that modern societies cannot simply overcome their material-temporal predicaments through decarbonization because even after a shift to solar power, organic agriculture, and sustainable plastics, the fossil past will continue to influence, inform, and incite social operations. The article thus shows how different responses to the problems of fossil modernity need to go back to and emerge from the material residues of the past: this goes for bio-capitalist projects seeking to recycle the entropic temporality of fossil residuals as well as for environmental justice movements that decipher these residuals as indexes of social asymmetries and call for socio-ecological redistribution.","[Folkers, Andreas] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Sociol, Giessen, Germany","Folkers, A (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Soziol, Karl Glockner Str 21E, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Andreas.Folkers@sowi.uni-giessen.de,,"Folkers, Andreas/0000-0002-6721-3663",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [433336180],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) grant number: 433336180.",,107,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0961-463X,1461-7463,,TIME SOC,Time Soc.,MAY,2021,30,2,,,,,223,246,0961463X20987965,10.1177/0961463X20987965,,FEB 2021,24,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,RI7CR,WOS:000620008400001,,hybrid,,,2021-08-07,

Due, in part, to the ongoing climate crisis, male members of coastal households in Bangladesh are outmigrating temporarily or permanently. Reduced farm productivity can be blamed on this to a large extent. Men leave female members of their households behind in their coastal villages during the first phase of migration. This creates a new form of social injustice as women are not only exposed to the negative impacts of the climate crisis to a larger extent, but they also face the challenges of maintaining a farming livelihood as they confront patriarchal socio-cultural norms and expectations during the absence of male members of the families. Using the frameworks of critical development and political ecology, this paper unpacks how these farming women who stay in the rural villages in coastal Bangladesh have a higher social vulnerability then men do. More particularly, this paper illustrates the complex nature of social and environmental injustice, experienced by women because of the outmigration of male members of the households. An intersectional approach further explains how, in contrast to usual class / income privileges, religio-cultural norms and prohibitions result in women belonging to the ethno-religious majority being more vulnerable than minority women. This is due to restrictions from interacting alone with men to whom they are not related, which reduces their access to the knowledge and resources that flows though male-dominated social networks. This article contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and the environment, mediated by various social, cultural, and political factors, and provides critical policy insights on inclusive adaptation and long-term sustainability.","[Ahmed, Saleh] Boise State Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Eklund, Elizabeth] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA","Ahmed, S (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",salehahmed@boisestate.edu; felisbieti@email.arizona.edu,,"Ahmed, Saleh/0000-0002-5064-1389",National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA13OAR4310184]; U.S. Agency for International Development under the International Research and Applications Project,This research was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Grant NA13OAR4310184 with contributions from the U.S. Agency for International Development under the International Research and Applications Project.,,24,0,0,15,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-8374,1477-1500,,ASIAN AFF,Asian AFF,JAN 1,2021,52,1,,,,,155,174,,10.1080/03068374.2021.1880213,,FEB 2021,20,Area Studies,Area Studies,QX5DC,WOS:000619721800001,,,,,2021-08-07,

Charting the rise of climate change's urban agenda over the past decade, I suggest we are now witnessing a 'third wave' of climate urbanism in which the challenge of addressing climate change is recognised as deeply connected to wider issues of sustainable development and social justice. These shifts are in turn shaped by and giving rise to new developments in terms of the form of climate politics, how it is conducted, and where the battle lines over what it means to act politically under conditions of climate change are being drawn. Recognising that the nature of climate urbanism is continually emergent and highly contested will be critical for future work in this field.","[Bulkeley, Harriet] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England; [Bulkeley, Harriet] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands","Bulkeley, H (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England.; Bulkeley, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.a.bulkeley@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,66,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

In this paper, we demonstrate how a recently developed inequality measure-the Kolm-Pollak equally-distributed equivalent (EDE)-could be used to support decision making to foster equity in the built environment. The EDE provides a measure of a distribution that is similar to the average (mean) but includes a penalty based on the inequality of that distribution. The primary advantage of the Kolm-Pollak EDE is that it can be used to evaluate the inequality of both desirable quantities (e.g., amenities) and undesirable quantities (e.g., burdens). This is essential in urban systems as inequities can manifest through, among other things, disparate access to opportunities like public amenities and unequal exposure to burdens, such as pollution and natural hazards. Additionally, the Kolm-Pollak EDE can be calculated for different sociodemographic subgroups, enabling needs-based assessments to promote environmental justice. Thus, the Kolm-Pollak EDE presents numerous opportunities for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers concerned with advancing equity. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of grocery store access in ten cities across the USA and provide a Python package (inequalipy) and R code to enable others to use these inequality metrics.","[Logan, T.

Right-wing recalcitrance and hostility to climate change policy have been attributed to the authoritarian personality, rejection of science, skeptical views of government elites and corporations, and even some forms of psychological distress. Employing public opinion data collected in the U.S. during the first term of the Trump Presidency, our work confirms that persons who score high on populism, authoritarianism, anti-science indices, and those who hold ideologically conservative views tend to oppose increased public investment in alternative energy. Not explored in the environmental policy and alternative energy literature is the conflicted (or compassionate) conservative; the individual who espouses conservative values yet supports social justice-promotive public policies. As an addition to current theoretical and empirical understanding, we find that conflicted conservatives, individuals who identify as politically conservative yet favor social justice expenditures, are significantly more supportive of enhanced public investment in alternative energy.","[Simon, Christopher A.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Moltz, Michael C.] Shippensburg Univ, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA","Simon, CA (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",simon@mpa.utah.edu; MCMoltz@ship.edu,,,,,,90,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

This article discusses the opportunities in this context for those who face displacement by the effects of climate change, an issue that is not necessarily at the heart of either climate justice debates or climate displacement debates. Discussions about how to respond to displacement arising in the context of climate change often focus on the 'protection space' or 'assistance space', in which those affected are conceptualized as actual or potential seekers of protection or assistance, who may or may not be owed refuge elsewhere on account of unmet needs for shelter, support or safety. This article takes a different approach and conceptualizes those affected as potential or actual seekers of justice, who may be owed rectification for inflicted harm. The article thus contributes to emerging scholarship concerning climate change litigation and climate harm reversal, by focusing on the corrective justice potential for those who face the specific issue of displacement stemming from climate change. To this end, the article provides the relevant practical and analytical background, and discusses key recent law and policy developments in both the domestic and cross-border spheres. The article considers not merely the nexus between displacement stemming from climate change and considerations of justice, but also how and where justice in this context is or may be sought.","[Thornton, Fanny] Univ Canberra, Canberra Law Sch, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Thornton, F (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Canberra Law Sch, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Fanny.Thornton@canberra.edu.au,,"Thornton, Fanny/0000-0001-9823-8903",,,,78,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2047-1025,2047-1033,,TRANSNATL ENVIRON LA,Transnatl.

Widespread agreement about climate change is found within the scientific community, but general populations, especially in the USA, lag behind in accepting climate change.

These range from access, governance, cost minimisation, through austerity and poverty in affected areas, to realpolitik (e.g. vested interests, nationalism, corruption, security breakdown and war). Ongoing incidents show inequalities in spill risk and OSR capability. Advances in knowledge have belatedly brought us to the conclusion that the logical way to reduce adverse impacts of oil in an era of global warming is to accelerate decarbonisation. This would rapidly and simultaneously reduce the frequency, magnitude and consequences of oil spills. Meanwhile, mitigating spills, managing OSR, and restoring local communities and ecosystems at spill sites are fundamental obligations for the oil industry. These obligations should be routinely enforced by all responsible governments, and backed by inter-governmental agencies and conventions.

Aloha Modified Letter Turned CommaAina structured centuries of sustainability and it has evolved over generations to frame community responses to crucial issues today, such as climate change, oligopolistic markets, and contemporary land management. This paper sits at the intersection of cross-disciplinary collaboration, sustainability, and sustainable development.

As income is a key determinant of ecological impacts, the Global North-and wealthier classes elsewhere-are the primary drivers of global carbon emissions, while the least well off have contributed the least yet are set to be hit hardest by climate impacts. These inequalities are clearly unjust, but the interrelations between economic inequality and ecological impacts are complex, leaving open the question of whether reducing the former would mitigate the latter, in the absence of reductions in total economic output. Here, we contribute to these debates by estimating the carbon-footprint implications of reducing income (and hence expenditure) inequalities within 32 countries of the Global North to the levels people consider to be fair; levels that are substantially smaller than currently exist. We find that realising these levels of economic inequality brings comparable reductions in carbon-footprint inequalities. However, in isolation, implementing fair inequalities has a negligible impact upon total emissions. In contrast, recomposing consumption-by reducing inequalities in household expenditure and the overall levels, then reallocating the reductions to public services-reduces carbon footprint by up to 30% in individual countries and 16% overall and, crucially, still allows the consumption of those at the bottom to rise. Such reductions could be significant on a global level, and they would be additional to the full range of conventional technological and demand-side measures to reduce carbon emissions.","[Millward-Hopkins, Joel; Oswald, Yannick] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Millward-Hopkins, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",joeltmh@gmail.com,,"Millward-Hopkins, Joel/0000-0003-4189-1658",Leverhulm Trust through the Living Well Within Limits project [RL2016-048],The authors acknowledge the support of the Leverhulm Trust through the Living Well Within Limits project (LiLi; RL2016-048) and we thank the reviewers for generously volunteering their time to offer their many valuable comments.,,65,0,0,4,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Expansions in renewable energy and the persistent grasp of fossil fuels over a historically centralised sector surface new challenges of socio-spatial and environmental justice. Where does new energy infrastructure appear, how is this decided, who benefits and who is burdened? What land uses are displaced and with what socio-ecological implications? This collection pulls together insights from environmental and land governance, ethnographic studies of situated social identities, and emerging conceptualisations of energy infrastructure to address these concerns. It features contributions focused at multiple scales - the urban, regional, national and trans-local - and informed by a variety of cognate conceptual lenses: political ecology, human geography, social anthropology, urban studies, socio-technical transitions and epistemic politics. Examining cases from three continents, both the Global South and North, the theme issue presents an array of perspectives from established and emerging scholars. It seeks to combine empirically rich and theoretically rigorous enquiry at the conjuncture of energy infrastructure transitions, changing land use and morphing social identity. The aim is thus to further interdisciplinary knowledge on socio-ecological implications of cross-sectoral transitions.","[Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Kjell Arholms Gate 23, N-4023 Stavanger, Norway","Sareen, S (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Kjell Arholms Gate 23, N-4023 Stavanger, Norway.",siddharth.sareen@uis.no,,,Meltzer Foundation; Norwegian Network for Asian Studies,"The author is grateful to participants at a 2-4 February 2020 manuscript workshop in Voss (Sangeetha Chandrashekeran, Zora Kovacic, Luis Silva, Ankit Kumar, Jessica Verheij, Kenneth Bo Nielsen, Patrik Oskarsson and Soren Becker) of whom the last four also served as panellists for a thematic seminar on 5 February 2020 at the National Sustainable Development Goals Conference in Bergen.

Clearly, we are losing the battle and must change business-as-usual if we are to protect wild primates and their habitats. This article is a call to action. Primate societies and their membership need to expand their engagement in scientific advocacy and scientific activism designed to educate, inspire, organize, and mobilize global citizens to join together, lobby business leaders and politicians in both primate habitat countries and in consumer nations, boycott forest-risk products, participate in demonstrations and letter writing campaigns, and use social media to effect transformational change.

This scoping review demonstrates how fundamental principles of EJ can bolster and compliment those of social vulnerability (SV) with a focus on stormwater systems and flood risks. The discussion and conceptual framework provide in-depth insight to how neighborhoods are not inherently vulnerable, but occupy built environments that are systematically sequestered, neglected, and underserved. Social processes and larger planning and development patterns shaped by power and privilege create areas of both prosperity and disadvantage. These outcomes are brought about specifically by early racial zoning, segregation, legalized redlining, and ultimately the isolation of racial minorities that have led to diminished tax bases and built environments in disrepair. Thus, infrastructural robustness and resilience at the neighborhood level result directly from human decisions and social ideologies of environmental racism and classism. The associated human-built environment manifests social and physical circumstances of damage and disease mentioned in both the SV and EJ literatures. The built environment must be explored with a progressive lens that views physical infrastructure as an extension of social circumstances to gain a comprehensive and robust understanding of how low-income communities and communities of color are unequally managed and protected in both daily environmental conditions and extreme events.","[Hendricks, Marccus D.] Univ Maryland, Urban Studies & Planning Program, Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, 3835 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Van Zandt, Shannon] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Architecture, Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Hendricks, MD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Urban Studies & Planning Program, Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, 3835 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mdh1@umd.edu,,,,,,81,2,2,5,5,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

They were well respected for their ability to unite the world's countries on some issues. The paradigm transformation of UN ratifications to combine both business models and social justice has received both positive and negative responses. While adherents argue that such a transformation is fundamental to boost economic development, opponents assert that the 'so-called paradigm transformation' has benefited the West by victimising the East, which has essentially complicated the global 'sustainability crisis'. This also hinders executing the ESD (education for sustainable development) concept, especially in developing countries. The concept of 'sustainable development' is now the main agenda item of UN conventions. COP21 (United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015, otherwise known as the 21st Conference of the Parties), is an example of the UN's seriousness in addressing the 'global sustainability crisis'. GATT and GATS are the international policies that are, respectively, the 'causer' and 'developer' of the private university sector in emerging market economies. Critics claim that this expanding sector generates an urban sustainability crisis. This study examined the effect of private universities' expansion on urban sustainability, using a qualitative method for assessing primary and secondary data. The indices for night light intensity, heat and greenery served as the essential parameters to calculate the sustainability crisis. Results indicate that while the greenery index has fallen significantly, night light and heat indices have unexpectedly increased, which correlate with the development and expansion of the private university sector. To respond to COP21, a 'carbon neutrality' policy framework for the sector is suggested in an effort to control the sustainability crisis.","[Alam, Gazi Mahabubul; Roslan, Samsilah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Educ Studies, Dept Fdn Educ, Serdang 43300, Malaysia; [Al-Amin, Abul Quasem] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Leal Filho, Walter] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Res & Transfer Ctr Sustainable Dev & Climate Chan, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany","Alam, GM (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Educ Studies, Dept Fdn Educ, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.",samsilah@upm.edu.my; al.amin@caceps.ca; al.amin@caceps.ca; walter.leal2@haw-hamburg.de,"Filho, Walter Leal/AAU-6997-2021; Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/AAH-4073-2019; ALAM, GAZI MAHABUBUL/B-5192-2010","Filho, Walter Leal/0000-0002-1241-5225; Al-Amin, Abul Quasem/0000-0002-6097-1197; ALAM, GAZI MAHABUBUL/0000-0003-2867-6793; Roslan, Samsilah/0000-0003-1795-1606",,,,57,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,8,,,,,,,4520,10.3390/su13084520,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RU7RR,WOS:000645341300001,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2021-08-07,

This study examined the area burned by wildfires over the entire state of California from the years 2000 to 2020 in order to quantify and identify whether burned area and fire frequency differed across Census tracts according to socioeconomic indicators over time. Wildfire data were obtained from the California Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) and National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), while demographic data were obtained from the American Community Survey. Results showed a doubling in the number of Census tracts that experienced major wildfires and a near doubling in the number of people residing in wildfire-impacted Census tracts, mostly due to an over 23,000 acre/year increase in the area burned by wildfires over the last two decades. Census tracts with a higher fire frequency and burned area had lower proportions of minority groups on average. However, when considering Native American populations, a greater proportion resided in highly impacted Census tracts. Such Census tracts also had higher proportions of older residents. In general, high-impact Census tracts tended to have higher proportions of low-income residents and lower proportions of high-income residents, as well as lower median household incomes and home values.

The data are needed to develop targeted action for vulnerable groups. Method To close this gap, a representative survey of the population was carried out in Dresden in 2017. Two urban districts, which differ from one another both in terms of urban planning and social structure, were compared, in particular, regarding the question of whether there was a fair distribution or procedural justice concerning the effects of subjective heat burden and influencing factors. Results The results showed that especially inhabitants of the urban area with predominantly prefabricated buildings, less green space and an increased proportion of socially disadvantaged felt more exposed to the summer heat and had fewer opportunities to adapt to the high temperature. Conclusion In addition to urban development measures, the results can be used to derive measures for the prevention of heat-related illnesses. These require, for example, increased advice and health education locally to reach people.","[Looks, Peggy] Landeshauptstadt Dresden, Gesundheitsamt, Richard Wagner Str 17, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Borchers, Peggy] Tech Univ Dresden, Allgemeinmed, Dresden, Germany; [Reinfried, Franziska] Landeshauptstadt Dresden, Umweltamt, Dresden, Germany; [Oertel, Holger] Landeshauptstadt Dresden, Kommunale Stat Stelle, Dresden, Germany; [Kugler, Joachim] Tech Univ Dresden, Lehrstuhl Gesundheitswissensch Publ Hlth, Med Fak, Dresden, Germany","Looks, P (corresponding author), Landeshauptstadt Dresden, Gesundheitsamt, Richard Wagner Str 17, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",PLooks@dresden.de,,,,,,13,0,0,5,5,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-3790,1439-4421,,GESUNDHEITSWESEN,Gesundheitswesen,APR,2021,83,4,,,,,303,308,,10.1055/a-1138-0355,,,6,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",RJ9NI,WOS:000637926200010,32485751,,,,2021-08-07,

Studies in environmental justice concur that the adverse effects of urban climate change are disproportionately greater for the demographically vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, the children, and the socially marginalized. Yet, little is known about how these social groups contribute to urban climate change policies. Accounting for local climate risks and the presence of national adaptation schemes, this study examines whether the implementation of adaptation policies in the 902 European cities is influenced by the proportion of these vulnerable groups. Our results show a positive and significant association between the proportion of elderly citizens and adaptation policies among these European cities. The result of this study offers local level empirical evidence to the climate justice discussion and suggests that the adaptation policies adopted by these European cities are working to ameliorate environmental injustice faced by the older and weaker social groups.","[Yang, Hyuk] Rutgers Univ Newark, Sch Publ Affairs & Adm, 111 Washington St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Lee, Taedong] Yonsei Univ, Polit Sci Dept, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Lee, T (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Polit Sci Dept, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea.",hy265@scarletmail.rutgers.edu; tdlee@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [2019S1A5A2A01047251],This work was funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (2019S1A5A2A01047251) .,,57,2,2,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

With a substantial body of literature amassed since the term's inception in 2015, there is a need to systematically review existing literature to identify overarching gaps and trends, according to disciplinary focus, geographic scope, and key themes, and direct future research inquiry and policy recommendations. This review consists of bibliometric analysis and thematic analysis for NBS studies in urbanism. NBS studies were found to relate strongly with other concepts of 'Ecosystem Services', 'Green Infrastructure', 'Climate Change', and 'Risk management and Resilience', which align with four major thematic goals set by the European Commission. Within NBS scholarship, various sub-themes have emerged, namely, 'Greening', 'Urban Development', 'Water', 'Wellbeing', and 'Governance'. Furthermore, we illustrate that the amount and thematic focus of NBS research have been unevenly distributed worldwide. Analysis of emerging trends shows a recent increase in topics, such as adaptive governance of NBS, and the incorporation of social justice in sustainability transitions. Based on an assessment of extant NBS literature, we offer some recommendations for the future direction of the research fields.","[Li, Lei; Chan, Faith Ka Shun] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Geog Sci, Ningbo 315000, Peoples R China; [Cheshmehzangi, Ali] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China; [Cheshmehzangi, Ali] Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, A601,1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan; [Chan, Faith Ka Shun] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Chan, Faith Ka Shun] Univ Leeds, Water Leeds Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Ives, Christopher D.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Cheshmehzangi, A (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China.; Cheshmehzangi, A (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, A601,1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan.",zy13104@nottingham.edu.cn; Ali.Cheshmehzangi@nottingham.edu.cn; faith.chan@nottingham.edu.cn; Chris.Ives@nottingham.ac.uk,"Ives, Christopher/I-3278-2013; Chan, Faith Ka Shun/H-1541-2017","Ives, Christopher/0000-0003-0438-7225; Cheshmehzangi, Ali/0000-0003-2657-4865; Li, Lei/0000-0002-8743-9993; Chan, Faith Ka Shun/0000-0001-6091-6596","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71950410760]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41850410497]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFC1510400]; Faculty of Science and Engineering (FoSE), at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), grant number 71950410760, which also funded the APC.

The EU and changing practices of climate justice,POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,EU; Climate change; Climate justice; Ethics; Negotiations; Environment; European Union,,"Climate change constitutes one of the most pressing political problems of our time and has profound implications for global justice. However, despite the recent progress of the international negotiations embodied in the Paris Agreement, most scientists and activists agree that the adopted measures are not adequate or ?just? considering the magnitude of the problem. Thus, there is a pressing need for political forerunners that could push the regime towards a more just handling of the problem. The European Union for most of the time has presented itself as a strong advocate for progressive climate action and has been called a climate vanguard or ?green normative power?. This paper critically assesses the EU?s role concerning climate change from a perspective of global political justice, which builds on a tripartite theoretical conception, consisting of ?non-domination?, ?impartiality? and ?mutual recognition?. It inquires to which conceptions of justice the EU?s climate strategy and approach to the international negotiations have corresponded, how and why changes have come about, and whether the EU was able to influence the international regime. The paper finds that while the EU started out from a focus on political measures linked to impartiality, after the failed negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009 it has become more open towards policies and instruments in line with mutual recognition and non-domination. Thus, the emphasis moved away from top-down, legally binding measures, towards voluntary bottom-up procedures, a recognition of difference and diplomatic outreach activities. While this shift was necessary to reinstate the EU?s influence and secure the Paris Agreement, it could hamper the quest for robust climate abatement measures and global climate justice.","[von Lucke, Franziskus] Univ Tubingen, Melanchthonstr 36,Room 104, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany","von Lucke, F (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Melanchthonstr 36,Room 104, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",franziskus.von-lucke@uni-tuebingen.de,,,European UnionEuropean Commission [693609],"Research for this article has been funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Program, grant number: 693609.

This in turn lends legibility to Benjamin's century-old political writings, which show how a mythic concept of Schuld continues to inform modern institutions and practices. The essay begins by taking up Dipesh Chakrabarty's exemplary analysis of the Anthropocene to indicate how contemporary debates around climate change and climate justice remain captivated by a mythic way of thinking, which may itself be at the root of these troubles. The contested question of capitalism and the Anthropocene might also be clarified when, following Benjamin, emphasis is placed not on (fossil) capital but on Schuld. Climate justice would, to pursue Benjamin's approach further, suspend the nexus of Schuld. As suggested at the end of the essay, this may prove not to be the achievement of a deliberate or even human action, according to the prevailing understanding of politics, but rather take the form of a climate strike.","[Robinson, Benjamin Lewis] Univ Vienna, Dept German, Vienna, Austria; [Robinson, Benjamin Lewis] Univ Wien, Inst Germanist, Univ Ring 1, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Robinson, BL (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept German, Vienna, Austria.",benjamin.robinson@univie.ac.at,,,,,,51,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-8890,1930-6962,,GER REV,Ger.

Integrating TEK with scientific knowledge has become particularly important in sectors such as agriculture, which both contributes to and is affected by climate change. While there is a general recognition that integrating TEK will contribute to climate change adaptation, agricultural interventions have made little progress in achieving this due to the assumption of a clear divide between TEK and scientific knowledge. This paper considers that knowledge integration is already occurring, but in contexts of economic, sociocultural, and political inequalities. We elaborate on the case of traditional weather forecasting methods used by Mayan indigenous farmers in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to propose a social justice perspective for knowledge integration in climate change interventions. Using information from three studies conducted between 2016 and 2019, we first explain the importance of weather and traditional weather forecast methods for indigenous Mayan farmers. Later we describe in detail both these methods and their links with Mayan cosmology. Findings show how weather phenomena such as drought and hurricanes are main concerns for milpa farming. They illustrate the diversity of traditional short, medium, and long-term weather forecast methods based on observations from nature and the sky. Farmers also perform rituals that are related to their Mayan gods and goddess. As TEK not only defines agricultural calendars but also reproduces Mayan culture, we discuss what is needed for its integration into actions combating climate change. We use a rights-based approach that considers the economic, cultural, and political scales of justice to equally allocate resources and benefits for traditional knowledge systems, recognize indigenous values and worldviews avoiding cultural harms, and accomplish indigenous self-determination through equal representation. As a result, we hope to incentivize development actors engaged in agricultural interventions on climate change to critically reflect and examine power dynamics and relations when working with indigenous communities.","[Camacho-Villa, Tania Carolina; Ramirez-Lopez, Alejandro; Hoil-Tzuc, Matias] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico; [Martinez-Cruz, Tania Eulalia] Univ Greenwich, Livelihoods & Inst Dept, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Teran-Contreras, Silvia] Secretaria Cultura & Las Artes, Patrimonio Cultural, Merida, Mexico; [Camacho-Villa, Tania Carolina] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Inst Agrifood Technol, Lincoln, England","Camacho-Villa, TC (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico.; Camacho-Villa, TC (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Inst Agrifood Technol, Lincoln, England.",CCamachoVilla@lincoln.ac.uk,,,"Fundacion Haciendas del Mundo Maya, A.

This article performs a discourse analysis of climate policy documents from three Swedish government agencies: the Transport Administration, the Energy Agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency. This in order to explore how the different agencies represent social difference: what is made visible; what is obscured; what are the implications? We collected a purposive, collated sample of literature through online searches and personal communications with agency staff. We apply an intersectional approach to the sampled literature. The article finds that while each agency articulates an awareness of social difference, this tends to manifest in broad terms. It argues that this has the effect of obscuring differential climate impacts and effects of climate action, with potential environmental justice implications.

Anxious assemblages may disrupt the reduction of protest to acts of individual expression while promoting intra-movement solidarity. Drawing together literatures about assemblages and anxiety, I show how circulating signs and images on social media can propel protests that repeat and modulate pre-existing expressions of anxiety. I then use visual and textual methods to demonstrate how Flood Wall Street emerged from a Twitter campaign to transform protestors into a flood or bodies that predicted global climate chaos and spurred participants' ongoing agitation against the causes of climate change. This essay provides an important analytical tool for analyzing the repetitive and collective tactics now popular among climate justice organizations, explaining how they promote intragroup solidarity and elicit further agitation.","[Greenwalt, Dustin] Penn State Univ, Dept Commun Arts & Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Greenwalt, D (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Commun Arts & Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",Dag30@psu.edu,,,,,,71,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

There is, however, a knowledge gap in how to design and plan nature-based solutions in a nonanthropocentric manner that enhances co-benefits for humans and nonhuman living organisms. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how an ecological justice perspective can advance the understanding of nature-based solutions. We argue that ecological justice, which builds on the equitable distribution of environmental goods and bads, social-ecological interconnectedness, nature's agency and capabilities, and participation and inclusion in decision-making, provides a transformative framework for rethinking nature-based solutions in and for cities. A qualitative analysis of 121 peer-reviewed records shows a highly human-centred worldview for delivering nature-based solutions and a relationship to social justice with no direct reference to the dimensions of ecological justice. There is, however, an underlying recognition of the importance of nonhumans, ecosystem integrity and well-being, and a need to consider their needs and capacities through multispecies nature-based solutions design and planning. We conclude with a discussion of the critical aspects for designing and planning ecologically just cities through nature-based solutions and future research directions to further integrate these fields.","[Pineda-Pinto, Melissa; Frantzeskaki, Niki; Nygaard, Christian A.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Hlth Arts & Design, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Pineda-Pinto, M (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Hlth Arts & Design, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",mpinedapinto@swin.edu.au; nfrantzeskaki@swin.edu.au; anygaard@swin.edu.au,,"PINEDA PINTO, MELISSA/0000-0001-9644-0569",,,,133,0,0,16,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,1654-7209,,AMBIO,Ambio,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s13280-021-01553-7,,APR 2021,16,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RO0CK,WOS:000640718700001,33864236,,,,2021-08-07,

This analysis offers a unique example of place-based protest that is focused on otherwise ignored BLM lands. Moreover, we focus on a place-Salt Lake City-that is not conventionally perceived as a bastion of activism and protest about climate change.

This paper encourages the development and improvement of such courses but recognizes that ESS faculty will have to select topics and resources to match their own abilities and interests and the needs of their students. The paper (a) proposes a framework for conceptual content and (b) suggests numerous resources organized in 5 categories and 17 subcategories. Each subcategory has an explanation of its role in the larger picture about energy, and each resource has a brief annotation about its content and utility.

These theories do not account for health inequities such as those resulting from environmental injustice, in which minority and lower income residents are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards or have less access to environmental goods. Neighborhoods with histories of environmental injustice are also at risk for gentrification as they undergo environmental improvements and new greening projects. We aimed to understand how environmental injustice, urban renewal and green gentrification could inform the understanding of epidemiologic risk transitions. We examined 7 case neighborhoods in cities in the United States and Western Europe which were representative in terms of city region and type, which 1) had experienced a history of environmental injustice and 2) exhibited evidence of recent processes of urban renewal and/or gentrification. In each city, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 172) with city representatives, activists, nonprofits, developers and residents. Respondents reported health implications of traditional (heavy pollutants, poor social conditions), transitional (decontamination, new amenities), new (gentrification, access to amenities), and emerging (displacement, climate-related risks, re-emergence of traditional exposures) exposures. Respondents reported renewed, complexified and overlapping exposures leading to poor mental and physical health and to new patterns of health inequity. Our findings point to the need for theories of environmental and epidemiologic risk transitions to incorporate analysis of trends 1) on a city-scale, acknowledging that segregation and patterns of environmental injustice have created unequal conditions within cities and 2) over a shorter and more recent time period, taking into account worsening patterns of social inequity in cities.","[Cole, Helen V.

Political theories and concepts have been applied as one of these assessment tools, giving rise to a political critique of maladaptation. Such a critique contrasts with the more conventional scientific and technical assessments of adaptation policies, programs and practices. Key political themes in studies of maladaptation include resource management and allocations, decision making processes, equity and fairness, gender, power and influence, and Nature and ecology. Within the scholarship on the politics of maladaptation, overlapping frameworks can be identified. Critiques of adaptation have been applied to the preconditions of adaptation, adaptation decision making processes and institutions, and to adaptation outcomes. There are a number of conceptual challenges in undertaking political analyses of adaptation. In this article, we outline the origins of the adaptation and maladaptation concepts, we describe the key political issues, we identify the application of politics in the maladaptation discourse and identify the major political perspectives. Finally, we draw conclusions on the state of the maladaptation discourse.","[Glover, Leigh; Granberg, Mikael] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Soc Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Granberg, Mikael] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Granberg, M (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Ctr Soc Risk Res & Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.; Granberg, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.; Granberg, M (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",leighfglover@gmail.com; mikael.granberg@kau.se,"Granberg, Mikael/B-5399-2013","Granberg, Mikael/0000-0002-5356-4112",research fund of the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency [MSB/2016-6855],"This research was funded by the research fund of the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency, MSB/2016-6855.",,120,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAY,2021,9,5,,,,,,,69,10.3390/cli9050069,,,19,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SG8TJ,WOS:000653713500001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

With its Anglophone roots in the Cold War, species suicide discourse unites concerns about nuclear arsenals, so-called overpopulation, and environmental injustice across disciplines. Species suicide discourse is indebted to the US-based field of suicide prevention, which for more than half a century has analyzed suicide notes in search of effective prevention methods. Therefore, to theorize suicide prevention in relation to anthropogenic climate change, this article imagines a version of this genre that mediates between individual and collective subjects-called a species suicide note. As an example, the interdisciplinary and multimedia art project Dear Climate (2012-ongoing) by Una Chaudhuri, Oliver Kellhammer, and Marina Zurkow rewrites familiar narratives of crisis, shifting species suicide notes toward irony and unconventional techniques of hope. In analyzing these performative species suicide notes, the author complicates species suicide prevention by foregrounding narratives of irony. These notes accentuate a self-reflexive irony that works toward climate justice for vulnerable humans and more-than-human species.","[Cardon, Kristen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Cardon, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2201-1919,,,ENVIRON HUMANITIES,Environ.

However, a strong emphasis on the monetary value of disaster mitigation leaves open the possibility of inequity in distribution of the benefits of buyouts that may exacerbate social justice issues under conditions of increasing disaster damages due to climate change. Using a complete dataset of U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funded buyout properties we describe the demographic makeup of neighborhoods and counties that have participated in FEMA buyout programs since the 1980s and evaluate differential disadvantages in the chances of receiving a buyout and the amount of money received by buyout participants across characteristics associated with social vulnerability. We find that urban counties with greater resources are more likely to receive funds to administer a buyout program, and that within these counties, minority homeowners are less likely to receive federal aid dollars. In addition, we identify a trend of increasing disparity specifically for Black populations. Our findings suggest that intended objectivity in how voluntary buyout dollars are distributed has led to unintentional inequities at multiple scales that may become more pronounced without changes to existing policy and highlight the growing need for social equity consideration in strategic retreat planning.","[Nelson, K.

This study considers how urban social inequities are distributed in terms of burdens and benefits by quantifying exposure through an urban heat risk index (UHRI), and proximity to greenspace through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), at the ward level in Delhi. Landsat derived remote sensing imagery for May and September 2011 is used in a sensitivity analysis of varying seasonal exposure. Multivariable models based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs) reveal significant statistical associations (p < 0.05) between UHRI/NDVI and several indicators of social vulnerability. For example, the proportions of children (beta = 0.922, p = 0.024) and agricultural workers (beta = 0.394, p = 0.016) are positively associated with the May UHRI, while the proportions of households with assets (beta = -1.978, p = 0.017) and households with electricity (beta = -0.605, p = 0.010) are negatively associated with the May UHRI. In contrast, the proportions of children (beta = 0.001, p = 0.633) and agricultural workers (beta = 0.002, p = 0.356) are not significantly associated with the May NDVI, while the proportions of households with assets (beta = 0.013, p = 0.010) and those with electricity (beta = 0.008, p = 0.006) are positively associated with the May NDVI. Our findings emphasize the need for future research and policies to consider how socially vulnerable groups are inequitably exposed to the impact of climate change-related urban heat without the mitigating effects of greenspace.","[Mitchell, Bruce C.] Natl Community Reinvestment Coalit NCRC, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Chakraborty, Jayajit; Basu, Pratyusha] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Chakraborty, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",bmitchell@ncrc.org; jchakraborty@utep.edu; pbasu@utep.edu,,"Coffyn Mitchell, Bruce/0000-0002-8184-2757",,,,75,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

With an eye for theoretical synthesis, this study asks: What do three particular epistemic communities-those concerning innovation, practices, and justice-say about energy transitions? What does this literature reveal about the injustices and inequalities of energy transitions? Finally, what can we learn by integrating aspects of this literature? The study answers these questions by drawing from responsible research and innovation, social practice theory, and energy justice approaches. Essentially the first is about the design of technology, the second how it is used, the third the broader societal and global implications. Taken together, the study offers an integrative framework capable of analyzing transitions from their cradle of design to their life of use to their grave of aftereffects. It explores the extent to which the three perspectives can be integrated into a meta-theoretical framework. This integrative framework is then applied to four diverse case studies: French nuclear power, Greek wind energy, Papua New Guinean solar energy, and Estonian oil shale.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Cantoni, Roberto] Univ Sussex Business Sch, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Falmer, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Hess, David J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sociol Dept, Nashville, TN USA","Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,,"Cantoni, Roberto/0000-0002-2526-2336",European UnionEuropean Commission [884539],"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 884539 Carbon Intensive Regions in Transition -Unravelling the Challenges of Structural Change (CINTRAN).

This research examines the human dimensions of drought through narratives of drought vulnerability in the agricultural communities of California's San Joaquin Valley during the 2012-2016 drought. Four narratives are identified that reveal the lived experiences and local knowledges of drought as well as the multiple understandings of the political, economic, social, and environmental processes that produce drought vulnerability. The narratives explain the production of drought across long timescales that include both memories of historical events as well as visions of desired futures for the region. Who is vulnerable and why differs across the narratives, with each narrative offering competing understandings for how the relationships between water, agriculture, labor, and rural communities create drought vulnerability. Which narrative becomes dominant and embedded in water governance has impacts on the practice of agriculture as well as social and environmental justice for farmworkers and rural community members.","[Greene, Christina] Univ Arizona, Climate Assessment Southwest, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Greene, C (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Climate Assessment Southwest, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",cgreene@email.arizona.edu,,,Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS); Social & Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at the University of Arizona; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2017-67011-26037],"Initial research was supported by Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) and Social & Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at the University of Arizona.

In this paper, we develop a new approach for examining lived connections between fossil fuel extraction and climate change. We propose the concept of carbon mobilization to describe the multiple stages of fossil fuel extraction and combustion that may be experienced independently (as an economic boom, climate disaster, or air pollution, for example) or simultaneously, in locally distinctive combinations - but until now have been considered separately in most scholarship and public policy. We explore lived experiences of carbon mobilization in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, a community that, in the last decade, has gone through a shale gas boom and bust and has suffered from severe flooding. Interviews with social service providers and county leaders indicated that connections between the fossil fuel industry and climate disaster manifested most saliently around housing security-particularly the loss of housing due to floods and economic insecurity related to boom-bust cycles. Economic changes that gas development brought to the community made flood resilience more challenging for some, and easier for others. Perhaps surprisingly, the natural gas industry was a double winner, benefitting from climate disaster by gaining a reputation for helping with flood recovery. We suggest that while global climate discourse may not resonate locally in communities that host fossil fuel extraction, people make locally-salient connections between different stages of carbon mobilization, and these connections have important public policy and social justice implications.","[Lehman, Jessica] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Kinchy, Abby] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, 5406 Sage Lab Bldg,110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA","Lehman, J (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",jessica.lehman@durham.ac.uk; kincha@rpi.edu,,,"Institute for Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University","The authors would like to thank the Institute for Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University for supporting this research with a small grant.

Assessing the response of hydrological processes and agricultural production to the combined impacts is of great importance for enhancing water resources management, water productivity and agriculture sustainability. SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) models embedded with 2007 and 2018 land use were built for the San Joaquin watershed (SJWS) in California?s Central Valley. Global sensitivity analysis were conducted to select parameters that have the largest influence on evapotranspiration (ET) processes. The model was calibrated and validated produced good agreement for monthly ET from remote sensing and yield of 8 major crops using county level reported yields during the periods of 2001?2009 and 2010?2018. Based on the outputs of the calibrated SJWS SWAT model, regional ET showed a significant increase, which was caused by rises in temperature and changing cropping patterns associated with increase in area under nut crop production. Seven major crop yields increased excluding alfalfa, implying that the impacts of increasing temperature and small decreases in precipitation were not dominant factors in explaining observed changes in yield. From periods 2001?2009?2010?2018, total water productivity (WP) increased slightly from 2.11 to 2.15 kg/m3, associated with more water-intensive permanent crop production systems. Total economic water productivity (EWP) increased significantly by 111% from 0.55 to 1.16 US$/m3, which also indicated the substantial economic benefit brought to the SJWS by expanding the land area under high-EWP crops such as nut crops and vegetables. Nutritional water productivity (NWP) for energy, protein and fat were reduced from 1211 kcal/m3, 183 g/m3 and 105 g/m3 to 1141 kcal/m3, 111 g/m3 and 88 g/m3 during the period 2010?2018 mostly due to high water use. Total NWP for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg/m3, respectively. This study provides initial insights into the response of WP, EWP and NWP to the changing cropping patterns and climate variability for major crops in the SJWS, which could be used by a wide range of stakeholders including farmers, commodity boards, irrigation districts, groundwater sustainability basins, environmental justice groups and policy makers to optimize water resources planning and management. We recommend creating a comprehensive index that incorporates WP, EWP and NWP for making sustainable water resources planning and management decisions.","[Xue, Jingyuan; Kisekka, Isaya] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Xue, Jingyuan; Kisekka, Isaya] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Xue, Jingyuan; Huo, Zailin] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Kisekka, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ikisekka@ucdavis.edu,,"Kisekka, Isaya/0000-0002-2460-7777",USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant Program from Almond Board of California [180001083SC]; Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research [430871],"This study was supported by the USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant Program from Almond Board of California [grant number 180001083SC], and Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research [grant number 430871].

Building on provocations of Pulido's (2002) paper Reflections on a White Discipline, this article seeks to ensure that racial justice is part of that imagining. There is much to be ecologically gained by moving toward smaller regional gatherings and large virtual conferences. Our task, however, is to assess the loss of mentorship, affirmation, and community found at the AAG Annual Meeting that sustains Black, Indigenous, and people of color geographers in the current climate of our discipline. We deploy the term climate for two reasons. First, climate refers to toxic environments of home institutions within which geographers of color often teach, research, and write (Mahtani 2014). We call on all geographers to contend with the epistemological, institutional, and individual actions needed to detoxify spaces and places of geography. Second, in pace with Pulido (2002), we argue that knowledge production on the climate crisis is enhanced when geography becomes a safer place for geographers of color. Action taken toward climate justice cannot happen without actions to achieve racial justice.","[Bruno, Tianna; Faiver-Serna, Cristina] Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Bruno, T (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",tbruno@uoregon.edu; cfaiver@uoregon.edu,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0033-0124,1467-9272,,PROF GEOGR,Prof. Geogr.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/00330124.2021.1915822,,MAY 2021,6,Geography,Geography,TF2EV,WOS:000670526000001,,,,,2021-08-07,

To make this case, we re-interpret the myth of Cassandra to imagine her as a different kind of person, and explore the ideas and stories of certain Teme Augama Anishinaabe Elders that we believe reflect a divergent ontos (being state) from that of the global, modern West. This being state is embedded in the natural world in a constantly reciprocal and dialogical way. We couple this with parallel arguments from recent theories around the human neuro-hemispheric divide relating to ontology and use both to explore how we might become the kinds of people that are capable of dealing with climate change: Cassandras of the second kind. Viewed methodologically, this paper is a cyclical philosophical investigation that, in part, makes use of hermeneutics and narrative inquiry to understand mythic Greek tales and the stories of Indigenous Elders. It also draws on literary traditions that employ allegory to explore meaning.","[Beeman, Chris] Brandon Univ, Fac Educ, Brandon, MB, Canada; [Blenkinsop, Sean] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Blenkinsop, S (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",sblenkin@sfu.ca,,,,,,26,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0095-8964,1940-1892,,J ENVIRON EDUC,J.

Within this wide array of measures, managed retreat of communities at risk is usually only taken into account if other strategies are ineffective or unavailable. Communities who are affected by managed retreat are confronted with radical changes in their livelihood. However, managed retreat is highly contested. The use of managed retreat includes not only the relocation of house owners but also has the challenge that it discriminates between landowners as some gain and others lose. Therefore, managed retreat raises issues of social justice. To mitigate the impact on land, compensation plays a crucial role in flood risk management. The level and kind of compensation varies between countries across the globe. In this paper, we compare two different policy compensation frameworks in two European countries: Austria and England. The comparative study shows how different compensation schemes affect social justice, both in terms of substantive distributions but also in terms of procedural justice.","[Thaler, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria","Thaler, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria.",thomas.thaler@boku.ac.at,"Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014","Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722",University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU) - Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [B769942],Open access funding provided by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU).

Young climate activists in Finland on fairness and moderation,JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Climate crisis; youth; activism; climate justice; sustainability,,"The youth climate movement is known for its demands that political leaders listen to the views of scientists. Behind this argumentation, however, are multiple values, ideals, and statements for how societies should change in order to become more just and avoid the worst of the climate crisis. This article analyses how young climate activists in Finland understand climate justice, how they regard the current society as socio-ecologically unjust, and how, in their views, these injustices should be addressed. The analysis is based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews (n = 18) conducted during 2020. A theory of justice by John Rawls is applied as a theoretical framework. The results reveal that the status quo is regarded as unjust by climate activists in various dimensions: individual, socio-economic, intergenerational, global, and ecological. However, it was also found that a shared interpretation of climate justice is hard to reach, resulting in a pluralism of views on how the climate crisis should be tackled in a socio-ecologically sound manner. Common ground is found in moderation, which interconnects values and practices and points toward a 'fairer' society. Moderation and 'slowing down' are a point of departure for societal change.","[Piispa, Mikko; Kiilakoski, Tomi] Finnish Youth Res Network, Helsinki, Finland; [Piispa, Mikko] Univ Helsinki, Doctoral Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland","Piispa, M (corresponding author), Finnish Youth Res Network, Helsinki, Finland.; Piispa, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Doctoral Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",mikko.piispa@nuorisotutkimus.fi,,,Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra,This work was supported by Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra.,,30,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-6261,1469-9680,,J YOUTH STUD,J.

It focuses on recent study that attempts to measure disproportionate effects during the implementation of a policy, rather than looking solely at the effects after the policy has been fully implemented. Much of the evaluative literature on environmental policy tends to focus on effects and impacts after policy implementation. But if we are to fully consider the importance of equity as we think about large-scale policy interventions for issues such as climate change, which carry embedded disproportionate impacts, then we likely need to more fully measure policy impacts at all phases: planning, design, implementation, and evaluation. One way of doing this is by examining disproportionality impacts of discrete environmental policies at a smaller scale. What follows is an overview of recent research into sulfur distributions during the implementation of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (sulfur cap-and-trade program), and linking that work to issues of equity and resilience for climate change policy development.","[McGuire, Chad J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA","McGuire, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",cmcguire@umassd.edu,,"McGuire, Chad/0000-0003-2480-4751",,,,20,0,0,3,3,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

This paper applies a social justice framework to examine planning for sea level rise in a densely populated coastal settlement in eastern Australia. The Lake Macquarie area is highly vulnerable to sea level rise with local adaptation planning already underway. An in-depth case study is presented that draws upon 19 interviews with key informants and householders and a structured document and media analysis from 12 newspapers. This qualitative data was analysed to identify: the range of understandings of what is just in planning for sea level rise; and key factors that influence perceptions of justice in planned retreat scenarios. The study concludes that there is a need for guiding principles in decision-making that explicitly address social justice in order to realise more equitable outcomes.","[Frost, Lana; Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Discipline Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Miller, F (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Social Sci, Fac Arts, Level 4,Bldg B,25 Wallys Walk, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",fiona.miller@mq.edu.au,,"Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",Macquarie University Master of Research Scholarship,Lana would like to gratefully acknowledge the funding provided by the Macquarie University Master of Research Scholarship.

However, equity implications are rarely considered explicitly in restoration projects. Although the role of equity has been studied in the context of biodiversity conservation and environmental governance, environmental variables are often ignored in equity studies, and spatial analyses of equity are lacking. To address these gaps, we use a mixed methods approach, integrating spatially explicit ecological and social data to evaluate, through an equity lens, a restoration project in a semi-arid rangeland socioecological system in Kenya. We use questionnaires and semi-structured key informant interviews to explore four dimensions of equity: distributional, procedural, recognitional, and contextual. Our results show that restoration employment and distance to the restoration site strongly influence perceived distributional and procedural equity. Employment and distance to restoration site can interact in counterintuitive ways in their influence on aspects of perceived equity, in this case, the fairness of site selection. Our findings exemplify that equity dimensions are intimately linked, and trade-offs can occur between equity dimensions, across socio-temporal scales, and in choosing the ethical framework to apply. Our work demonstrates how restoration is influenced by different dimensions of equity and we opine that incorporating equity in project planning and implementation processes can improve restoration outcomes. We emphasize the importance of respecting plurality in the values systems and ethical frameworks that underlie what is considered equitable, while negotiating trade-offs between diverse ethical positions in the design and implementation of ecosystem restoration projects.","[Wells, Harry B.

It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives. This article seeks to contribute to the emerging policies of preserving intangible heritage in the context of climate displacement.","[Akturk, Gul] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Lerski, Martha] Lehman Coll, Leonard Lief Lib, New York, NY USA","Akturk, G (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",g.akturk@tudelft.nl; martha.lerski@lehman.cuny.edu,"Akturk, Gul/AAV-8037-2020; Lerski, Martha B/Y-7566-2018","Akturk, Gul/0000-0003-1555-8202; Lerski, Martha B/0000-0002-7436-3969",,,,75,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

As citizens of modern countries, our lives are constrained by different discourses.

One tactic of climate adaptation is strategic retreat, sometimes referred to as managed retreat. Strategic retreat is the process by which the government or another entity purchases (buys out) developed properties that are at risk of destruction or have been destroyed by natural disasters. The structure is most often demolished, and the land is placed under a permanent easement to prevent future development. What happens next is dependent on the entities involved in the buyouts, and can range from derelict, vacant lots to full restoration of ecosystems and their abilities to mitigate flood damage. Sometimes recreational amenities, such as trails or park infrastructure, are prioritized and funded as well. Conservation organizations can leverage their expertise in conservation planning, land acquisition and restoration, policy advocacy, and partnership development to improve the implementation of strategic retreat so that nature and people can thrive in the long term. In this policy paper, we review ways that conservation organizations have and can continue to engage in buyout processes to ensure positive outcomes for communities and nature. Conservation organizations must also evolve their approaches to climate adaptation to integrate equity and redress historical injustices in land use, and contribute towards improving strategic retreat for a more just and resilient future across disaster-prone communities. This work focuses on the context of disasters and climate adaptation in the USA, though many of the principles presented are applicable around the world.","[Kodis, Mali'o] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Bortman, Marci] Nature Conservancy, New York, NY USA; [Newkirk, Sarah] Nat Conservancy Calif, Santa Cruz, CA USA","Kodis, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",maliokodis@gmail.com,,,"Coastal Science and Policy Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Nature Conservancy","Mali'o Kodis' time was supported by a fellowship from the Coastal Science and Policy Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as well as a grant from The Nature Conservancy.",,45,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The USA's first federally funded, community-scale, climate-driven resettlement is currently underway in coastal Louisiana. In January 2016, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded the state of Louisiana $48.3 million to plan, design, and implement a structured, just, and scalable resettlement with former and current Isle de Jean Charles residents. Most Island households are multi-generational and directly descended from Jean Marie Naquin, after whose father the Island is named. Using interviews, ethnographic data, and policy documents, this paper will delineate and analyze the dimensions of sense of place, which, in this case, prompted policy changes dramatically different from standard relocation policies: assurance that the properties and land from which residents are departing will remain in their possession as long as the land remains. For most Island residents, this was non-negotiable. The intangible connection to place-feelings of belonging, lifestyle, family connections, and culture-plays a central role in many families' decision to stay or go. The choice to relocate is rooted in this complex entanglement of identity, familial ties, land loss, historical and current marginalization, and a way of life passed on by multiple generations. In forthcoming community resettlements, continued access and ownership of the properties being left behind should be considered as a critical component for planning just retreats.","[Simms, Jessica R.

These climate organizations work across many boundaries in science, politics, and culture. This article asks how large-scale U.S. climate boundary organizations that convene Indigenous and non-Indigenous climate practitioners contend with ongoing colonialism. Analysis indicates that Indigenous-settler networks offer avenues for Indigenous values to be practiced in collaborative climate science. Such organizations also provide limited opportunities to utilize climate science in tribal climate adaptation. While these boundary organizations aim to build meaningful cross-cultural and mentoring relationships, uneven power dynamics and resources also permeate the partnerships. These structural inequalities cause tensions to arise. Tensions further arise from uses of new terminology to navigate longstanding struggles over places, political sovereignties, and human relationships to natural worlds. I argue that a decolonial environmental framework discerns roles for Indigenous governance in attending to anthropogenic climate change. The approach broadens sociological understandings of climate change by examining the attempts of Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors to build climate networks.","[Dhillon, Carla M.] Bryn Mawr Coll, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA","Dhillon, CM (corresponding author), Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Environm Studies, 101 North Merion Ave, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA.",cdhillon@brynmawr.edu,,,University of Michigan Rackham Gradate School; California State University Chancellor's Doctoral Incentive Program,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research received support from the University of Michigan Rackham Gradate School and the California State University Chancellor's Doctoral Incentive Program.",,69,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

The purposeful movement of people and communities away from hazardous places raises numerous social and environmental justice concerns that will become even more pressing as retreat occurs more frequently and at larger scales. This special issue contributes to an emerging body of literature on managed retreat by providing a range of perspectives and approaches to considering justice in managed retreat. The assembled papers represent diverse voices (including perspectives from individuals whose communities are currently relocating or considering relocation), disciplines (including oral histories, legal analyses, and cultural heritage considerations), and lenses through which to consider the justice implications of managed retreat. They describe completed, in-progress, and foiled relocations. They suggest opportunities for improvement through improved evaluations and broader collaborations. While each presents a unique lens, key themes emerge around the need for transparent and equitable policies, self-determination of communities, holistic metrics for assessing individual and community well-being, the importance of culture both as something to be protected and an asset to be leveraged, and the need to address historical and systemic injustices that contribute to vulnerability and exposure to risk.","[Siders, A.

When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

This essay provides an overview of this inequity and identifies how a scientific society can catalyze representational, structural, and interactional diversity to achieve greater inclusion. Needed changes go beyond representational diversity and require an intentional commitment to build capacity through inclusivity and community engagement by supporting anti-racist policies and actions. We want to realize a sense of belonging on the part of scientists in society at large and enable research pursuits through a lens of social justice in service of coastal communities. Minimally, this framework offers an avenue for increased recruitment of individuals from more diverse racial and ethnic identities. More broadly, the mechanisms described here aim to create a culture in scientific societies in which social justice, driven by anti-racist actions, produces systemic change in how members of scientific societies approach, discuss, and address issues of inequity.

Through a combination of document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, we examine patterns of change in the governance of the Colorado River, as the US and Mexico navigate socioeconomic, cultural, and political asymmetries to jointly share water over the past two decades. We ask: What key events and environmental agreements have influenced transboundary water governance in the Colorado River over the past 20 years? We draw on the rich scholarship on transboundary water governance, especially around international river basin organizations, to uncover patterns of engagement and collaboration over time. We focus on the binational scale with an eye to study governance at multiple scales including interactions and impacts at the national and subnational scales. Our findings illustrate how Mexico's role has evolved from a narrow one following a strict interpretation of the 1944 Treaty toward a more creative partnership between the US and Mexico demonstrated in binational negotiations and the creation of joint solutions to emerging challenges around water conservation and ecological restoration. We find transboundary water governance in the basin is influenced by both long-term and short-term contextual changes that can inform strategies key actors employ to bolster institutional resilience and take advantage of opportunities for transformative change. Further, we find that the evolution of the binational relationship is reflected in changes in the negotiation process and structure, which highlights the importance of trust and relationship building, transparency, joint fact-finding, and information sharing to foster collaboration. However, we also find uneven institutionalization of stakeholder participation and transparency in engagement patterns that may ultimately, serve to hinder governance and cooperation in the basin.","[Rivera-Torres, Mariana] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog, Dev & Environm & Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ USA","Rivera-Torres, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mriveratorres@cbi.org,,"Gerlak, Andrea/0000-0002-2198-6679",Walton Family Foundation,The project team is grateful to the Walton Family Foundation for their support of the larger Colorado River Conversations Project and for funding this research.,,89,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

As an alternative to a planning approach based on quantitative and objective data, the authors propose to build strategic planning of riskscapes upon what they call small data, that is, the ensemble of qualitative and embodied data that can be gathered through street science (Corburn [2005]. Street Science: Community Knowledge and Environmental Health Justice. Cambridge: MIT Press.) and toxic autobiographies (Armiero et al. [2019].

In order to discuss the potential role of both small data and toxic autobiographies in the planning field, the authors present the results of an ongoing empirical case study in Gela, a Sicilian town converted into one of the main Italian petrochemical poles in the 1960s by a multinational oil company. The authors analyse Gela's risk landscapes through the perceptions of citizens and their initiatives to tackle environmental injustices. Finally, the authors argue that small data can provide a better understanding of the landscape of risk through four lenses that allow seeing the slow and diffused change brought by industrial risk: memories of injustice, memories of smell, trans-corporeal stories, and relational stories.","[Privitera, Elisa; Gravagno, Filippo] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Catania, Italy; [Armiero, Marco] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Stockholm, Sweden","Privitera, E (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Catania, Italy.",elisa.privitera@unict.it,"Privitera, Elisa/AAT-3246-2021","Privitera, Elisa/0000-0002-0262-3397; Armiero, Marco/0000-0002-6063-9477; GRAVAGNO, Filippo/0000-0001-5232-2261",,,,160,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,JUL 3,2021,26,7,,,,,847,871,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1922999,,MAY 2021,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,TI7UZ,WOS:000651711600001,,,,,2021-08-07,

The philosophies that underpin and shape traditional conservation initiatives have begun to shift toward a people and nature approach, based on a new and deeper understanding of relational values. With this shift, there is increasing concern about the social impacts of conservation anda need to consider not only the environmental aspects of conservation, but also issues of equity and social justice. This is especially important for marine conservation to avoid repeating the exclusionary and unjust protective measures sometimes seen in traditional terrestrial conservation. Additionally, lack of compliance with management schemes, and failure to consider the social dimensions and realities of local communities have hindered the success of conservation initiatives. Therefore, increasing engagement with social science and a better understanding of humanwildlife and human-nature connections are necessary. Community-based conservation approaches and payment for ecosystem service schemes can provide important insights and lessons for such improved participatory management. Furthermore, the use of social science offers a range of methods and approaches that can be used to improve the consideration of those social dimensions. These include different theoretical frameworks for understanding the relationships between people, society, and nature, innovative participatory methods and more flexible, adaptive systemsbased approaches for understanding complex socio-ecological systems. Increasing and mainstreaming the inclusion of the social dimensions of conservation will also depend on overcoming current institutional barriers such as lack of capacity, time, and funding opportunities especially in the context of marine social science.","[Sanborn, Thomas; Jung, Julia] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium","Sanborn, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium.",thms.sanbom@gmail.com,,"Jung, Julia/0000-0003-3388-6525",state of Bremen,Funding for publishing was granted by the state of Bremen.,,107,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

This article explores how young people's political participation in the School Strike for Climate movement in Australia was represented in newspaper coverage over a 17-month period (August 2018-December 2019), with particular attention to the representation of young people's emotions and actions. The analysis works with a corpus of 500 articles published in Australian national, state (New South Wales and Victoria), and a select sample of regional and rural newspapers. The corpus is read with affective-discursive attunement to historical representations of children and young people, the politics of emotion, and contemporary media representational politics surrounding climate justice activism. Four dominant characterisations of the young strikers are analysed: ignorant zealots, anxious pawns, rebellious truants, and extraordinary heroes. Alongside these characterisations, we consider how young people speak back to these characterisations, and draw implications for future research with young climate justice activists.","[Mayes, Eve; Hartup, Michael Everitt] Deakin Univ Geelong, Fac Arts & Educ, Res Educ Impact REDI, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Mayes, E (corresponding author), Deakin Univ Geelong, Fac Arts & Educ, Res Educ Impact REDI, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",eve.mayes@deakin.edu.au,,,Alfred Deakin Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,This work was supported by an Alfred Deakin Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (Deakin DVCR-funded).,,72,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-6261,1469-9680,,J YOUTH STUD,J.

Case studies of individual cities suggest that heat exposure, like other environmental stressors, may be unequally distributed across income groups. There is little evidence, however, as to whether such disparities are pervasive. We combine surface urban heat island (SUHI) data, a proxy for isolating the urban contribution to additional heat exposure in built environments, with census tract-level demographic data to answer these questions for summer days, when heat exposure is likely to be at a maximum. We find that the average person of color lives in a census tract with higher SUHI intensity than non-Hispanic whites in all but 6 of the 175 largest urbanized areas in the continental United States. A similar pattern emerges for people living in households below the poverty line relative to those at more than two times the poverty line. Individual exposure to heat is associated with adverse health and economic outcomes. Here, the authors show that people of color and people living in poverty bear a disproportionate burden of urban heat exposure in almost all major cities in the continental United States.","[Hsu, Angel] Yale NUS Coll, Singapore, Singapore; [Hsu, Angel] Univ N Carolina, Sch Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Hsu, Angel; Chakraborty, Tirthankar] Data Driven EnviroLab, Singapore, Singapore; [Sheriff, Glenn] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Chakraborty, Tirthankar; Manya, Diego] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT USA","Sheriff, G (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",gsheriff@asu.edu,,"Chakraborty, TC/0000-0003-1338-3525",National University of Singapore Early Career Award [NUS_ECRA_FY18_P15]; Samuel Centre for Social Connectedness [AWDR14157],"The authors would like to thank Nicholas Chin of Yale-NUS College for assistance in extracting US census data, and Barkley Dai of Yale College for compiling an early version of the SUHI United States SUHI Explorer tool in Google Earth Engine.

Though illegal logging has continued, frames about Brazil's forest policy and management have changed since that time. While until 2010 the successful implementation of forest policies and the resulting decline in deforestation rates were there for all to see and appreciate, the increase in the deforestation rate since then has become the focus of international criticism. With the help of a structured review of international scientific literature, newspaper articles, and programmes initiated by non-governmental organizations' (NGO) and international organizations' (10), this paper aims to analyse the frames of illegal logging and its governance responses in Brazil since 2012. The review is guided by the framework of diagnostic (What is the problem? Who is to blame?) and prognostic framing (proposed policy and governance solutions). The main findings revealed a master frame of environmental justice that combines injustice toward indigenous people with the victimization of forest and environment at large. Embedded in this master frame, specific frames that follow the institutional logic of the single policy discourses have been identified. Finally, the results show a strong national focus of governance with continued emphasis on command and control instruments.","[Kleinschmit, Daniela; Ferraz Ziegert, Rafaella; Walther, Laura] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany","Kleinschmit, D (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany.",daniela.kleinschmit@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,,,"Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","The article processing charge was funded by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art and the University of Freiburg in the funding programme Open Access Publishing.",,77,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

To examine research advances and critical gaps, a review of the literature on coastal urban ecology was performed. Articles were selected following a structured decision tree and data were classified into study disciplines, approaches, type of analysis, main research objectives, and Pickett's paradigms in-, of-, and for- the city, among other categories. From a total of 237 publications, results show that most of the research comes from the USA, China, and Australia, and has been carried out mostly in large cities with populations between 1 and 5 million people. Focus has been placed on ecological studies, spatial and quantitative analysis and pollution in coastal urban areas. Most of the studies on urban ecology in coastal zones were developed at nearshore terrestrial environments and only 22.36% included the marine ecosystem. Urban ecological studies in coastal areas have mainly been carried out under the paradigm in the city with a focus on the disciplines of biology and ecology. Results suggest a series of disciplinary, geographical, and approach biases which can present a number of risks. Foremost among these is a lack of knowledge on social dimensions which can impact on sustainability. A key risk relates to the fact that lessons and recommendations of research are mainly from developed countries and large cities which might have different institutional, planning and cultural settings compared to developing and mid-income countries. Scientific research on coastal urban areas needs to diversify toward an ecology of and for the cities, in order to support coastal development in a diversity of countries and settings.","[Graells, Giorgia; Marquet, Pablo A.; Pliscoff, Patricio; Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Graells, Giorgia; Gelcich, Stefan] Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Graells, Giorgia; Lagos, Nelson A.; Gelcich, Stefan] Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile; [Nakamura, Nao] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Celis-Diez, Juan L.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Agron, Quillota, Chile; [Lagos, Nelson A.] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Invest & Innovac El Cambio Climat, Santiago, Chile; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago, Chile","Graells, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile.; Graells, G (corresponding author), Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile.; Graells, G (corresponding author), Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile.",gygrael@uc.cl,,,National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) [21171829]; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [ICN2019_015]; Center of Applied Ecology and Sustainability (CAPES) [ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1190109],"This work was supported by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) Scholarship Program, National graduate scholarship [21171829, 2017], ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [Code ICN2019_015], Center of Applied Ecology and Sustainability (CAPES) [ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002], and Fondecyt 1190109.",,207,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation ignited widespread pronouncements of national state of disasters in various countries around the globe including Zimbabwe. Subsequently, like other countries, Zimbabwe followed the precautionary measures outlined by the WHO and pronounced its national lockdown to curtail the transmission of the virus. This paper intends to demonstrate how convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change impacts serves as a double injustice for rural women in Nyanga communities, Zimbabwe. The study was qualitative in nature guided by the descriptive research design. Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).","[Nyahunda, Louis; Chibvura, Shyleen; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew] Univ Limpopo, Dept Res Adm & Dev, Private Bag X1106, ZA-0727 Sovenga, South Africa","Tirivangasi, HM (corresponding author), Univ Limpopo, Dept Res Adm & Dev, Private Bag X1106, ZA-0727 Sovenga, South Africa.",nyahundalouis@gmail.com; schibvura1990@gmail.com; mathewtirivangasi@gmail.com,,"Nyahunda, Louis/0000-0002-9352-4115; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew/0000-0002-1353-6635",,,,74,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2365-1792,,,J HUM RIGHTS SOC WOR,J.

This raises the question of how this imperative would be met within a tertiary music education context. Does the justified insistence on decolonised curricula in the period following the national #FeesMustFall protests of 2015-2016 allow space for inclusion of climate education? Given the links between social justice and environmental justice, there is certainly an argument for a focus on eco-literate education. What, then, would this include at South African tertiary music level? There are several (mostly United States based) course syllabi available online which focus mainly on themes and case studies in the field of ecomusicology. Daniel J. Shevock's work on eco-literate music pedagogy strongly advocates for a place-based approach, but Greg Garrard's critique would indicate otherwise. This article examines eco-critical and eco-literate theories and their application to music and uses the author's own teaching context to outline ideas for integrating a more climate-related educational approach.","[Jorritsma, Marie] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa","Jorritsma, M (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand East Campus, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",marie.jorritsma@wits.ac.za,,"Jorritsma, Marie/0000-0001-5403-2647",University of the Witwatersrand threshold grant,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The completion of this article was funded by a University of the Witwatersrand threshold grant.",,78,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0255-7614,1744-795X,,INT J MUSIC EDUC,Int.

Detailed, systematic, citywide assessments of specific urban green space characteristics that provide a sufficient understanding of resident interactions with green spaces and respective ecosystem service flows are lacking. We chose the city of Leipzig, one of the fastest growing cities in Germany, as a case study to assess the quality of publicly available green spaces by incorporating spatial context as a key dimension in determining their actual quality. We established 33 indicators that describe (1) natural elements, e.g., the types and configuration of vegetation and the proportion of water bodies; (2) built elements, e.g., various recreational facilities and path density; and (3) the embeddedness of green spaces within the built, social, and natural environment (context), e.g., the number of neighboring residents, nearby green or blue elements, and exposure to traffic. Based on these indicators, we developed a scoring approach that provides an evaluation of green space quality in terms of the potential to provide recreational ecosystem services. We identified and discussed spatial gaps and deficits in the quality of green space supply as well as leverage points for making operational improvements at the individual green space level. Our study provides urban planning guidance for identifying untapped potential for ecosystem services provision, e.g., because of usage barriers, and may help to balance the trade-offs between benefits for citizens and ecology and thus improve green spaces for both people and nature.","[Kraemer, Roland; Kabisch, Nadja] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Kraemer, Roland] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Monitoring & Explorat Technol, Leipzig, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Leipzig, Germany","Kraemer, R (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.; Kraemer, R (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Monitoring & Explorat Technol, Leipzig, Germany.",,"Kraemer, Roland/D-5369-2015","Kraemer, Roland/0000-0001-7115-833X",research project Environmental-Health Interactions in Cities (GreenEquityHEALTH) -Challenges for Human Well-Being under Global Changes - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LN1705A],"We thank Terra Concordia and the City of Leipzig for providing data.

Such trade-offs include choices between green/blue and non-green/blue projects, between broader land sparing vs. land sharing patterns, between satisfying the needs of the different inhabitants, but also between different ways of arranging the green and blue spaces. We analyze investment and planning initiatives in six case-study cities related to green and blue infrastructure (GBI) through the lens of a predefined set of questions an analytical framework based on the assumption that the flows of benefits from GBI to urban inhabitants and other stakeholders are mediated by three filters: infrastructures, institutions, and perceptions. The paper builds on the authors' own knowledge and experience with the analyzed case-study cities and beyond, a literature overview, a review of the relevant city documents, and interviews with key informants. The case studies indicate examples of initiatives that were intended to make GBI benefits available and accessible to urban inhabitants, in recognition of GBI as spaces with diverse functionality. Some case studies provide examples of trade-offs in trying to plan and design a green space for multiple private and public interests in densely built-up areas. The unintended consequences most typically resulted from the underappreciation of the complexity of social-ecological systems and more specifically the complexity of the involved infrastructures, institutions, and perceptions. The most important challenges addressed in the paper include trade-offs between the different ways of satisfying the residents' different needs related to the benefits from ecosystem services, ensuring proper recognition of the inhabitants' needs and perceptions, ecogentrification, caveats related to the formalization of informal spaces, and the need to consider temporal dynamics and cross-scale approaches that compromise different goals at different geographical scales.","[Kronenberg, Jakub; Koprowska, Karolina; Laszkiewicz, Edyta] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Social Ecol Syst Anal Lab, Lodz, Poland; [Andersson, Erik; McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Andersson, Erik] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Barton, David N.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Oslo, Norway; [Borgstrom, Sara T.; Bjorklund, Tove] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Langemeyer, Johannes] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Langemeyer, Johannes; Haase, Dagmar; Wolff, Manuel] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Haase, Dagmar; Wolff, Manuel] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Kennedy, Christopher; McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, New York, NY USA; [Stange, Erik E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Lillehammer, Norway","Kronenberg, J (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Social Ecol Syst Anal Lab, Lodz, Poland.",,,,"Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; German Aeronautics and Space Research Centre; National Science Centre (Poland)National Science Centre, Poland [2016/22/Z/NZ8/00003]; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Green Access project [2016-00331]; European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC)European Commission [818002-URBAG]; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1444755, 1927167, 1934933, 2029918]","We would like to thank Panagiota Kotsila and Ximena Giraldo Malca for supporting the Barcelona case study work.

While this debate seems to be largely situated in the field of natural sciences, this paper aims to also examine its social dimensions. To do so, we adopt a comparative discourse analysis with four cases of protected areas in France, Spain, and Scotland. We draw on a conceptual framework highlighting both the ecological and social factors underpinning the construction of environmental discourses. It notably emphasises the role of interests, ideas and institutions, and the power dynamics underpinning discoursecoalitions. We show how diverging discourses emerged, gained ground, coalesced and competed differently in different contexts, explaining the adoption of seemingly opposite discourses by protected area authorities.

The results update and revise Stake's list of six advocacies common in evaluation. The findings capture changes in evaluation language and substantive concerns over the last 15 years regarding evaluators' values and engagement. The conclusion affirms Stake's original overarching principle. In closing, I offer an additional concern toward saving the world not on Stake's list or that of the evaluators sampled: global sustainability and environmental justice in the face of the global pandemic and climate emergency.

Artistic expressions are part of the strategic toolkit of these movements. Art's capacity to foster cultural, cognitive and psychological changes is amply recognized by academics as well as by public in general. Nevertheless, the theoretical question of how art is linked to activist strategies and to socio-spatial transformations in environmental conflicts remains unexplored. This paper contributes to filling this gap by examining the emblematic struggle to stop the construction of a coal-export terminal in Oakland, CA. Our data includes 32 in-depth interviews of activists, artists and legal experts linked to the conflict surrounding this coal-export terminal. Non-participant observation and secondary data collection helped to contextualize the interviews. The results offer a timeline of the movement, a map of artistic expressions, and network analyses around the effects of environmental artistic activism. We demonstrate that creative activism has critical relevance for facilitating engagement, education and outreach of the anti-coal movement. Arts and its spatial impact benefited the movement by expanding its scale and making it more inclusive regarding demographics, including particularly women and youth of color. The use of the arts raised environmental and political awareness and enhanced public participation in decision making. The paper connects the literatures of environmental justice, environmental humanities and human geography. We contribute to the yet underdeveloped dialogue discussing the capacity of art to influence socio-ecological structures and socio-spatial dynamics in cases of environmental justice conflict.","[Sanz, Teresa; Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, 310 Social Sci Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Sanz, T (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",teresa.sanz@uab.cat; Beatriz.rodriguez@uab.cat,,,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [797444],"This research was possible thanks to CLAMOR project, funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement 797444.

Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an index of climate justice that includes factors of human development and climate action. The index was developed using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique and, in this study, assessed the climate justice of 198 nations. After the calculation, statistical analysis was used to compare the climate justice of the aforementioned countries, grouped by level of development and geographical location. The results obtained were: a) there is currently no nation that fully guarantees climate justice to its population; b) there is a difference in the performance of climate justice between the Annex I, Non-Annex I and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) groups; c) nations located in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Eastern Europe are similar in terms of climate justice index performance. The main contribution of this paper is in the fact that the proposed index can help policy-makers and national governments to define climate and development policies, creating a synergy between such policies.","[Furlan, Marcelo] Fed Univ Mato Grosso Sul UFMS, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Furlan, Marcelo; Mariano, Enzo] State Univ Sao Paulo UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Furlan, M (corresponding author), Fed Univ Mato Grosso Sul UFMS, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.; Furlan, M (corresponding author), State Univ Sao Paulo UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",marcelo.furlan@ufms.br; enzo.mariano@unesp.br,"Furlan, Marcelo/AAO-9134-2020; Mariano, Enzo B/J-6875-2012; Mariano, Enzo/AAQ-5890-2021","Furlan, Marcelo/0000-0001-7930-1997; Mariano, Enzo B/0000-0002-9577-3297; Mariano, Enzo/0000-0002-9577-3297",,,,140,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Changing climate and pasture conditions and societal changes continue to transform the operational environment of RM. These key drivers, and resulting transformations including alternative SES states, have not been studied in detail before. Our comprehensive literature review and interviews with herders reveal that land use, climate change, and governance drive the emergence of SES tipping points. The basis of successful RM depends on the quantity and quality of pastures to secure animal fitness. However, intensive forestry, extreme weather, and predators constrain the availability of forage and suitable calving grounds. Maintaining RM by means of predation compensation mechanisms and regular supplementary winter feeding to adapt to changes brought about by land use and warming climate comprises an alternative system state. However, if negative impacts increase remarkably or rapidly and compensatory mechanisms become insufficient, long-term impacts on system identity, and even local collapses, are expected. Although some environmental and societal changes are perceived as pressures by herders, they can be beneficial for other livelihoods in the region. Therefore, our study raises questions for future studies on social justice, such as who has the right to decide what constitutes a desirable system state, or what collaborative efforts to maintain RM in Fennoscandia would entail. Our work is applicable also in other Arctic/sub-Arctic regions where nature-based livelihoods, such as small-scale forestry and agriculture, hunting, traditional fishing, and gathering are practiced.","[Landauer, Mia; Rasmus, Sirpa; Forbes, Bruce C.] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Landauer, Mia] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Syst Risk & Resilience Grp, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Landauer, M (corresponding author), Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland.; Landauer, M (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Syst Risk & Resilience Grp, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",mia.landauer@ulapland.fi; sirpa.rasmus@ulapland.fi; bforbes@ulapland.fi,"; Forbes, Bruce/L-4431-2013","Rasmus, Sirpa/0000-0001-8106-0299; Landauer, Mia/0000-0002-7153-8495; Forbes, Bruce/0000-0002-4593-5083",University of Lapland,Open access funding provided by University of Lapland.,,103,0,0,15,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Feeling comfortable delivering CCE was correlated with reported resource availability, with most teachers considering only basic literacy was a greater funding priority. Teachers supported an action-based CCE curriculum including issues of global social justice, beginning in primary school with mitigation projects such as conservation, local tree-planting and family advocacy. Local campaigning (e.g. legal demonstration) was considered appropriate around the primary/secondary transition, with most supporting inclusion of civil disobedience but indicating this should begin at secondary school (11+ years).

However, there are various uncertainties and challenges associated with the impacts of displacement and attachments to place. In this context, it is useful to study past examples of relocation to understand how these challenges have been addressed. This paper draws on a case study relocation scheme which took place in Ireland following major flooding in 1954. This represented a radical and comprehensive approach to relocation which sought to address the root causes of vulnerability. The analysis shows that this comprehensive approach was made possible through a connection between managed retreat and land reform. The scheme also faced opposition linked to attachments to place and property. This led to compromises and a failure to fully address the effects of flooding on livelihoods but contributed to resilience through ensuring that family and community ties remained intact. The paper's distinctive contributions are its analysis of the requirements of transformative approaches to adaptation and relocation, its identification of challenges associated with place and property even in the context of such transformative approaches, and its adding of historical depth to contemporary debates on climate adaptation.","[Tubridy, Daniel; Scott, Mark; Lennon, Mick] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland","Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland.",tubridyd@tcd.ie; mark.scott@ucd.ie; michael.lennon@ucd.ie,,"Lennon, Mick/0000-0001-8613-092X; Scott, Mark/0000-0002-8053-5720",Irish Centre for Applied Geosciences (iCRAG) under Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC2092],UThis research was supported by Irish Centre for Applied Geosciences (iCRAG) under Science Foundation Ireland [grant number 13/RC2092].,,52,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0266-5433,1466-4518,,PLAN PERSPECT,Plan.

Climate change can contribute to housing insecurity in multiple ways, such as when insurance rates increase for low-income homeowners living in flood-prone areas, or when disasters destroy existing affordable housing stock. These impacts can trigger the displacement of individual households or entire communities, requiring local governments to plan ahead for community-centered housing solutions. This article (1) explores the affordable housing crisis in the USA and the compounding impacts of climate change; (2) analyzes the concept of receiving communities and the unique considerations for preparing and investing in affordable housing; and (3) recommends how local governments can use new and existing planning, funding, and legal tools to ensure an effective and inclusive housing strategy for receiving communities.","[Li, Jennifer] Georgetown Univ, Harrison Inst Publ Law, Law Ctr, 600 New Jersey Ave NW,Ste 120, Washington, DC 20001 USA; [Spidalieri, Katie] Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Climate Ctr, Law Ctr, 600 New Jersey Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA","Li, J (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Harrison Inst Publ Law, Law Ctr, 600 New Jersey Ave NW,Ste 120, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",Jennifer.Li@georgetown.edu; Katie.Spidalieri@georgetown.edu,,,,,,46,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

In these times, citizenship education seems more important than ever. How can this citizenship education relate to mathematics and science learning? The research project MaSDiV (Supporting mathematics and science teachers in addressing diversity and promoting fundamental values) connected mathematics and science with citizenship education by modeling real-life problems relevant to society. In this paper, we present the foundational design features of the PD course as well the results from the accompanying evaluation of this PD course, which was implemented by partners in six countries to support teachers in connecting mathematics and science education with citizenship education. More specifically, we investigate how participating teachers experienced the PD program; how their self-efficacy beliefs, learning-related beliefs, as well as teaching practices change; and which factors contributed to that change. In order to investigate the outcome of the PD program, we surveyed N = 311 mathematics and science teachers' pre- and post-participation of the PD in six different European countries. Among others, our results show that in general, most participating teachers reported a high overall satisfaction with the course across all six participating countries. They also indicate that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about using relevant contexts, their learning-related beliefs about the benefits of using contexts, as well as their own teaching practice changed significantly after participating in the MaSDiV PD course.","[Maass, Katja; Straser, Oliver] Univ Educ Freiburg, Int Ctr STEM Educ, Kunzenweg 21, D-79117 Freiburg, Germany; [Sorge, Stefan; Hesse, Alice] IPN Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ, Dept Phys Educ, Olshausenstr 62, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Romero-Ariza, Marta] Univ Jaen, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain","Maass, K (corresponding author), Univ Educ Freiburg, Int Ctr STEM Educ, Kunzenweg 21, D-79117 Freiburg, Germany.",maass@ph-freiburg.de; sorge@leibniz-ipn.de; mromero@ujaen.es; hesse@leibniz-ipn.de; oliver.straser@ph-freiburg.de,"Sorge, Stefan/AAD-9331-2019","Sorge, Stefan/0000-0001-9915-228X",European Union Erasmus+ Programme [582943-EPP-1-2016-2-DE-EPPKA3-PI-POLICY]; Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

These include the accelerated rate of climate change, pandemic threats, systemic racism, growing health and social inequities, and the regulation of new technologies to ensure an equitable future 'for all.' In nursing codes of ethics, administration, education, policies, and practice, social justice is often claimed to be a core value, yet it is rarely contextualized by philosophical or theoretical underpinnings. It appears that nurses' commitment to social justice may stem more from a penchant for 'doing good' than an attempt to explore, understand, and enact what is meant by social justice from an ontological, epistemological, and methodological perspective. We contend that the dominance of a human science perspective in nursing contributes to a narrow definition of health and relegates many issues central to social justice to the margins of nurses' care. In this article, we explore how the focus on 'the human' in the human science perspective may not only be limiting the capacity of nurses to develop strategies to adequately address social injustice, but in some instances, direct nurses to contribute to their very reproduction. We suggest that a critical interrogation of this human-centric hegemony can identify avenues of rupture and introduce posthumanism as an additional philosophical perspective for consideration to help bridge the human-social divide.","[Adam, Simon; Juergensen, Linda; Mallette, Claire] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada","Adam, S (corresponding author), York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",siadam@yorku.ca,,"Adam, Simon/0000-0002-3043-3013",,,,59,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-7681,1466-769X,,NURS PHILOS,Nurs.

The determinants and public health outcomes of recurrent home flooding in urban contexts, however, are not well understood. A household survey was used to assess neighborhood and household level determinants of recurrent home flooding in Detroit, MI. Survey activities were conducted from 2012 to 2020. Researchers collected information on past flooding, housing conditions and public health outcomes. Using the locations of homes, a hot spot analysis of flooding was performed to find areas of high and low risk. Survey data were linked to environmental and neighborhood data and associations were tested using regression methods. 4803 households participated in the survey. Flooding information was available for 3842 homes. Among these, 2085 (54.26%) reported experiencing pluvial flooding. Rental occupied units were more likely to report flooding than owner occupied homes (Odd ratio (OR) 1.72 [95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.49, 1.98]). Housing conditions such as poor roof quality and cracks in basement walls influenced home flooding risk. Homes located in census tracts with increased percentages of owner occupied units (vs. rentals) had a lower odds of flooding (OR 0.92 [95% (CI) 0.86, 0.98]). Household factors were found the be more predictive of flooding than neighborhood factors in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Flooding and housing conditions associated with home flooding were associated with asthma cases. Recurrent home flooding is far more prevalent than previously thought. Programs that support recovery and which focus on home improvement to prevent flooding, particularly by landlords, might benefit the public health. These results draw awareness and urgency to problems of urban flooding and public health in other areas of the country confronting the compounding challenges of aging infrastructure, disinvestment and climate change.","[Larson, Peter S.; Gronlund, Carina] Univ Michigan, Survey Res Ctr, Inst Social Res, Social Environm & Hlth Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Larson, Peter S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Thompson, Lyke; Washington, Ramona] Wayne State Univ, Ctr Urban Studies, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Sampson, Natalie] Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Fairlane Ctr South, 19000 Hubbard Dr, Dearborn, MI 48126 USA; [Thorsby, Jamie Steis; Lyon, Natalie; Miller, Carol] Wayne State Univ, Hlth Urban Waters, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Larson, PS (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Survey Res Ctr, Inst Social Res, Social Environm & Hlth Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Larson, PS (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",anfangen@umich.edu; gronlund@umich.edu; Lyke@wayne.edu; nsampson@umich.edu; as0293@wayne.edu; jamie.steis@wayne.edu; natalie.lyon@wayne.edu; ab1421@wayne.edu,,,Healthy Urban Waters program at Wayne State University - Erb Family Foundation; National Institute of Environmental Health SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [R00ES026198]; University of Michigan Institute for Global Change Biology,"This work was supported by the Healthy Urban Waters program at Wayne State University, funded by the Erb Family Foundation.

We identify some of the outcomes and barriers of these projects in relation to promoting wellbeing through work, transport, participation and green spaces for food production, biodiversity and recreation. Projects' achievements are contextualised in light of the urgent imperative to tackle climate change and against a background of social inequality. Liminal community projects are structurally constrained in their potential to create wider systemic changes. However, the projects' potential to promote wellbeing among their participants can intersect with climate change mitigation when systemic and wide-ranging changes are adopted. These changes must involve a meaningful shift towards an economy that centres wellbeing, framed through principles of environmental justice and promoting social equity.","[Meyerricks, Svenja] Ctr Human Ecol, Pearce Inst, Glasgow G51 3UU, Lanark, Scotland; [White, Rehema M.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland","Meyerricks, S (corresponding author), Ctr Human Ecol, Pearce Inst, Glasgow G51 3UU, Lanark, Scotland.",mail@svenjameyerricks.net; rehema.white@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,Scottish Government; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/H029354/1],"This research was funded through a collaborative PhD studentship by the Scottish Government and the Economic and Social Research Council, grant number ES/H029354/1.",,76,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,13,,,,,,,7357,10.3390/su13137357,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TF7QE,WOS:000670911200001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

If modern slaves were a country, they would be the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, after China and the United States. Concurrently, anthropogenic changes to the global ecosystem have significant impacts on human life, creating vulnerability and displacement that drive modern slavery. This circular relationship is explored through the interaction of contemporary slavery with multiple anthropogenic processes recognized as planetary boundaries. It is a key assertion that the study of human rights (and slavery in particular), and the study of anthropogenic impacts, have been falsely seen as distinct and separate issues. In this Perspective, we map an unfolding and extremely troubling nexus between slavery, environmental degradation, and carbon emissions. We break this challenge down into the interconnected processes of extreme weather, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and pollution from manufacturing and resource extraction. We discuss how climate change is a threat multiplier to slavery, but also how slavery is a threat multiplier to the causes of climate change. We conclude by offering compelling policy implications to address these threat multipliers, to help guide future research and policy pathways. Abolishing slavery is shown to be one of the most effective instruments for climate change mitigation, especially given that the costs of ending slavery seem on par to about $20 billion, or the expense of a single large nuclear power plant.","[Bales, Kevin] Univ Nottingham, Rights Lab, Nottingham, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark","Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,33,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

How can planners minimize harm and reduce risk, given the state leadership's unwillingness to undertake climate planning? One place to start is to investigate residents' climate change beliefs to understand whether they share the state's climate antagonism and then use this information to shape a planning response. In this study, I analyzed a survey (n = 1,053) to ask: What are Texans' perceptions of climate change, and how can planners use this knowledge to create strategies to catalyze climate planning? Respondents expressed strong agreement about negative effects of climate change and increased frequency of extreme weather. They believed that climate change is due at least in part to human activity, and they expressed robust support for climate-related planning activities. These responses sharply differ from the state's approach. However, despite agreement about climate issues, respondents did not identify climate change as a major concern about the future. This contrast suggests an opportunity for new climate-related communication frames to bridge the gap between climate perceptions and planning action. Takeaway for practice These findings inform three recommendations: better connect climate change impacts to everyday concerns, including housing, air quality, and health; emphasize common ground about benefits provided by nature, especially related to health; and use community engagement to refine these frames. I propose that planners can accelerate climate planning by following the lead of other disciplines that emphasize human health impacts of the climate crisis. In addition, planners can strengthen climate planning by extending environmental planning's use of local knowledge from environmental health, urban heat planning, and climate-related land use planning to climate planning more broadly.","[Lieberknecht, Katherine] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Lieberknecht, K (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",klieberknecht@utexas.edu,,,University of Texas at Austin's Bridging Barriers Grand Challenge Initiative,This work was supported by The University of Texas at Austin's Bridging Barriers Grand Challenge Initiative.,,142,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

To this end, a bibliometric and a cluster analysis by fractional accounting have been carried out using two of the most important databases: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The research found and studied 140 documents from WoS Core Collection and 193 from Scopus. Results The results show a continual increase in the number of articles published and citations received during the whole period studied. The U.S., U.K., Germany and China have been shown to be the most productive countries and there is a predominance of North American organizations supporting and fostering research on these topics. Conclusions The main contribution of this article is the analysis of new tendencies. The trend shows a transition from concepts such as vulnerability, climate change, land degradation, refugees and security to others such as concepts such as international migration, climate justice, sustainability, human rights and disaster risk reduction. Future research in this field should address the comparison of results from research focused on human beings to a focus on other living beings.","[Milan-Garcia, Juan; Caparros-Martinez, Jose Luis; Rueda-Lopez, Nuria; de Pablo Valenciano, Jaime] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Bussiness, Almeria, Spain","Milan-Garcia, J (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Bussiness, Almeria, Spain.",jmg483@ual.es,,,,,,65,0,0,2,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-8603,,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

It is challenging, however, to navigate through the wide range of possible measures, taking into account the efficacy, economic impact and social justice aspects of these measures, as well as the governance requirements for implementing them. This article presents the approach of selecting and analysing adaptation measures to increasing extreme weather events caused by ongoing climate change that was developed and applied in the H2020 project BINGO (Bringing Innovation to Ongoing Water Management). The purpose of this project is (a) to develop an integrated participatory approach for selecting and evaluating adaptation measures, (b) to apply and evaluate the approach across six case-study river basins across Europe, and (c) to support decision-making towards adaptation capturing the diversity, the different circumstances and challenges river basins face across Europe. It combines three analyses: governance, socio-economic and social justice The governance analysis focuses on the requirements associated with the measures and the extent to which these requirements are met at the research sites. The socio-economic impact focuses on the efficacy of the measures in reducing the risks and the broad range of tools available to compare the measures on their societal impact. Finally, a tentative social justice analysis focuses on the distributive impacts of the adaptation measures. In the summary of results, we give an overview of the outcome of the different analyses. In the conclusion, we briefly assess the main pros and cons of the different analyses that were conducted. The main conclusion is that although the research sites were very different in both the challenges and the institutional context, the approach presented here yielded decision-relevant outcomes.","[Van Alphen, Henk-Jan; Bergsma, Emmy] KWR Water Res Inst, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Strehl, Clemens; Vollmer, Fabian] IWW Water Ctr, D-45476 Mulheim, Germany; [Interwies, Eduard; Petersen, Anasha; Goerlitz, Stefan] InterSus Sustainabil Serv, D-10405 Berlin, Germany; [Locatelli, Luca; Martinez Puentes, Montse] Aquatec Suez Spain, Barcelona 08038, Spain; [Guerrero Hidalga, Maria] CETAQUA Water Technol Ctr, Barcelona 08940, Spain; [Giannakis, Elias] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Scheibel, Marc] Wupperverband, D-42289 Wuppertal, Germany; [Kristvik, Erle] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Rocha, Fernanda] Lab Nacl Engn Civil, P-1700066 Lisbon, Portugal","Van Alphen, HJ (corresponding author), KWR Water Res Inst, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands.",henk-jan.van.alphen@kwrwater.nl,,"Giannakis, Elias/0000-0002-1779-9811",BINGO European H2020 project [641739],This research has been supported by the BINGO European H2020 project (grant no. 641739).,,67,0,0,1,1,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

The Kyoto Protocol's failure to curb the rising greenhouse gases emissions pushed the UNFCCC-led negotiations towards a more flexible, non-binding agreement at the Paris COP21 meeting in 2015. The Paris Agreement's hybrid approach to climate change governance, where flexible measures like the nationally determined commitments are balanced against the ambition of limiting the global temperature within the two-degree range, ensured the emergence of an increasingly complex and multi-stakeholder climate change regime. The article outlines the roadmap of the transition from the top-down approach of Kyoto Protocol to the legally non-binding, bottom-up approaches adopted for the post-Paris phase. The article outlines the post-Paris developments in international climate politics, which hold long-term geopolitical and geoeconomic implications. The article focuses on the fundamental shifts and balances within the UNFCCC architecture and examines the four fundamental features of this transition-the interpretation of differentiation and common but differentiated responsibilities, the evolving role of emerging economies in the negotiations, the rising profile of non-party stakeholders in shaping the climate action strategies and the emergence of climate justice movements as an alternate site of climate action.","[Thakur, Saurabh] Natl Maritime Fdn, Blue Econ & Climate Change, New Delhi, India","Thakur, S (corresponding author), Natl Maritime Fdn, Blue Econ & Climate Change, New Delhi, India.",thakcur@gmail.com,,,,,,78,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0974-9284,0975-2684,,INDIA Q,India Q.,,,,,,,,,,,9.74928E+15,10.1177/09749284211027252,,JUL 2021,18,International Relations,International Relations,TM6WN,WOS:000675690600001,,,,,2021-08-07,

In the United States, his teachings on these topics have generated some controversy among right-leaning figures. In this study, I look at whether this controversy is reflected in mass opinion about Pope Francis. Using data from three national surveys of Americans, I find that individuals who identify with the political right evaluate Francis more negatively. Qualifying this, Catholic religious affiliation weakens the tendency for right-wing identifiers to evaluate Francis more negatively, while strengthening the tendency for those high in religiosity to evaluate the pope positively. Finally, consistent with the idea that politically aware individuals are more likely to make ideologically informed judgments, the relationship between identification with the political right and negative evaluations of Pope Francis was stronger among the politically engaged.","[Federico, Christopher M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Federico, CM (corresponding author), Dept Polit Sci, 1414 Social Sci Bldg,267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",federico@umn.edu,,,,,,54,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8294,1468-5906,,J SCI STUD RELIG,J.

However, energy continues to be taught as an abstract concept that removes itself from the social implications energy systems have on society, in particular toward Indigenous communities. Given the importance of integrating discussions around equity into our science courses, in this study we propose a way in which energy justice can be redefined and included in physics classrooms. Redefining energy justice into physics classrooms allows us to connect energy justice to existing energy physics curriculum and lessons plans. In Summer 2020, 22 physics teachers participated in a professional development that centered on discussions around energy and equity. We analyzed and coded teachers' dialogues and conversations around energy and equity to identify energy justice pillars. The energy justice pillars we identified formed the basis of an energy justice framework that redefines energy justice for physics classrooms. This energy justice framework allows us to bridge the separation between physics and social justice, as they continue to be viewed as two separate schools of thought in the field of physics.","[Hernandez, Jessica; Scherr, Rachel] Univ Washington, Sch Sci Technol & Math, Div Phys Sci, 18115 Campus Way NE, Bothell, WA 98011 USA; [Robertson, Amy D.] Seattle Pacific Univ, Dept Phys, Seattle, WA 98119 USA","Hernandez, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Sci Technol & Math, Div Phys Sci, 18115 Campus Way NE, Bothell, WA 98011 USA.",jhernan@uw.edu,,"Hernandez, Jessica/0000-0003-3825-9432",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1936601],"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), DRL No. 1936601.",,44,0,0,0,0,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply-demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply-demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio-demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot- and coldspots of supply-demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot- and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio-demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate-regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply-demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in nature-based solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices.","[Herreros-Cantis, Pablo; McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, 79 5th Ave 16, New York, NY 10003 USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-11419 Stockholm, Sweden","Herreros-Cantis, P (corresponding author), New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, 79 5th Ave 16, New York, NY 10003 USA.",herrerop@newschool.edu,,"Herreros Cantis, Pablo/0000-0002-2278-0648","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research NetworkNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1444755]; U.S. NSF Accel-Net program NATURA [1927167]; U.S. NSF Convergence program [1934933]; BiodivERsA COFUND; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; German Aerospace CenterHelmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR); National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; SMARTer Greener Cities project through the Nordforsk Sustainable Urban Development and Smart Cities grant program","Research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network (NSF grant SES 1444755), the U.S. NSF Accel-Net program NATURA (grant 1927167), and U.S. NSF Convergence program (grant 1934933).

The 2019 conference focused on assessing ecosystem health based on 61 indicators. Although there has been considerable improvement in the Detroit River since the 1960s, much additional cleanup is needed to restore ecosystem health. Western Lake Erie is now at risk of crossing several potential tipping points caused by the interactions of a variety of drivers and their stresses. This assessment identified eight environmental and natural resource challenges: climate change; population growth/transportation expansion/land use changes; chemicals of concern; human health/environmental justice; aquatic invasive species; habitat loss/degradation; nonpoint source pollution; and eutrophication/harmful algal blooms. Specific recommendations for addressing each challenge were also made. Climate change is the most pressing environmental challenge of our time and considered a ``threat multiplier whereby warmer, wetter, and more extreme climatic conditions amplify other threats such as poor air quality effects on vulnerable residents, species changes, and nonpoint source runoff and combined sewer overflow events that contribute to eutrophication and can manifest as harmful algal blooms. Our assessment found that investments in monitoring and evaluation are insufficient and that the region's intellectual and environmental capital is not being leveraged sufficiently to address current challenges. Continued investment in this transnational network is essential to support ecosystembased management. (C) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evidence increasingly points to social movements and mobilized publics as critical drivers of change, including transformative energy transitions. Yet STS' focus on science and expertise can miss the significance of the public's role in leading and shaping energy transitions. This paper explores how STS considers public engagement and disparities between project-specific issues and broader energy objectives, such as addressing global climate change. Drawing on research about public participation, mobilized publics, and social movements, the paper examines how expanding the STS lens of analysis can ensure that the public's role in energy transitions is fully assessed and reflected. The paper also discusses future research approaches and avenues for more interdisciplinary collaboration, which will be advantageous in investigating transformative energy transition pathways.","[Armstrong, John H.] Seattle Univ, Environm Studies, Seattle, WA 98122 USA","Armstrong, JH (corresponding author), Seattle Univ, Environm Studies, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",jarmstrong@seattleu.edu,,,,,,130,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The concept of sustainability is central to these efforts, as climate adaptation discussions are often framed within the context of economic resilience, environmental protection, and social vulnerability. For urban centers, the climate change issue presents unique challenges for each of these dimensions; however, its potential impacts on marginalized populations are extensive. This study draws from the 'just sustainabilities' (Agyeman, Bullard, and Evans 2003) framework and applies the concepts of distributive and procedural justice to examine whether, and to what extent, U.S. cities prioritize social equity concerns in adaptation plans. We perform a qualitative analysis of climate adaptation plans prepared by 22 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. We find that social equity concerns are particularly prominent in local-level climate adaptation discussions relative to those concerning environmental quality and economic development.","[Fiack, Duran] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Cumberbatch, Jeremy; Sutherland, Michael] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Macaulay Honors Coll, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Zerphey, Nadine] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Bronx, NY 10468 USA","Fiack, D (corresponding author), CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",Duran.Fiack@lehman.cuny.edu,,,,,,102,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,AUG,2021,115,,,,,,,,103235,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103235,,,11,Urban Studies,Urban Studies,TE6BB,WOS:000670095100011,,,,,2021-08-07,

However, PAs are criticized for their limited ecological effectiveness and their negative social impacts. This article seeks to provide an overview on the contested nature of PAs and places PAs in the tension field of conservation and development, which are diverging forces specifically in the Global South. A reconciliation of PAs as parts of a wider landscape of interlinked social-ecological systems may increase the potential of PAs to contribute to the sustainable development goals, including the creation of sustainable human-nature relationships, environmental health and landscape resilience. The environmental justice framework appears useful in the endeavour to improve the social-ecological integrity of current conservation practises and to increase the ability of PA systems to withstand shocks. Considering PAs as systems in which people and nature interact in manifold ways may help increase their integrity, but understanding these interactions requires sustainability researchers and conservation practitioners to recognize the plurality in value towards nature, nature understanding and conceptualisations. Such deep understanding seems pivotal in working towards synergies of sustainable use, biocultural diversity and wilderness. Concludingly, this article emphasizes the need for holistic approaches rather than sectoral specialisations and radicalisations to achieve arrays of sustainability goals.

We visited disadvantaged communities in the San Joaquin Valley of California and interviewed local stakeholders (community members and leaders, policy advocates, attorneys, and educators). Then we analyzed a corpus related to disadvantaged communities from a pool of California-related publications containing 154,000 scientific papers, 2.6 million newspaper articles, and 11,000 state legislation bills from 2017 to 2020 to estimate the frequency and quality of disadvantaged community representation. Here we present our findings describing the biases and gaps of knowledge by scientific papers, California newspaper articles, and legislation bills with respect to disadvantaged communities in California, and we suggest opportunities for scientists, media communicators, and policymakers to amplify the voices of these stakeholders. In all corpus categories, disadvantaged communities are underrepresented: about one in four Californians live in disadvantaged communities, but only one in 2000 news articles and scientific papers cover them. The concerns and priorities of disadvantaged communities do not match the public perspective of them depicted by the corpus. Developing effective policies requires addressing placespecific nuances and co-occurrence of structural inequities in partnership with local stakeholders. Holistic coverage in newspapers and community-based approaches are necessary platforms to increase awareness and sensibility about disadvantaged communities, helping tailor policy solutions, and building the political leverage needed to implement them.","[Fernandez-Bou, Angel Santiago; Flores-Landeros, Humberto; Medellin-Azuara, Josue] Univ Calif Merced, Civil & Environm Engn & Environm Syst Grad Progra, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Ortiz-Partida, J.

Nevertheless, no in-depth analysis has thus far examined the relationship between people suffering energy poverty and their carbon dioxide emissions. This study addresses the issue by presenting a novel approach to measuring people's basic carbon needs (BCN), which are defined as the amount of carbon emissions needed to achieve (socially and materially) adequate levels of domestic energy services. The results, using Japan as a case study, reveal the differences in people's BCN based on climatic, socio-demographic, and dwelling factors, showing that people in energy poverty need greater carbon emissions to fulfil their basic energy needs than the affluent population. In upcoming lowcarbon energy transitions, people's BCN must be reduced while satisfying their basic energy needs. However, this study shows that the carbon intensity of domestic energy services for energy poverty households is high, leading carbon mitigation policies such as carbon pricing to adversely affect them without suitable countermeasures. Hence, ensuring access to low-carbon energy for all, including the energy poor, is essential to engender an inclusive low-carbon energy transition.","[Okushima, Shinichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Ten Nodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan","Okushima, S (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Ten Nodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",okushima@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,"GrantinAid for Scientific Research (JSPSKAKENHI)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP17K00679, JP21H03667]",This work was supported by the GrantinAid for Scientific Research (JSPSKAKENHI) [Grant No. JP17K00679 and JP21H03667] .,,112,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Uncontrolled fires reflect new ecologies of the Anthropocene, driven by interactions of multiple actors and sectors across scales. They threaten the ecological integrity of tropical forests, impact global climate regimes and importantly cause considerable social and economic burdens. Numerous smallholder farming communities throughout the forested tropics experience the immediate place-based damages of uncontrolled fires and increasingly flammable landscapes. However, these burdens remain largely 'invisible' as leading narratives concentrate on losses accrued at aggregate scales, including to climate and biodiversity. Rather, smallholder farmers are often cast as culprits of contagion rooted in colonial condemnation of their customary fire-based agricultural practices. We use an environmental justice lens, notably the dimensions of recognition and distribution, to reveal the distributional burdens of uncontrolled fires for these land managers. We use empirical data from four case studies in three countries: Brazil, Madagascar and the Philippines, to explore the i) burdens of uncontrolled fire, ii) changing risks, iii) drivers and iv) responses to uncontrolled fire, and finally, the v) level of smallholder dependence on intentional fire. We show that place-based burdens of uncontrolled landscape fire are significant, including in landscapes where fire frequency is low. Burdens are both material and non-material and include infringements on food security, health, livelihoods, social relations and the burden of prohibitive fire policy itself. Equitable responses to uncontrolled fires must be sensitive to the distinctions between fire types. Further, we suggest that through bringing visibility to the place-based burdens of uncontrolled fires, we can begin to co-design resilient responses that avoid placing the final burden of risk reduction on to marginalized smallholder farming communities.

The poor results of the mitigation policies and the more destructive climate change impacts nowadays give climate change adaptation a privileged place in political discourse and in academic literature as a desirable and necessary goal. This article discusses that idea. Based on a review of the authors who contributed to the genesis of adaptation thinking, the origin of the concept, its first uses in evolutionary biology and its subsequent incorporation into the literature and policy on climate change of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are traced, in order to recover the critique from Latin American and anglophones authors to the use of biological categories to explain social processes, as well as the multiplicity of projects and interests that are legitimized and adopted in the name of adaptation. Finally, it is suggested to rethink the usefulness of adaptation from a transdisciplinary perspective, that replaces biological reductionism and commits itself to socio-environmental justice.","[Islas Vargas, Maritza] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Vargas, MI (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",islasvm@gmail.com,,,,,,64,0,0,7,7,"FAC LATINOAMERICANA CIENCIAS SOCIALES-FLACSO, ECUADOR",QUITO,"CALLE PRADERA E7-174 & DIEGO ALMAGRO, QUITO, 00000, ECUADOR",1390-6631,,,LET VERDES,Let Verdes,SEP-FEB,2021,,28,,,,,9,30,,10.17141/letrasverdes.28.2020.4333,,,22,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SA4AA,WOS:000649238600001,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-08-07,

It addresses the sustainability of communities, since without them there is no real human future. It also fits current concerns about climate change and general sustainability. However, our understanding of the characteristics of sustainable communities is still insufficient, as is evidenced by the different perspectives extant in the HFE literature. This paper provides a further perspective based on systems ergonomics, intended both to extend our socio-technical understanding and to assist HFE practitioners in contributing to a broad approach by which to contribute to the never-ending renewal process for these communities. Without such an approach many communities will become unsustainable, with collapse as their end, as Tainter originally, icily, explained (Tainter 1988). The paper begins with a definition of a 'sustainable community', including its legal basis. Its sustainability goals are outlined, based mainly on principles of social justice, since without people there is no community. Then there is a discussion of the characteristics of sustainable communities, the classes of resources available to maintain sustainability, and some of the complexities and hindrances to this maintenance. The last sections link this conceptual landscape to HFE practice by outlining approaches and processes that move from the conceptual landscape in this paper to current practice.","[Sinclair, M.
