AB My color photography is a theater of psychological and physical transformations that reveal a luminescent excess. This excess combines both the civilized and the animalistic. For my photography series the Gestation Project I choreographed groups of ten to thirty naked pregnant women in San Francisco public spaces such as the zoo, hair salons, bookstores, nightclubs, boxing rings, and empty auditoriums. The women's pregnant bodies in community render the private explicitly public. While exploring the erasure of public spaces and our potential for reimagining our collective future, my article conjures the fertility of environmental justice within the commons. Juxtaposing bodies / body fragments with organic and synthetic materials and environments, I play with the illusory distinctions between "them" and "us." By recognizing how vulnerability can engender a humane global culture, ecofeminist strategies for living our principles without self-censorship, we can hold ourselves accountable as the fear of perceived difference becomes more urgent in our technoeuphoric media-saturated age. A cross-cultural, interspecies approach to climate-crisis mitigation integrates individual, community, and infrastructural change. From this visceral commitment, we can cultivate regenerative economic tools for biocultural transformation, integrating rather than competing with our natural environment or isolating ourselves from it.

TI Water in the Lumbee World: A River and Its People in a Time of Change

DT Article
ID NORTH-CAROLINA
AB This article explores relationships between Lumbee people and the riverine landscapes of their home. I draw upon my lived experience as a Lumbee person and my training as an environmental scientist to evaluate the riverine environment of the Lumbee River as both a template for change and a fragile resource. The river shapes Lumbee culture and community, on the one hand, and it is subject to human impacts, on the other. Here, I examine the bidirectional relationship between river and people in a historical context and also in the context of contemporary issues facing Lumbee people, who collectively make up one of the largest Indigenous groups in the United States and constitute the nation's largest non-federally recognized Indian tribe. I frame historical issues related to isolation and connectivity of the landscape around a novel topological analysis of historical maps. I use contemporary issues, including industrialized agriculture and climate change, to emphasize the complex and evolving relationship between Lumbee people and their riverine environment. Recent events, including Indigenous resistance to fossil fuel pipelines and flooding of the community following Hurricane Matthew, reveal challenges and opportunities faced by the tribe in the areas of environmental justice and sovereignty.

AB This paper explores the complex heterogeneous experiences of flood impacts based on a bio-psychosocial model of socio-economic, demographic, behavioural and environmental factors. Using ordinary least squares regression on a cross-sectional survey of 1003 individuals, flood impacts in three contiguous coastal neighbourhoods in Lagos, Nigeria, were modelled. The results show that approximately 52% of the variability in flood impact was accounted for by education, age, family structure, ethnicity, personal health concern and income. While involvement in coping was not a significant predictor of flood impacts, relocation emerged as a strong predictor. The inclusion of behavioural factors did not change the magnitude and significance of the relationship between demographic factors and flood impacts. However, the effects of age, education and personal health concern disappeared when environmental factors were controlled. The overall importance of the predictors for determining flood impact in decreasing order is as follows: income > coping strategies > ethnicity = participation in community development > family structure > personal health concerns > housing quality > reasons for living in residential locality > neighbourhood vulnerability to flood > housing vulnerability to flood.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; WELCOME; HEALTH
AB Emerging research on Anthropocene urbanism shows a commitment to human-nature centred futures and environmental justice but fails to engage with the language of race. Thinking the Anthropocene through race, however, has the potential to decolonise dominant apocalyptic narratives of climate change and provide insights into imaginaries of diverse urban futures. This paper argues that such futures run through entangled Indigenous and Ethnic minority worlds in white settler cities but are often explored separately. To entangle these worlds, I introduce and develop the concept of affective ecologies or sentient embodiments of ecological interdependency grounded in everyday urban life. The paper draws on in-depth interviews, focus groups, archival photographs as well as participatory photographs/video/films taken by racialised Indigenous peoples, ethnic minority migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Darwin, a tropical north Australian city. I braid stories of co-becomings with this Saltwater Country prone to anthropogenic climate change by focusing on two events Loving Country and Listening to Old Man Rock. The findings provide new insights into urban cosmopolitics that calls for articulating, reassembling and co-composing plural modes of coexistence in the Anthropocene.

AB Climate change impacts island communities all over the world. Sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, and changes in distribution and health of marine organisms are among the most significant processes affecting island communities worldwide. On islands of the Caribbean and southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO), however, today's climate change impacts are magnified by historical environmental injustice and colonial legacies, which have heightened the vulnerability of human and other biotic communities. For some islands, archaeological and paleoecological research offers an important record of precolonial climate change and its interplay with human lives and landscapes. The archaeological record suggests strategies and mechanisms that can inform discussions of resilience in the face of climate change. We detail climate-related challenges facing island Caribbean and SWIO communities using archaeological and paleoecological evidence for past climate change and human response and argue that these cannot be successfully addressed without an understanding of the processes that have, over time, disrupted livelihoods, reshaped land- and seascapes, threatened intergenerational ecological knowledge transfer, and led to increased inequality and climate vulnerability.

   SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT
AB Background: Environmental factors are a major cause of poor health worldwide. The most solid evidence is for air pollution, leading to increased disability-adjusted life years. Outdoor temperature and other seasonal climate changes may also influence cardiovascular health, according to their direct modulation of air pollution. Moreover, an increasing body of evidence associates environmental exposure to noise with poor cardiovascular outcome, and in particular with hypertension.
   Methods: This review is aimed at reviewing current evidence about the role of these environmental factors in cardiovascular disease and specifically hypertension. In particular, the impact of air pollution, with its short-term and long-term effects, the outdoor temperature and noise pollution will be investigated.
   Conclusions: People belonging to low social classes, as well as children, women, older people and those with established cardiovascular diseases, seem to have a greater susceptibility to the effects of environmental stressors, recalling the concept of "environmental justice". The accumulating strong scientific evidence may thus support public health policies aimed at reducing social inequalities in cardiovascular health.

AB An appreciation of the psychological impacts of global climate change entails recognizing the complexity and multiple meanings associated with climate change; situating impacts within other social, technological, and ecological transitions; and recognizing mediators and moderators of impacts. This article describes three classes of psychological impacts: direct (e.g., acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment); indirect (e.g., threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks); and psychosocial (e.g., chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and postdisaster adjustment). Responses include providing psychological interventions in the wake of acute impacts and reducing the vulnerabilities contributing to their severity; promoting emotional resiliency and empowerment in the context of indirect impacts; and acting at systems and policy levels to address broad psychosocial impacts. The challenge of climate change calls for increased ecological literacy, a widened ethical responsibility, investigations into a range of psychological and social adaptations, and an allocation of resources and training to improve psychologists' competency in addressing climate change-related impacts.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; JUSTICE
AB The purpose of this brief is to highlight the importance of looking at the distributional effects of environmental policies as they are being implemented to achieve their ultimate goal(s). It focuses on recent study that attempts to measure disproportionate effects during the implementation of a policy, rather than looking solely at the effects after the policy has been fully implemented. Much of the evaluative literature on environmental policy tends to focus on effects and impacts after policy implementation. But if we are to fully consider the importance of equity as we think about large-scale policy interventions for issues such as climate change, which carry embedded disproportionate impacts, then we likely need to more fully measure policy impacts at all phases: planning, design, implementation, and evaluation. One way of doing this is by examining disproportionality impacts of discrete environmental policies at a smaller scale. What follows is an overview of recent research into sulfur distributions during the implementation of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (sulfur cap-and-trade program), and linking that work to issues of equity and resilience for climate change policy development.

AB We examine the social burden associated with resilience to environmental shocks in pre-modern societies. We argue that analyses of state-level interventions to mitigate the consequences of catastrophic events tend to isolate these measures from their larger social contexts and thereby overlook the uneven distribution of their burden across different groups. We use three cases of pre-modern societies in the northeastern Mediterranean - the sixth century Roman Empire, the tenth century Byzantine Empire, and the sixteenth century Ottoman Empire. We demonstrate how the adaptive processes that reinforced resilience at the state level incurred different burdens for those at lower levels of the social hierarchy. We found that some groups sustained losses while others gained unexpected benefits in the context of temporary systemic instability. We also found that although elites enjoyed enhanced buffers against the adverse effects in comparison with non-elites, this did not consistently guarantee them a better outcome. We conclude that the differentiated burden of resilience could in some cases entrench existing political or economic configurations, and in other cases, overturn them. Our case studies indirectly address the pressing issue of environmental justice.

AB The environmental movement in South Africa is plural and diverse, but lacks a strong centre or unified framing. How can we explain and understand this, and what consequences does it have for ecological politics in South Africa? There are many environmental grievances, extensive resources available to potential social movements, and a broadly favourable political opportunity structure. On the other hand, prominent environmental organisations have faced a number of limits, obstacles and challenges that have prevented the formation of a strong, unified and popular 'green' movement. Movements on land, housing, and service delivery, however, have thrived in comparison, and, while they tend not to self-identify as environmental movements, they should be regarded as important elements of broader progressive environmental struggles in South Africa. Consumption may also become a powerful framing issue for environmental justice movements, and its relevance to contemporary South Africa is illustrated through a controversial township youth phenomenon known as 'pexing'. While it is important to ensure that South African environmentalism does not become inward-looking and nationalistic, a strong environmental movement is essential for driving a political transformation on to a more environmentally sustainable development path.

ID SECURITY
AB As humanity enters a new era of climate-induced unpredictability, research into the role of religion in shaping perceptions of, and responses to disaster will become increasingly important. This is particularly true of South Asia, which contains dense populations certain to be adversely affected by climate change. This contribution explores the way religion shapes and mediates responses to disaster in Pakistan. Where previous work in this field has focused on extremists and militants, mine considers currents of lived Islam that take explicit stances on questions of natural resource development. Drawing upon extensive primary data, I identify two distinct disaster cosmologies permeating state and society. First, I consider the official Islam of experts and policymakers, whose approach to development is derived from, but arguably surpasses the modernism of British and American colonial and Cold War paradigms in its dogmatic, faith-based belief in the imperative of mastering and exploiting nature. The second is an altogether contrasting formation embedded in a political protest movement representing a marginalized constituency, the Siraiki speaking population of Southern Punjab, which mobilized flood affectees in the aftermath of the 2010 floods around issues of social and environmental justice.

AB Climate change is acknowledged as the largest threat to our societies in the coming decades, potentially affecting large and diverse groups of urban residents in this century of urbanization. As urban areas house highly diverse people with differing vulnerabilities, intensifying climate change is likely to shift the focus of discussions from a general urban perspective to who in cities will be affected by climate change, and how. This brings the urban equity question to the forefront. Here we assess how climate change events may amplify urban inequity. We find that heatwaves, but also flooding, landslides, and even mitigation and adaptation measures, affect specific population groups more than others. As underlying sensitivity factors we consistently identify socioeconomic status and gender. We synthesize the findings with regard to equity types - meaning outcome-based, process-oriented and context-related equity - and suggest solutions for avoiding increased equity and justice concerns as a result of climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation.

AB The growth and development of solar energy, which is so important in the current global context, is determined by political economic factors, and in turn, has varied implications for energy justice. India's western region presents a complex context within which to examine why these trajectories unfold in particular ways and to what end. This article first situates India's renewable energy policy within the dynamics of its federal politics. It then focusses on the trajectory of renewable energy development in two Western Indian states, Rajasthan and Gujarat, highlighting how regional particularities and path dependence have shaped the emergence of solar energy, often in ways that run counter to both expected and hoped for results. The idea of energy justice is subsequently introduced as a way to evaluate whether solar energy infrastructural growth in its present form is best serving the multi-pronged needs of climate justice, economic development, and social equity. By combining a political economy of renewable energy that accounts for the political and institutional factors conditioning the growth of solar capacity with the normative arguments embedded in the energy justice literature, this study contributes to a growing understanding of the intersection of solar power and development.

AB Caribbean islands that are highly dependent on tourism are facing compounding crises from climate-related disasters to the Covid-19 pandemic travel disruption. The rebuilding of tourism infrastructure has often been one of the main aims of international development aid and regional government responses to natural disasters. This article seeks to identify other ways in which Caribbean small island states and non-independent territories might rebuild more sustainable ecologies and economies as they come out of the pandemic within the ongoing climate crisis. The first part shows the historical grounding of climate change vulnerability in colonial histories, neoliberal capitalism and ongoing practices of "extractive" tourism. This analysis of the "coloniality of climate" centers on a critique of disaster tourism during these "unnatural disasters," and allows for re-framing the ethical and political implications of tourism recovery when other human im/mobilities (such as migration) are severely curtailed. The article then elaborates on the theoretical concept of "mobility justice" as a way to think through the problem of sustainability transitions in relation to tourism mobilities, climate change and disaster recovery. The final section considers alternative visions for disaster reconstruction in the Caribbean centering food sovereignty, agroecology and regenerative economies, as promoted by community-based organizations and people's assemblies.

TI The Human Rights Approach to Climate Change: An Overview
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB It is often argued that concerns about the equity of a global climate agreement might appropriately be addressed in the language of human rights. The human rights approach has been promoted by a number of international political actors, including the UN Human Rights Council. As such, human rights are instrumentally applied as a solution to what could be called the "justice problem" in climate negotiations. In order to assess the degree to which human rights could be a useful approach to the justice problem with regard to to climate change, four major issues need to be examined. First, there is the distinction between human rights as protection against climate change versus the right to emit greenhouse gases. Both understandings are found in the debate on climate justice, but they are often not made explicit. Second, the "human rights as protection" approach with a focus on (a) right holders, both presently and in the future, needs to be elucidated, as well as (b) the human rights principles that are at stake, and (c) the duties and duty holders involved. Third, the human right to emit greenhouse gases needs to be clarified in the context of subsistence rights and equal per capita emission rights. Finally, there is the question of whether the cosmopolitan conception of human rights is at odds with the goal of ensuring that individuals assume responsibility for their own carbon-dependent lifestyle.

AB In the era of low-carbon energy transitions, both climate and energy justice studies have raised concerns about the deterioration of energy poverty triggered by carbon mitigation policies. Nevertheless, no in-depth analysis has thus far examined the relationship between people suffering energy poverty and their carbon dioxide emissions. This study addresses the issue by presenting a novel approach to measuring people's basic carbon needs (BCN), which are defined as the amount of carbon emissions needed to achieve (socially and materially) adequate levels of domestic energy services. The results, using Japan as a case study, reveal the differences in people's BCN based on climatic, socio-demographic, and dwelling factors, showing that people in energy poverty need greater carbon emissions to fulfil their basic energy needs than the affluent population. In upcoming lowcarbon energy transitions, people's BCN must be reduced while satisfying their basic energy needs. However, this study shows that the carbon intensity of domestic energy services for energy poverty households is high, leading carbon mitigation policies such as carbon pricing to adversely affect them without suitable countermeasures. Hence, ensuring access to low-carbon energy for all, including the energy poor, is essential to engender an inclusive low-carbon energy transition.

AB The social cost of carbon (SCC) is an estimate of the costs that society will incur because of the emission of one tonne of CO2. Because of the large uncertainties in the effects of climate change and the subjectivity of the discount rate, estimates of SCC range widely, from - 10.2 to 105 213$ t(-1)in 2010 USD. Despite this range, the SCC has been used or proposed as a basis for a wide variety of policymaking including cost-benefit analysis and carbon taxes. The SCC suffers from several practical and philosophical weaknesses: it is anthropocentric, it neglects the acidification of oceans, it assumes that quantifiable economic variables like GDP are the primary costs that humans will experience from climate change, and it is impossible to quantify objectively. Further, the ethical implications of a carbon pricing policy include both the value of the carbon price, and the use of revenues generated by the policy. Thus, revenue neutral carbon policies as in some SCC-based proposals, are unlikely to be just. Here, we propose that the cost of emerging negative-emission technologies would be an alternative means for setting a carbon price and avoid these philosophical and practical weaknesses.

AB Global energy geographies are changing, call it by will or by market forces. As coal production declines or consumption is phased out in parts of the Global North, the future of coal will likely be decided in the Global South. In this article, we explore energyscapes, as multiple and nested sites of connectivity over energy, and their relation to energy justice, environmental conflicts and social movements in new geographies of coal. By putting into question the reproduction of multiple levels of socio-environmental injustices related to coal's extraction and consumption, we trace the emerging South-South coal links with an empirical focus on Colombia and Turkey. Coal extraction and consumption, respectively, in these geographically distant but increasingly connected countries are linked by multiscalar socio-ecological interactions and conflicts. After exploring these interactions, we examine the changing energyscapes of coal operating on different layers (the market, the physical, and the socio-environmental damages) between the two countries. Our analysis reveals that these new geographies are anchored in cross-scalar environmental injustices and democratic deficits, only sustained with top down measures and emerging bilateral dependencies. The coming challenge for energy justice, therefore, is to link local communities' claims and democratization of energyscapes between the supply and the demand sides.

AB In this paper, we argue that a crossover class of climate change solutions (which we term "technological solutions") may disproportionately and adversely impact some populations over others. We begin by situating our discussion in the wider climate discourse, particularly with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Basel Convention. We then suggest that many of the most attractive technological solutions to climate change, such as solar energy and electric car batteries, will likely add to the rapidly growing stream of electronic waste ("e-waste"). This e-waste may have negative downstream effects on otherwise disenfranchised populations. We argue that e-waste burdens women unfairly and disproportionately, affecting their mortality/morbidity and fertility, as well as the development of their children. Building on this, we claim that these injustices are more accurately captured as problems of recognition rather than distribution, since women are often institutionally under-acknowledged both in the workplace and in the home. Without institutional support and representation, women and children are deprived of adequate safety equipment, health precautions, and health insurance. Finally, we return to the question of climate justice in the context of the human right to health and argue for greater inclusion and recognition of women waste workers and other disenfranchised groups in forging future climate agreements.

AB Since launching in the UK in 2018, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has become a global social movement that uses mass civil disobedience to pressure governments to take immediate action on the climate crisis. While XR has shifted the conversation on climate change, it has also been critiqued for its lack of attention to privilege and oppression, and for its 'apolitical' approach to climate organizing. In this article, we argue that XR must develop an intersectional approach in order to address the climate crisis. In particular, we reflect on our experiences as participants in XR-Vancouver, located on unceded Indigenous territory in the settler colonial state of Canada. Settler colonialism in Canada is intertwined with the climate and ecological crises, as Canada's status as a petrostate is built on the dispossession of Indigenous Peoples through a strategy of racial extractivism. To attend to these dynamics, we build on Kyle Powys Whyte's concept of 'decolonizing allyship' and suggest three ethics - of relational accountability, care, and incommensurability - that settler-led movements like XR can cultivate. We conclude by inviting XR to (re)engage with a 'politics of refusal' that subverts the state and allows XR to collectively enact what different systems (rooted in intersectional, decolonizing allyship) could look like.

ID EMISSIONS
AB Expectations play an important role in how people plan their lives and pursue their projects. People living in highly industrialized countries share a way of life that comes with high levels of emissions. Their expectations to be able to continue their projects imply their holding expectations to similarly high future levels of personal emissions. We argue that the frustration or undermining of these expectations would cause them significant harm. Further, the article investigates under what conditions people can be thought to hold legitimate expectations, in particular about permissible levels of future emissions. We distinguish differing theories of understanding these conditions, namely authority-based and justice-based theories, that each allows us to systematically distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate expectations. Furthermore, with respect to individuals' future permissible emissions we give several reasons for holding that such theories cannot identify a particular expectation to a specific level of personal emissions as the only legitimate one. Finally, we argue that the set of legitimate expectations that people hold with respect to a just and effective solution to climate change has normative significance in at least two ways: the differing but equally legitimate expectations ought to be taken into account when justifying what could count as such a solution and when determining the just way of arriving at and implementing such a solution.

ID PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION; PATTERNS
AB The IPCC 1.5 degrees C report argues for a 50% cut of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Dangerous gaps lie between what is required to reach the 1.5 degrees C objective, what governments have pledged and what is happening in reality. Here, we develop 'climate policy gap' graphics for Portugal, Spain and Morocco to help reveal this divide and quantify the under-reaction between diagnosis and action, through layers of political intended and unintended miscommunication, insufficient action and the power of the fossil fuels industries. The climate policy gaps for the three nations reveal overshoots on even the most ambitious levels of emissions reductions pledged when compared with trajectories compatible with 1.5 degrees C or even 2 degrees C limits. This research suggests that there is a built-in feature of under-reaction in climate policy, which staves off any emission pathways compatible with stopping a temperature rise above 1.5 degrees C by 2100. It shows that the climate policy gap is a political and methodological tool that reveals systemic shortcomings of government climate action. Its visibility identifies benchmarks and sectors that should be activated to close these gaps in response to the growing popular demands for climate justice.

TI CHALLENGES OF COMPENSATION AND REPARATION FOR LOSS AND DAMAGE RELATED TO
   THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
SO MEXICAN LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Loss and damage; reparation; compensation; attribution; causal nexus;
   Human Rights
AB Anthropogenic climate change has and will have unavoidable adverse effects despite mitigation and adaptation policies. Therefore, the financial burden of the costs of loss and damage must be distributed fairly and proportionally. This implies that those responsible for climate change must take responsibility and compensate those who suffer losses and, if possible, repair the damages related to this phenomenon. However, climate justice has been limited by the lack of a causal link between a specific climate change effect and specific damages or losses. Accordingly, this article discusses the compensation and reparation of losses and damages related to the adverse effects of climate change, as a stream applicable after mitigation and adaptation policies. In addition, this article reviews the implications of the relevant findings that established the existence and development of climate change as a problem that affects the enjoyment of human rights, to argue how the theory of human rights can contribute to the current legal model for reparation and compensation for losses and damages associated with climate change. Also, due to the impossibility of obtaining a legally binding agreement as a structure for integration, and to adequately address the problem of causes, consequences, benefits and burdens, vulnerable groups ought to be the most affected.

AB Between 2010 and 2017, the New Zealand Government undertook a range of subtle yet disturbing tactics to create a legislative environment that enabled deep sea oil exploration. This included forms of public endorsement, policy documents and legislative change that prioritised further oil development in the country to create a certain common-sense around increased fossil fuel extraction. In response, a range of communities and autonomous Oil Free groups have emerged to contest both the legislative changes and this underlying common-sense. We draw on this example to respond to calls within geography and political science literature to situate analysis of contemporary politics in empirical contexts. We use Ranciere's thought combined with the frames of politicisation, depoliticisation and repoliticisation to explore the entangled nature of government and oil industry actions, and community climate change activism. We argue that while there were clearly attempts by government and the oil industry to close down spaces of dissent and limit debate around fossil fuel development to technocratic questions of health and safety, the effects of attempts at closure are paradoxical. Such attempts at closure are always incomplete and at times, mobilise people to contestatory action. We show how activists have strategically drawn on certain discourses to exert claims of, and for, equality in public debates around the pressing issue of climate change.

TI Wrong Side of the Tracks: The Neglected Human Costs of Transporting Oil

SO HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The connection between human rights and climate change is most evident when examining carbon dioxide emissions that result from burning fossil fuels (e.g., sea level rise and displaced coastal cultures). However, the transport of fossil fuels also has human rights implications for human rights and climate change. This research focuses on the health and safety risks inflicted on those residents who are adjacent to the railways that ship fossil fuels along the US-Canada transportation corridors. Applying sociological and jurisprudential perspectives, we review the environmental/climate justice literature as it pertains to industrial transport corridors, documenting the forms of heightened risk imposed on those living along these transportation paths. Next, we develop an illustrative case study of Canada's worst rail catastrophe. In so doing, we provide evidence of a decades-long failure of US and Canadian regulators to prevent such disasters. We interpret that disaster through a human rights case law suggesting that States have an affirmative duty to protect their citizens from foreseeable disasters. Based on this analysis, we propose specific rail safety regulatory reforms. We argue that if the US and Canadian governments implement these regulations as required under human rights law, they can more effectively honor their obligations to their citizens who are paying a high human cost for the material benefits associated with increased energy production.

AB As resilience strategies become a prominent orthodoxy in city planning, green infrastructure is increasingly deployed to enhance protection from climate risks and impacts. Yet, little is known about the social and racial impacts of such interventions citywide. In response, our study uses a quantitative and spatial analytical approach to assess whether interventions we call "green resilient infrastructure" (GRI) protect social groups traditionally most at risk and/or least able to adapt to climate impacts - or conversely, if the aggregate effect is maladaptive and inequitable outcomes (i.e. shifting vulnerability or climate gentrification). First, we performed a pre-post test of GRI siting distribution relative to socio-ecological vulnerability in Philadelphia neighborhoods. Second, we examined gentrification trends in relation to GRI siting and whether these interventions contribute to increasing the socio-ecological vulnerability of historically marginalized populations. Our findings point to a strong negative association between GRI siting and increased minority population, and a strong positive association between GRI siting, gentrification, and reduced minority population. The paper contributes to a better understanding of siting inequities and urban climate injustice dynamics and offers a new conceptual frame for critical urban adaptation research and practice of the pathways that shape uneven and unjust outcomes.

ID RIGHTS; LAW
AB Storm surges, flooding, heatwaves, and prolonged drought, as ever more regular features of life under deteriorating climate conditions, are unmistakably violent. Their effects on the lives of vulnerable human populations and ecosystems across the world are widely known to be devastating. Yet a legal order that denies the victims of such ecological persecution safe haven, no matter how great its use of force (e.g., detention, arrest, forced return) cannot, by definition, be violent. The power of law, used to protect states' rights to exclude from their jurisdictions growing numbers displaced involuntarily by global climate harms, in being a source of legitimate right', is never the same as violence. This article challenges the ongoing validity of this assumption. It points to some of the ways in which legal instruments are used today to deny those displaced by climatic conditions sufficient normative status to guarantee their safety. What is needed instead is a new critical normative understanding of the evolving relationship between climate change, violence, justice, and law, one that re-assesses the democratic justificatory grounds for the current positions of non-responsibility for the climate displaced whilst re-affirming such people's legal and political status as equal co-members of the politically constituted international community of humanity.

AB This introduction to the special issue lays out the key themes and arguments across the five research papers and Viewpoint. Foremost, we highlight how by bringing this research across diverse Asian cities together into one special issue, the work reveals how water is foundational to the city. To illuminate how our work on water urbanisms in Asia has the potential to 'rethink the way in which cities operate' (Xiao, 2016, 3367), this special issue examines the central paradigms of 'water and the city' by emphasising the 'water work' of multiple actors, to identify possibilities and opportunities, in addition to 'governance failures' in the production of the urban form (Bakker et al., 2008). In particular, these papers provide compelling evidence that to comprehend fully the future of Asian cities in the Anthropocene, it is necessary to understand their related topographies, their water systems and, also, their practices and politics of water distribution. These contributions are thus well positioned to contribute to engaged debates in geography and planning on development, water and the 'urban condition' as linked to environmental change and social justice, through a range of disciplinary approaches.

ID SOCIAL-JUSTICE; ENGLAND; WORKFORCE; PROGRESS
AB In this conceptual article, the authors examine the context of early childhood education and care in England and the underpinning predominant ideologies to explore how these impact on the framing of leadership. The English context entails several contradictions (antinomies) at ontological, epistemological and axiological levels, and is heavily influenced by an ideological struggle concerning the value of play within the sector as opposed to a climate of child performativity. Moreover, the predominately female workforce (a factor itself) has faced relentless changes in terms of qualifications and curriculum reforms in recent years. With the introduction of the graduate leader qualification (Early Years Teacher Status), a vast body of research has been seeking to conceptualise what leadership means for early childhood education and care. In this article, the authors argue that these attempts are helpful and contribute to this discourse of leadership, but it needs to be thought of not only abstractly, but also practically. Thus, the authors conclude, the (re)conceptualisation of leadership should locate it as pedagogical praxis after evaluating the inherent deep dispositions of leaders in conjunction with their history, surrounding culture and subjective perspectives/realities.

AB At the Second Pacific Climate Change conference in Wellington in February 2018, New Zealand's Minister for Pacific Peoples, 'Aupito Tofae Su'a William Sio, said New Zealand must have policies in place to deal with the possibility of climate-induced migration from the Pacific Islands. He described having such a policy in place as being akin to a factory preparing an evacuation plan in case of an earthquake: A vital precaution for something everybody hoped would never be needed. But what would that policy look like, how far forward would planners have to think, what issues are involved and who would be responsible for making sure it was effective? This article examines four key areas of concern that will have to be dealt with if an effective policy on climate change-induced migration is to be developed: Public perceptions, the law, maintaining Island culture and identity and changing the existing media narrative on social change. It identifies three groups of key players in the process: Legislators and legal experts, churches, and journalists.

DT Article

ID GENDER; WORK
AB As we enter what has been defined as a climate emergency, governments are formulating policy responses that address sustainability through low carbon transitions. This article examines the relationship between policy representation in climate mitigation, business and food policies, and the implementation of sustainable practices in professional kitchens. The restaurant industry is a major consumer of natural resources as many practices throughout the supply chain are carbon intensive. Following Carol Bacchi's "What is the problem represented to be?" framework, this article examines the extent to which policy representation of sustainability and food governance influences everyday practices in professional kitchens in Glasgow, Scotland, based on research undertaken in 2019. This study revealed that climate change, business and food policies promote the idea that sustainability will be achieved alongside economic growth, without considering the complexities of social inequalities. The policies significantly overlook the private sector responsibility to transform away from unsustainable practices, whilst the potential approaches to improve social and environmental sustainability are obscured. The article concludes by calling for policies to integrate issues of social justice in the representation of the problem to produce more transformative and socially equitable outcomes.

AB Sustainability transitions tend to be seen as technical, not social, affairs. Mainstream scholars and practitioners do not very often acknowledge environmental and social justice in their transitions work. They seldom recognize rights for racially marginalized people, or the possible existence of rights of Earth. Nor do they query whether they are exaggerating the reach of scientific and technological solutions. By contrast, some recent ecological science fiction writing has begun to place these issues at the center of transitions. In the Broken Earth series, N.K. Jemisin explores Earth through the lens of racial and ecological injustice. She interrogates four themes relevant to transitions. How should we live in a climate-changed world? What role does racial and social subordination play in destroying the environment? What are the dangers of hubris in seeking out a fundamental change through science and technology that cannot be readily controlled after all? How should we think about Earth itself? I conclude with some thoughts on how Earth could be made 'unbroken' again through integrating recognition, humility, renewal, and redistribution into transitions.

SO PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID WEATHER; EXPERIENCE; CARBON; IMPACT; RISK
AB Few, if any, political scientists currently study climate change adaptation or are even aware that there is a large and growing interdisciplinary field of study devoted not just to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions but to reducing our vulnerability to the now-inevitable impacts of climate change. The lack of political science expertise and research represents an obstacle for adapting to climate change, because adaptation is fundamentally political. Technical advances in adaptations for infrastructure, agriculture, public health, coastal protection, conservation, and other fields all depend on political variables for their implementation and effectiveness. For example, adaptation raises questions about political economy (adaptation costs money), political theory (adaptation involves questions of social justice), comparative politics (some countries more aggressively pursue adaptation), urban politics (some cities more aggressively pursue adaptation), regime type (democracies and authoritarian regimes may differently pursue adaptation), federalism (different levels of government may be involved), and several other fields of study including political conflict, international development, bureaucracy, migration, media, political parties, elections, civil society, and public opinion. I review the field of climate change adaptation and then explore the tremendous contributions that political scientists could make to adaptation research.

ID POLICY
AB This is a case study of the Camp for Climate Action, which has held several high-profile protest events in the UK since its inception in 2006. It analyses the Camp as a contested space where different emphases on environmental and social priorities have to be negotiated by its activists. The article considers areas of contestation where concerns over climate change meet questions of social justice. These are structured around tangible issues of campaigning, such as opposition to new coal-fired power stations or to the third runway at Heathrow airport, some of which have put the Camp at odds with labour movement and class struggle activists. While some demand a drastic shift away from current levels of consumption, others question the discriminatory effects of self-imposed austerity politics. On a more abstract level, the article considers debates on the need for government solutions to the environmental crisis and their possible impacts on social equality. The article is structured around movement-internal debates and makes use of interviews, extensive fieldwork notes and continuous participant observation over the course of four years.

AB Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention using theater and dialogue to raise awareness about homophobia and transphobia and increase intentions to participate in macro-level change efforts around lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) issues. Methods: Using a pretest-posttest design, this study examines changes in advocacy intentions around LGBTQQ issues among middle school and high school students who participated in the intervention (n = 515). Results: Students reported a significant increase in intentions to advocate. Existing intervention behaviors and increased recognition of homophobia/transphobia as problems were associated with greater increases in intention to advocate. Respondents with higher existing intervention behaviors, as well as White students and cisgender women, reported higher advocacy intentions compared to students of color and cisgender men. Further, we found indication of greater awareness of homophobia/transphobia as a problem in school. Conclusions: Youth-led theater and dialogue-based interventions may be a promising strategy for addressing heterosexism and genderism in schools.

AB Anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of the physical threats to human and planetary wellbeing. However, climate change risks, and their interaction with other "riskscapes", remain understudied. Riskscapes encompass different viewpoints on the threat of loss across space, time, individuals and collectives. This Special Issue of the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy, and Society enhances our understanding of the multifaceted and interlocking dimensions of climate change and riskscapes. It brings together rigorous and critical international scholarship across diverse realms on inquiry under two, interlinked, themes: (i) governance and institutional responses and (ii) vulnerabilities and inequalities. The contributors offer a forceful reminder that when considering climate change, social justice principles cannot be appended after the fact. Climate change adaptation and mitigation pose complex and interdependent social and ethical dilemmas that will need to be explicitly confronted in any activation of "Green New Deal" strategies currently being developed internationally. Such critical insights about the layered, unequal and institutional dimensions of risks are of paramount import when considering other riskscapes pertaining to conflict and war, displaced people and pandemics like the 2019-2020 global COVID-19 pandemic.

AB The imperatives of environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and social justice (partially codified in the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs) call for ambitious societal transformations. As such, few aspects of actionable knowledge for sustainability are more crucial than those concerning the processes of transformation. This article offers a brief overview of different conceptualisations of transformation, and outlines a set of practical principles for effective research and action towards sustainability. We review three approaches to transformations, labelled: 'structural', 'systemic' and 'enabling'. We show how different ways of understanding what we mean by transformations can affect what actions follow. But these approaches are not mutually exclusive. We use an international set of examples on low carbon economy transformations, seed systems, wetland conservation and peri-urban development to show how they can be complementary and reinforcing. We describe three cross-cutting practical considerations that must be taken seriously for effective transformations to sustainability: diverse knowledges, plural pathways and the essentially political nature of transformation. Realizing the ambitions of the SDGs, we conclude, requires being clear about what we mean by transformation, and recognizing these basic methodological principles for action.

AB Similar to many criminologists, my interest in pursuing this career was driven by a desire to improve responses to injustices, on both small and large scales. I believe that among criminologists, this dedication to effect changes in social and legal justice disproportionately drives those of us historically kept out of the academy due to our race, gender, class, sexual identity, and/or other marginalizations. Fortunately, there is a growing diversity among criminologists and this has had a powerful impact on expanding the scope and depth of the field. At the same time, I am concerned that academic training and university climates frequently work against our commitment to advancing social and legal justice changes, what I refer to as criminology activism. This address is a call to action, stressing criminologists' responsibility to advocate for social and legal justice on small and large scales. Numerous types of criminology activism are identified (e.g., in research, service, and teaching), including the requisite to continue diversifying the representation of criminologists.

AB This research focuses on youth social entrepreneurs who are leading ventures that address pressing societal problems including climate change, gun reform, and social justice. It answers Journal of Public Policy & Marketing's call for more research in marketing on social entrepreneurship. Consistent with the mission of Transformative Consumer Research to enhance individual and societal well-being, this research explores how the dynamic ecosystem of youth social entrepreneurs empowers them to rise up to transform people, communities, and the future for the better. The authors partnered with 20 established youth social entrepreneurs who have founded social impact initiatives as well as two organizations that support youth social entrepreneurs, Ashoka and Future Coalition, to develop a framework for understanding the ecosystem that encourages youth social entrepreneurs to enhance people's well-being and make the world a better place. This framework integrates the experiences of these youth social entrepreneur partners and extant literature in marketing and related disciplines to provide guidance that can help researchers, policy makers, educators, and parents design an environment to support the success of youth social entrepreneurs.

AB Plastic waste disposal practices and subsequent leakage into the environment are creating environmental, economic, and social problems. Reduction of plastic waste generation is one of the main solutions offered to remedy the plastic waste problem. However, it is undeniable that plastics play a significant role in benefiting humanity. Plastic medical devices save lives, household equipment and vehicle components are lighter and more fuel efficient. Conventional plastics are produced from virgin fossil feedstocks (oil and natural gas), and their carbon footprint is contributing to the problem of climate change. However, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories generally report that emissions related to global waste management may not be as high as other GHG sources, i.e. electricity generation from fossil fuel combustion or transportation, concluding that innovative approaches in the waste management sector may not substantially contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. This paper examines near or long term technical and policy changes needed that can support environmental health, mitigate climate change, and promote social justice by feeding plastic waste back into the circular carbon economy.

AB Climate adaptation has become a pressing issue. Yet little attention has been paid to the consequences of adaptation policies and practices for sustainability. Recognition that not every adaptation to climate change is a good one has drawn attention to the need for sustainable adaptation strategies and measures that contribute to social justice and environmental integrity. This article presents four normative principles to guide responses to climate change and illustrates the significance of the 'sustainable adaptation' concept through case studies from diverse contexts. The principles are: first, recognize the context for vulnerability, including multiple stressors; second, acknowledge that differing values and interests affect adaptation outcomes; third, integrate local knowledge into adaptation responses; and fourth, consider potential feedbacks between local and global processes. We argue that fundamental societal transformations are required in order to achieve sustainable development pathways and avoid adaptation funding going into efforts that exacerbate vulnerability and contribute to rising emissions. Despite numerous challenges involved in achieving such change, we suggest that sustainable adaptation practices have the potential to address some of the shortcomings of conventional social and economic development pathways.

ID SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; POVERTY
AB With reference to agrarian environments in southern India, this article argues that insights from political ecology provide an important way to move forward on debates on human security and climate change adaptation. While current human security perspectives helpfully situate the pursuit of climate change adaption within questions of social justice, they have been less forthcoming in providing suitable analytical tools to conceptualize the relationship between power, inequality and vulnerability. To address this gap, insights from political ecology are used to specify the relational dynamics of vulnerability, i.e. the ways in which marginalized peoples are adversely incorporated into political, social and economic relationships that produce their vulnerability while simultaneously creating relative security for others. This perspective is elaborated with examples from Andhra Pradesh, India, where differential control over key productive assets including land, water, labour and credit is key to the hierarchical displacement of security/insecurity across the agrarian population. By foregrounding the relational dynamics of vulnerability, this article provides analytical tools that offer a fuller account of the possibilities and limits to public policy aimed at sustainable climate change adaptation.

AB At a time of great urgency for transitions to sustainability in light of climate mitigation targets, energy infrastructure is in a state of flux. Expansions in renewable energy and the persistent grasp of fossil fuels over a historically centralised sector surface new challenges of socio-spatial and environmental justice. Where does new energy infrastructure appear, how is this decided, who benefits and who is burdened? What land uses are displaced and with what socio-ecological implications? This collection pulls together insights from environmental and land governance, ethnographic studies of situated social identities, and emerging conceptualisations of energy infrastructure to address these concerns. It features contributions focused at multiple scales - the urban, regional, national and trans-local - and informed by a variety of cognate conceptual lenses: political ecology, human geography, social anthropology, urban studies, socio-technical transitions and epistemic politics. Examining cases from three continents, both the Global South and North, the theme issue presents an array of perspectives from established and emerging scholars. It seeks to combine empirically rich and theoretically rigorous enquiry at the conjuncture of energy infrastructure transitions, changing land use and morphing social identity. The aim is thus to further interdisciplinary knowledge on socio-ecological implications of cross-sectoral transitions.

AB Flood risk reduction is an existent discourse and agenda in policy and insurance. Existing approaches such as linking hydrological models to economic loss models may be highly inequitable between areas of different socio-economic vulnerability. To our knowledge, no one has tried to adapt the more advanced known heat risk theory by first informing flood risk with the socio-economic vulnerability, and then investigating the sensitivity of risk reduction policies to that flood risk. In this article, we demonstrate two methods to combine water hazard data with a derived water vulnerability index to characterize water risk. We then compare the costs of two potential government policies: buyout of the home versus funding for foundation elevation. We use the case study area of Pittsburgh, PA, which faces severe precipitation and riverine flooding hazards. We find that while small differences in characterizing flood risk can result in large differences between flood risk maps, the cost of the flood risk reduction policy is not sensitive to the method of representing the socio-economic vulnerability. This suggests that while validation of flood risk incorporating socioeconomic data is needed, for some policies, policymakers can prioritize environmental justice with little to no additional cost.

AB Cities around the world are increasingly developing plans to adapt to the consequences of climate change. These plans will have important consequences for urban populations because they are likely to reshape and reconfigure urban infrastructures, services, and decision making processes. It is critical that these adaptation plans are developed in a way that is just. Criteria was developed that can be used to assess justice in adaptation so that the processes, priorities, and impacts address the needs of the most vulnerable urban populations. Further, mechanisms are outlined that have been proposed as responsible for producing urban injustice. The justice criteria are applied to the case of adaptation planning in Delhi and the extent to which poor and informal populations are included and affected by this planning. The analysis shows that adaptation planning in Delhi does not meet the justice criteria in part because of a lack of capacity and the political economy of poverty in the city. The criteria for justice and mechanisms of injustice offer an important step toward developing a greater understanding of not only whether city-level adaptation planning is just, but also why it is or is not.

AB The growing interest in urban areas as sites for climate action has led to new ways of conceiving and planning the urban. As climate actions reshape existing understandings of what cities are or ought to be, they constitute new modalities of what recent scholarship has referred to as 'climate urbanism'. This research has framed climate urbanism as a climate-inflected iteration of neoliberal urban development, geared towards the mobilization of 'green' private capital for large-scale infrastructural projects, focused on carbon metrics, and conducive to population displacement through eco-gentrification. In this intervention, we commend these efforts to deliver a critical perspective on how climate change gives rise to forms of urbanism that reproduce urban injustices without addressing the root causes of the climate crisis. However, we warn against two biases in recent scholarship, namely an emphasis on technological solutions and an overreliance on familiar contexts of climate action. The literature on climate urbanism does not yet reflect the diversity of urban responses emerging under the broad umbrella of urban climate action. Adopting a post-colonial perspective on climate urbanism, we call for a greater engagement with the heterogeneous character of climate-changed urban futures.

AB The abrupt climate change thesis suggests that climate passes through threshold transitions, after which change is sudden, runaway and un-stoppable. This concurs with recent themes in complexity studies. Data from ice cores indicates that major shifts in global climate regimes have occurred in as little as a decade, and that for most of the span of human existence the climate has oscillated much more violently than it has over the last 10,000 years. This evidence presents enormous challenges for international climate change negotiation and regulation, which has thus far focused on gradual change. It is argued that existing social theoretic engagements with physical agency are insufficiently geared towards dissonant or disastrous physical events. Wagering on the past and future importance of abrupt climate change, the article explores a way of engaging with catastrophic climatic change that stresses the inherent volatility and unpredictability of earth process, and the no-less-inherent vulnerability of the human body. Drawing on Bataille and Derrida, it proposes a way of nestling the issue of environmental justice within a broader sense of immeasurable indebtedness to those humans who endured previous episodes of abrupt climate change, and considers the idea of experimentation and generosity without reserve.

AB Given the existing inequities in climate change, any proposed climate engineering strategy to solve the climate problem must meet a high threshold for justice. In contrast to an overly thin paradigm for justice that demands only a science-based assessment of potential temperature-related benefits and harms, we argue for the importance of attention to recognitional justice. Recognitional justice, we go on to claim, calls for a different type of assessment tool. Such an assessment would pay attention to neglected considerations such as relationships, context, power, vulnerability, narrative, and affect (amongst others). Here we develop a care-ethics related tool for assessing the justice (or injustice) of climate engineering with stratospheric aerosols, and suggest that qualitative social science methods may be required for its effective application. We illustrate the use of this tool with a case study involving interviews about stratospheric aerosol injection conducted in Kenya, the Solomon Islands, and the North American Arctic. Having shown through this case study the efficacy of the care approach for spotting recognitional injustice, we suggest that a care approach is not only sensitive to the considerations that count, it can also be powerfully normative.

LA English
DT Article
AB As global supplies diminish and climate change threatens future supplies even more, water as a human right has received increasing attention among human rights scholars and in international commissions and agreements. In this article, the author argues that the right to water should he recognized as a basic right in and of itself, not merely as a component of the right to development or to a healthy life. The right to water, described both substantively and procedurally, is an "emergent" right that uniquely connects present and future generations into a relationship of justice involving reciprocity. As such, the human right to water needs to be not only a part of international politics and law, but must also percolate down to the local level in specific policy decisions regarding land use, zoning, and development. It is time for human rights to return to those "small places, close to home" where Eleanor Roosevelt famously claimed that they invariably originate. A primary example is the local regulation of golf courses, especially in light of their profligate water usage. A golf course's impact on neighboring communities and, by implication, on a global water system is, therefore, a legitimate focus of human rights litigation and advocacy.

AB The Sao Paulo Macro Metropolis (SPMM) is one of the richest and most inequitable regions of the Global South and is already experiencing the impacts of severe climate events. This study analyzes climate risk assessments and policy responses for this territory as well as its vulnerabilities. The Index of Vulnerability to Natural Disasters related to Droughts in the Context of Climate Change (IVDNS-acronym in Portuguese) was used to identify and select the most vulnerable municipalities in the SPMM. Following vulnerability analysis, the municipalities were subjected to risk analysis in the context of existing Brazilian legislation. The results indicate that, despite having positive capacities to respond to climate change, the analyzed municipalities are far from advancing from the status quo or taking the actions that are necessary to face future challenges in a climate emergency scenario. The results indicate that, despite being the most vulnerable to droughts and natural disasters, the cities analyzed are not the most vulnerable in the Sao Paulo Macro Metropolis from a socio-economic point of view. On the contrary, these are regions that could have a strong institutional capacity to respond to present and future challenges.

AB Green Infrastructure (GI) is defined as a network of natural and semi-natural areas that is strategically designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and to enhance human wellbeing. In Europe, the GI concept has been strongly related to the concepts of multifunctionality, climate change, and green growth, particularly in the last decade, leading to a research and policy agenda that varies greatly, targeting different audiences and topics. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of the key characteristics of GI research by focusing on the countries of the European Union. We consider the conceptualizations of GI, key research priorities, and thematic clusters within the existing literature. We demonstrate that the ambiguous definition of GI has generated a high diversity in research objectives and outputs. We also show that urban green spaces and ecosystems services are the most frequent topics and that more research is needed on the social aspects of GI. We suggest that an explicit incorporation of both nature conservation and social-environmental justice goals is essential for GI research to support sustainability transitions within and beyond the city.

AB This paper makes the case that justice scholarship cannot adequately account for the rural grievances that helped launch Trump to the presidency. This relative blind spot in the literature offers an opportunity for rural sociologists and rural studies scholars more generally to elevate their relevance in the academy and beyond. From late-2012 to late-2017, I traversed the state of Colorado interviewing and participating alongside non metro residents from its 24 "rural" and 23 "frontier" counties-the latter designation refers to those counties with a population density of six or fewer persons per square mile (the state has 64 counties in total). The argument is informed by 129 face-to-face interviews with residents from across these 47 counties. An additional 144 participant observation-related conversations help further inform the argument. After explaining why rural grievances driving much of today's populism remains a problem for justice scholarship, I document injustices experienced among those interviewed, categorizing them along the three axes of distribution, recognition, and representation. I then offer tentative suggestions for building recognition and empathy between metro and non metro Coloradans. The paper concludes discussing its limitations and the next steps for future scholarship.

AB This paper proposes an approach to capturing and reviewing scientific literature addressing latent topics across multiple scientific fields. As latent topics like moral values are affected by word polysemy and synonymy, a traditional keyword-based approach is often ineffective and therefore inappropriate. As a result, scientific literature addressing latent topics tends to be fragmented thereby constraining efforts to address similar and complementary research challenges. A novel approach to reviewing the literature by utilizing both semantic fields and probabilistic topic models has therefore been developed. We illustrate this approach by reviewing the literature addressing the value justice in the energy sector and compare this with a regular keyword-based approach. The new approach results in a more complete overview of the relevance of energy justice as compared to the traditional keyword-based approach. This novel approach can be applied to other latent topics including other values or phenomena such as societal resistance to technologies, thereby leading to an increased understanding of existing relevant literature and the identification of new areas of research.

AB Urban heat stress poses a major risk to public health. Case studies of individual cities suggest that heat exposure, like other environmental stressors, may be unequally distributed across income groups. There is little evidence, however, as to whether such disparities are pervasive. We combine surface urban heat island (SUHI) data, a proxy for isolating the urban contribution to additional heat exposure in built environments, with census tract-level demographic data to answer these questions for summer days, when heat exposure is likely to be at a maximum. We find that the average person of color lives in a census tract with higher SUHI intensity than non-Hispanic whites in all but 6 of the 175 largest urbanized areas in the continental United States. A similar pattern emerges for people living in households below the poverty line relative to those at more than two times the poverty line. Individual exposure to heat is associated with adverse health and economic outcomes. Here, the authors show that people of color and people living in poverty bear a disproportionate burden of urban heat exposure in almost all major cities in the continental United States.

AB As the impacts of climate change intensify, potential relocation is becoming more of a reality for coastal communities throughout the world. This is furthering the demand for the implementation of governance relocation frameworks. In order to stay true to the principles of environmental justice while at the same time ensuring an effective policy that meets the needs and wants of affected communities, an adaptive relocation framework requires collaboration between state and non-state actors. It is thus important to pay attention to how non-state actors are incorporated into public participatory climate change adaptation efforts. In order to affectively address previous limitations of public participation, stakeholders must pay attention to already existing power systems. Through a case study approach of a village relocation project in Fiji, I examine the role of power in a climate change adaptation plan that involved the community of Vunidogoloa, local government, and national government stakeholders. I employ Steven Lukes's three-dimensional framework of power to the case of Vunidogoloa, a Fijian village that relocated inland due to coastal erosion and shoreline flooding, to illustrate how the political arrangement of participation reinforced existing hierarchies between the village and the government.

AB Anthropogenic climate change will disproportionately affect equatorial regions and closely adjacent areas, referred to here as the Fateful Ellipse. The vulnerability of these regions is exacerbated by a lack of capital for adaptive measures against the impacts of climate change. The increasing transference of capital from governmental control to private hands, and the increasing concentration of such capital into the hands of fewer individuals raises further concerns about capacity to mitigate or adapt to climate change. In addition, conflicts arise regarding the choice of climate change solutions. Ironically, the people of the Fateful Ellipse, who are most vulnerable to climate change, produce the lowest amount of carbon per capita. As a result of the colonial enterprise, including slavery, they also paid a heavy price toward the economic ascendency of Europe and North America and the Industrial Revolution that fueled the rise in greenhouse gas production. The discipline of geography itself owes some measure of its development and ascendency to colonialism and the exploitation of the Fateful Ellipse. As geographers we have the capacity, and a special responsibility, to contribute to the development of climate change solutions and global environmental justice.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH
AB Veganism is a way of living that is growing in popularity in the West. It is a social movement that seeks to avoid and raise awareness about the exploitation of, and cruelty towards, animals for human purposes and consumption practices. This paper provides a critical reflection on my experience of being vegan, that has raised some ethical questions for me about some of the unintended implications of veganism. This critically reflective process has empowered me to research my implicit assumptions surrounding veganism, and their connection to dominant discourses that serve to shape unequal power distributions within society. Specifically, this paper examines how veganism as a movement has become increasingly concerned with promoting environmental justice due to its intersection with animal rights, which may have unintended related colonising implications in which Indigenous people's rights are further oppressed. It highlights how veganism, particularly within the West, is interlocked with privilege and cultural capital. The intersections between food sovereignty and Indigenous rights are also discussed. An example of the ways this research can help shift the discussion around de-colonising the vegan movement is given in relation to the implications for social work practice; particularly the field of Green social work.

AB Harmful environmental consequences of growth have been rigorously documented and widely publicized throughout the past half- century. Yet, the quantity of matter and energy used by human economies continues to increase by the minute, while governments and businesses continue to promise and to prioritize further economic growth. Such a paradox raises questions about how we humans change course. This introduction to a Special Section offers a new theoretical approach to change, together with glimpses of adaptations underway around the world. It directs attention away from individual decision-making and toward systems of culture and power through which socialized humans and socioecological worlds are (re) produced, sustained and adapted. Potential for transformative change is found in habitual practices through which skills, perspectives, denials and desires are viscerally embodied, and in cultural systems (economic, religious, gender and other) that govern those practices and make them meaningful. Case studies reviewed illuminate diverse communities acting to maintain old and to forge new moral and material worlds that prioritize wellbeing, equity and sustainability rather than expansion. This article endeavors to galvanize change by conceptualizing degrowth, by decolonizing worldviews of expansionist myths and values, and by encouraging connections between science and activism, north and south.

TI Four Sustainability Goals in a Swedish Low-Growth/Degrowth Context

ID UNEQUAL EXCHANGE; LAND-USE; SAFE; PERSPECTIVE; SPACE
AB Continual environmental degradation and an unfair distribution of environmental burdens and benefits are two great challenges for humanity. Economic growth is often taken for granted when planning for the future. However, it is often argued that maintaining economic growth conflicts with keeping human activities adjusted to ecological boundaries and finite resources, at least for the more-developed countries. With this paper, we present sustainability goals for building and planning in Sweden to be achieved by 2050 in a context of limited or even negative economic growth. These goals should ensure that all groups in society have sufficient resources and a good life within planetary boundaries. We select four goals in a participatory process: two environmental goals related to climate change and land use and two social goals related to welfare and participation. Our results show that achieving the environmental goals will require significant reductions of Sweden's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use compared to today's levels. Regarding the social goals, these are, in many aspects, reasonably well fulfilled in Sweden today, although disparities remain between groups of citizens. The main challenge, however, is to ensure that these goals are fulfilled even within environmental limits and if economic growth should halt.

AB How will archaeology contribute to agricultural sustainability? To address that question, this overview reflects on the diverse and complementary ways that archaeology has advanced our understanding of sustainable agriculture. Here, I assess recent archaeological research through the lens of the five principles of sustainable agriculture used by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. These principles-efficiency, conservation, rural livelihoods, resilience, and governance-highlight the social and environmental dimensions of agricultural sustainability. By drawing on case studies from around the world, I show how archaeology is uniquely situated to examine the interactions of these social and environmental dimensions over long periods of time. Archaeology's strongest conceptual contributions to sustainable agriculture are (1) its capacity to demonstrate that sustainability is historically contingent and (2) its attention to outcomes. If transformed into meaningful action, these contributions have the potential to advance modern agricultural sustainability and environmental justice initiatives. This overview is an invitation to clarify a plan for future research and outreach. It is an invitation to imagine what an archaeology for sustainable agriculture will look like and what it will accomplish.

AB The scientific literature distinguishes between primary or natural and secondary or human-induced salinization. Assessing this distinction is of vital importance to assign liabilities and responsibilities in pollution cases and for designing the best policy and management actions. In this context, actors interested in downplaying the role of certain drivers of human-induced salinization can attempt to neglect its importance by referring to natural salinization, in a similar fashion to other pollution and health-related cases, fromtobacco smoke to climate change. Potash mining, which has experienced continued growth during the last decades and is a significant contributor to salinization, is prone to originate such controversies because natural salinization from the saline geological catch can be mixed with salinization produced by mining waste such as brines and mine tailings, thus obscuring the distinction between causes. By reviewing the long-standing social and environmental conflict caused by potash mining in a region of Mediterranean climate-the Llobregat river basin-in this article, we highlight the importance of the impacts of salinization on human health and provide a critical social science perspective on salinization processes.

TI Siting Renewable Energy: Land Use and Regulatory Context
SO ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
AB This Article takes up the increasingly important land use question of siting for renewable energy. As concern over climate change grows, new policies are being crafted at all levels of government to support renewable energy as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These policies are driving the need to site and construct new power plants that will utilize renewable resources. Historically, power plant siting has been the province of state and local governments, so the regulatory context into which renewables are being integrated varies, sometimes significantly, jurisdiction by jurisdiction.
   To examine this regulatory context, this Article focuses on Florida, a state which consumes the third-most electricity in the United States but Which generates less than 2 percent of that electricity from renewable resources. The Article first provides an overview of Florida's power supply sector and sets out the existing regulatory context for terrestrial siting of energy facilities. It then situates Florida's most promising renewable resources within that context, identifies regulatory barriers that implicate siting, and considers the siting issues unique to each resource. As the article explains, we now have a window of opportunity in which state and local governments can plan for and guide renewable energy siting an approach that contrasts with utility-driven planning and siting that has long been standard practice.

TI Like Oil and Water in the American West: Water Market Access amid
   Unconventional Oil Production in Colorado
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GAS; POPULATION; TRANSFERS; IMPACTS; BECAME; POLICY
AB Characterized as a "wicked" problem, water shortage in the American West will soon become a reality-due to increasing population, climate change, and decreased flows. Concurrently, water-centered technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling have facilitated the rapid and widespread growth of unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production in the United States. Water markets are increasingly touted as the best, most efficient, and fairest mechanisms for allocating vital and scarce resources. Yet this contention is largely unexplored at the food-energy-water nexus, particularly from an environmental justice perspective-where equitable water access for all users is a central concern. We utilize a case study in Colorado's South Platte basin based on 41 in-depth interviews to show: (1) distortions created in regional water markets as wealthy UOG operators participate in them and (2) ways in which access to water markets becomes blocked for smaller, newer, or water-poor water users. We also highlight how UOG producers' presence may inhibit the formation of alternative systems for water exchange. Thus, the participation of UOG operators in Colorado's water markets appears to drive environmental injustice and increased inequity at the food-energy-water nexus, rather than facilitating fair or efficient access to water for all users.

   Publicly owned treatment facilities; Environmental justice
ID HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB In this paper, we examine the impact of droughts on industrial emissions into surface waters and transfers to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). We use industrial discharges into surface waters data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database. We employ runoffs normalized using previous 61-year average runoffs as a proxy for drought. We match both the discharges into surface waters and the runoffs at the 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) level. Our analysis indicates that normalized runoffs of the current and previous years positively influence industrial emissions into surface waters. We also find that the impact of uneven availability of water on emissions is higher on larger facilities. Normalized runoffs of the current and previous years do not have a statistically significant influence on transfers to publicly owned treatment works. However, normalized runoffs of the previous year do affect transfers of larger facilities. Businesses are dependent on water not only for their operations but to discharge their pollutants as well. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods. Therefore, every business that requires significant quantities of water must plan to cope with uneven availability of water.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN; LYNN WHITE; RELIGION; ATTITUDES; THESIS; PAPAL
AB The relationship between the Catholic Church and the world's poor is complicated by the link between concern for the earth and concern for the poor. To historically situate this relationship, in this article I examine thirty papal encyclical letters and three other salient documents issued by six Popes, spanning a period between publication of Rachel Carson's 1962 Silent Spring (a common starting-point for modern environmentalism) and Pope Francis' 2015 Laudato si' ['Praise Be to You']: On Care for our Common Home encyclical on climate change. Encyclicals were coded for changes in Catholic doctrine using a typology developed by sociologists of religion: from a 'Stewardship Ethic' rooted in individual sin, to an 'Eco-Justice' ethic, which bridges concern for the environment with concern for the poor, and finally, to an ethic of 'Creation Spirituality', which views humans and nature as inseparable. This analysis offered evidence of significant doctrinal shifts in Catholic social teaching toward a distinctively 'greener' reading of the tradition. Research on the religion-environment connection that focuses on describing and interpreting change over time offers robust means by which to assess whether, how, and to what extent religious organizations and their adherents engage with environmental issues.

AB Looking back from 2050, this article is written in the form of a fictional speech reflecting on the impressive progress made by 2050 towards achieving the global goal of zero net emissions. The speaker also highlights the severe and ongoing ecological damage and human suffering caused by the failure to reduce emissions with sufficient urgency in the first quarter of the 21st Century - and the ongoing challenge of implementing the actions required to bring global temperatures back below 1.5 degrees.
   The speech identifies the following key drivers of the 'great 21st century energy transition'.
   i) Sustained leadership from national and sub-national governments, business, civil society and the military in ratcheting up and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement.
   ii) The escalating frequency and severity of catastrophic climatic events.
   iii) Disruptive, game changing technological innovation including in energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy storage and distribution, transport, construction and agriculture.
   iv) Disruptive, game changing innovation in social, economic and political institutions and relationships including:
   increasing recognition of the importance of reducing the global consumption of goods and services;
   an ongoing shift towards more distributed and collaborative economic paradigms and systems;
   growing popular and political support for the global climate justice movement;
   radical improvements in the transparency and accountability of democratic and governance processes; and
   the mobilization of millions of citizens driving transformational change in investment flows, electoral outcomes and political choices.

DE Climate change; Cities; Planning; Justice
ID RESPONSIBILITY; ADAPTATION; MITIGATION; ETHICS
AB Ever since climate change came to be a matter of political concern, questions of justice have been at the forefront of academic and policy debates in the international arena. Curiously, as attention has shifted to other sites and scales of climate change politics matters of justice have tended to be neglected. In this paper, we examine how discourses of justice are emerging within urban responses to climate change. Drawing on a database of initiatives taking place in 100 global cities and qualitative case-study research in Philadelphia, Quito and Toronto, we examine how notions of distributive and procedural justice are articulated in climate change projects and plans in relation to both adaptation and mitigation. We find that there is limited explicit concern with justice at the urban level. However, where discourses of justice are evident there are important differences emerging between urban responses to adaptation and mitigation, and between those in the north and in the south. Adaptation responses tend to stress the distribution of 'rights' to protection, although those in the South also stress the importance of procedural justice. Mitigation responses also stress 'rights' to the benefits of responding to climate change, with limited concern for 'responsibilities' or for procedural justice. Intriguingly, while adaptation responses tend to stress the rights of individuals, we also find discourses of collective rights emerging in relation to mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The international climate change negotiations leading to and including the Copenhagen and Cancun Conferences of the Parties in 2009 and 2010 have shown a very different balance of power from those of the 1997 Kyoto round. This "New World dis(Order)" is characterized by insecurity of the United States in the face of economic and political decline vis-a-vis China; fragmentation of the Group of 77 developing nations negotiating bloc; and weakening of the European Union, which was cut out entirely from the group negotiating the Copenhagen Accord. In addition to old alignments of developing countries based on solidarity, negotiating blocs have fractured along lines of responsibility-for climate change, capability to address it, and national vulnerability to climate risks. This paper assesses whether, over the past two decades, negotiations have come closer to meeting basic criteria of international climate justice, and chronicles how environmental negotiations have come to reflect a different and shifting balance of power. Drawing insights from Giovanni Arrighi and Beverly Silver's analyses of US hegemonic decline and the rise of China, the article argues that the roots of the worst stubbornness by the US in recent climate talks lie in growing insecurity about its ability to provide jobs for its workers in a future where all sorts of work is moving to China and India.

AB Climate change mitigation policies can either facilitate or hinder progress towards health equity, and can have particular implications for Indigenous health. We sought to summarize current knowledge about the potential impacts (co-benefits and co-harms) of climate mitigation policies and interventions on Indigenous health. Using a Kaupapa Maori theoretical positioning, we adapted a validated search strategy to identify studies for this scoping review. Our review included empirical and modeling studies that examined a range of climate change mitigation measures, with health-related outcomes analyzed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Data were extracted from published reports and summarized. We identified 36 studies that examined a diverse set of policy instruments, with the majority located in high-income countries. Most studies employed conventional Western research methodologies, and few examined potential impacts of particular relevance to Indigenous peoples. The existing body of knowledge is limited in the extent to which it can provide definitive evidence about co-benefits and co-harms for Indigenous health, with impacts highly dependent on individual policy characteristics and contextual factors. Improving the quality of evidence will require research partnerships with Indigenous communities and study designs that centralize Indigenous knowledges, values, realities and priorities.

AB A large-scale transition to low-carbon energy sources is necessary to mitigate climate change. In practice, however, when new energy projects are proposed in specific places and regions, their proponents often face public resistance. This paper is a synthesis of a multi-investigator study of community responses to new energy developments in four Canadian provinces. We identify three questions that communities are asking about the governance of these projects: (1) Are the decision-making and regulatory processes open, rigorous, and accountable? (2) Have local people been meaningfully engaged? (3) Are the costs and benefits fairly distributed? Overall, we argue that public resistance is often a legitimate response stemming from inadequate governance of energy development. Specifically, and partly because of the changing role of government in policy-making and regulation, local communities lose trust that governance reflects and will protect their social and ecological values. We conclude that innovation in community engagement is needed, particularly in the context of rapid institutional change and governments that might be unable or unwilling to oversee inclusive decision-making processes.

AB Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) are increasing in Ghana amid a weak legal and regulatory framework. This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zai, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, ISLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property. The evidence supporting these arguments come from survey data on 619 plots, 70 in-depth interviews, village-level transect walks, and participant observations. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging debates at the interface of land use policy, climate justice, and sustainable adaptation. Theoretically, it also contributes to understanding State-society relations, as well as the political economy of eminent domain, often justified through discourses of "public benefits."

DE praxis; climate governance; democratization; politics of knowledge
ID POLITICAL ECOLOGY; LANDSCAPE; SCIENCE
AB Whether used to support or impede action, scientific knowledge is now, more than ever, the primary framework for political discourse on climate change. As a consequence, science has become a hegemonic way of knowing climate change by mainstream climate politics, which not only limits the actors and actions deemed legitimate in climate politics but also silences vulnerable communities and reinforces historical patterns of cultural and political marginalization. To combat this "post-political" condition, we seek to democratize climate knowledge and imagine the possibilities of climate praxis through an engagement with Gramscian political ecology and feminist science studies. This framework emphasizes how antihierarchical and experiential forms of knowledge can work to destabilize technocratic modes of governing. We illustrate the potential of our approach through ethnographic research with people in southern Appalachia whose knowledge of climate change is based in the perceptible effects of weather, landscape change due to exurbanization, and the potential impacts of new migrants they call "climate refugees." Valuing this knowledge builds more diverse communities of action, resists the extraction of climate change from its complex society-nature entanglements, and reveals the intimate connections between climate justice and distinct cultural lifeways. We argue that only by opening up these new forms of climate praxis, which allow people to take action using the knowledge they already have, can more just socioecological transformations be brought into being.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-LAW; HUMAN-RIGHTS; ADAPTATION; JUSTICE; STATIONARITY;
   IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; DEAD
AB The climate-policy debate has only recently turned its full attention to adaptation how to address the impacts of the climate change that we have already begun to experience and that will likely increase over time. Legal scholars have in turn begun to explore how the many different fields of law will and should respond. During this nascent period, one overarching question has gone unexamined: How will the legal system as a whole organize around climate change adaptation? Will a new, distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy emerge, or will legal institutions simply work away at the problem through unrelated, self-contained fields, as in the famous Law of the Horse? This Article is the first to examine that question comprehensively, to move beyond thinking about the law and climate change adaptation to consider the law of climate change adaptation.
   Part I of the Article lays out our methodological premises and approach. Using a model we call Stationarity Assessment, Part I explores how legal fields are structured and sustained based on assumptions about the variability of natural, social, and economic conditions, and how disruptions to that regime of variability can lead to the emergence of new fields of law and policy. Case studies of environmental law and environmental justice demonstrate the model's predictive power for the formation of new, distinct legal regimes.
   Part II applies the Stationarity Assessment model to the topic of climate change adaptation, using a case study of a hypothetical coastal region to demonstrate the potential for climate change impacts to disrupt relevant legal doctrines and institutions. We find that most fields of law appear to be capable of adapting effectively to climate change. In other words, without some active intervention, we expect the law and policy of climate change adaptation to follow the path of the Law of the Horse a collection of fields independently adapting to climate change rather than organically coalescing into a new and distinct field.
   Part III explores why, notwithstanding this conclusion, it may still be desirable to seek a different trajectory. Focusing on the likelihood of systemic adaptation decisions with perverse and harmful results, we identify the potential benefits offered by intervening to shape a new and distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy. Part IV then identifies the contours of such a field, exploring the distinct purposes of reducing vulnerability, ensuring resiliency, and safeguarding equity. These features provide the normative policy components for a law of climate change adaptation that would be more than just a Law of the Horse. This new field would not replace or supplant any existing field, however, as environmental law did with regard to nuisance law, and it would not be dominated by substantive doctrine. Rather, like the field of environmental justice, this new legal regime would serve as a holistic overlay across other fields to ensure more efficient, effective, and just climate adaptation solutions.

   extraction; Just transition
AB California has set ambitious climate policies, including economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. Yet levels of oil production and consumption remain high in the state. This gap between California's oil politics and its climate ambitions is deepened by decentralized decision-making processes. County officials are tasked with extractive planning decisions that have wide-ranging implications. In this Viewpoint article, we analyze proposals for enhanced extraction at the Cat Canyon oilfield in Santa Barbara County. After two of three proposals were withdrawn in recent months, we highlight how it has been oil industry volatility and public opposition - rather than state regulations - that have brought county development plans into closer alignment with state climate goals. As California pursues a goal of 'managing the decline' of domestic oil production, we identify strategies for bridging such gaps between local decision-making and state-level climate action, including: a comprehensive state-wide ban on new enhanced oil extraction projects; a 2,500 ft buffer zone around extraction sites; and revenue generation schemes that support a just transition. As Covid-19 forces an oil surplus and lowered production, there are opportunities to enact such changes - particularly by redirecting oil industry labor toward the growing problem of well decommissioning.

AB In this article, we focus on two demonstrations against climate change that took place in Portugal on the 12th of November 2016 and the 29th of April 2017. Two separate studies were conducted on the same protests. In Study 1, we conducted a quantitative study (N = 259), to examine the role of socio-demographics and socio-psychological predictors in predicting the actual protest. Participants were demonstrators (N = 158), as well as non-demonstrators (N = 101). Results indicated that moral motivation and identification as an environmentalist were the key variables in explaining actual protest. In Study 2, we conducted a framing analysis of the written manifestos (N = 2), to identify the core framing tasks which were used to inspire and legitimize the protests. The framing analysis suggests that the problems and paths for action were described by appealing to the interlinkage between the global and local dimensions of climate change, and that arguments of severity and urgency of the problem were the most salient. The implications of this research are discussed in relation to possible pathways for a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons why people engage in collective action in climate change related issues, and how these motives may relate to how social movements mobilize people for action.

AB As flood events become more intense and frequent, cities throughout the world increasingly devise projects for flood management and control, including hard and soft infrastructural solutions. Among these, an emblematic example is the project Parque Varzeas do Tiete (PVT) or Tiete Lowlands Park a 75 km-long floodplain restoration scheme proposed by the government of Sao Paulo, Brazil, to allegedly solve the city's flooding problem. The project's execution, however, is contingent on the removal of approximately 7500 low-income families, raising questions on the intertwined relationship between adaptation to flooding and the exclusion of informal urban settlements. Drawing on urban and feminist political ecology, we use the PVT as a case study to examine the politics and uneven outcomes of adaptation in Sao Paulo's eastern periphery. We combine archival and ethnographic work to expose the persistent politics of invisibility that sustain the project's exclusionary contours. In the process, we also demonstrate the various ways floodplain residents reshape their invisibility to contest, negotiate, and resist the PVT in the spaces of their everyday lives. As a result, the analysis identifies the project's perverse effects but also opportunities for productive engagements between the government and local communities towards more just, inclusive, and equitable adaptation futures in Sao Paulo, and beyond.

AB Access to affordable energy is a core dimension of energy justice, with recent work examining the relation between energy use and well-being in these terms. However, there has been relatively little examination of exactly which energy uses should be considered basic necessities within a given cultural context and so of concern for energy justice. We examine the inclusion of energy-using necessities within the outcomes of deliberative workshops within members of the public focused on defining a minimum-standard of living in the UK and repeated biannually over a six year period. Our secondary analysis shows that energy uses deemed to be necessities are diverse and plural, enabling access to multiple valued energy services, and that their profile has to some degree shifted from 2008 to 2014. The reasoning involved is multidimensional, ranging across questions of health, social participation, opportunity and practicality. We argue that public deliberations about necessities can be taken as legitimate grounding for defining minimum standards and therefore the scope of 'doing justice' in fuel poverty policy. However we set this in tension with how change over time reveals the escalation of norms of energy dependency in a society that on climate justice grounds must radically reduce carbon emissions.

ID INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE; NARRATIVES; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS
AB Narrative research is in vogue in the social sciences. A current debate in philosophy of economics concerns the role of storytelling in economic modelling, and a growing research programme in policy studies investigates the influence of stories on policy outcomes. These two streams of research have yet to be connected in an investigation of how scientific models, in addition to delivering numerical results, also shape policy through the stories that are told with them. This article addresses that gap, arguing that stories produced with integrated assessment models of global climate change are particular types of policy narratives. An analytical framework for studying their composition and content is suggested. The narrative analysis of modelled stories illuminates some of the models' underpinning values and beliefs. These values and beliefs influence the normative, policy-relevant conclusions generated with the models. For illustration, the framework is applied to the analysis of two variations of the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy model that are used to tell different stories about climate justice and climate policy.Key policy insights IAMs consist of mathematical structures and the stories told by manipulating these structures.There is an intricate but not fully deterministic relationship between IAM structures and stories.Examining both these elements contributes to our understanding of the models' role in climate governance.Appreciation of modelled stories may facilitate more effective use of IAMs in the policy process.

AB Background: Seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the northern hemisphere are well described in the literature. More recently age and gender differences in cardiac mortality and to a lesser extent morbidity have been presented. To date spatial differences between the seasonal patterns of cardiac disease has not been presented. Literature relating to seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the southern hemisphere and in Australia in particular is scarce. The aim of this paper is to describe the seasonal, age, gender, and spatial patterns of cardiac disease in Melbourne Australia by using acute myocardial infarction admissions to hospital as a marker of cardiac disease.
   Results: There were 33,165 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) admissions over 2186 consecutive days. There is a seasonal pattern in AMI admissions with increased rates during the colder months. The peak month is July. The admissions rate is greater for males than for females, although this difference decreases with advancing age. The maximal AMI season for males extends from April to November. The difference between months of peak and minimum admissions was 33.7%. Increased female AMI admissions occur from May to November, with a variation between peak and minimum of 23.1%. Maps of seasonal AMI admissions demonstrate spatial differences. Analysis using Global and Local Moran's I showed increased spatial clustering during the warmer months. The Bivariate Moran's I statistic indicated a weaker relationship between AMI and age during the warmer months.
   Conclusion: There are two distinct seasons with increased admissions during the colder part of the year. Males present a stronger seasonal pattern than females. There are spatial differences in AMI admissions throughout the year that cannot be explained by the age structure of the population. The seasonal difference in AMI admissions warrants further investigation. This includes detailing the prevalence of cardiac disease in the community and examining issues of social and environmental justice.

ID ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; CLIMATE; PHOENIX; TEMPERATURE; CONSUMPTION; DEMAND;

AB Recent efforts to influence the efficiency and timing of urban indoor water use through education, technology, conservation, reuse, economic incentives, and regulatory mechanisms have enabled many North American cities to accommodate population growth and buffer impacts of drought. It is unlikely that this approach will be equally successful into the future because the source of conservation will shift from indoor to outdoor use. Outdoor water is climate sensitive, difficult to measure, hard to predict, linked to other components of complex and dynamic urban resource systems, imbued with behavioral and cultural dimensions, and implicated in societal conflicts about climate risk, modern lifestyles, social justice, and future growth. Outdoor water conservation is not a traditional management problem focused on the water sector, assuming a stationary climate, and set aside from public debate. Instead, outdoor water is an adaptation problem, involving complex and uncertain system dynamics, the need for cross-sector coordination, strategies for dealing with climatic uncertainty, and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders with differing goals. This paper makes the case for treating outdoor water as an adaptation problem and offers a six-point strategy for how cities can better prepare their water systems for the uncertainties of climate and societal change.

DE nature-based solutions; sustainable urban development; green
   infrastructure; ecosystem services; climate change; adaptive governance
AB Nature-based solutions (NBS) are an innovative concept that mimics the processes of natural ecosystems, popularized principally in the European Union. With a substantial body of literature amassed since the term's inception in 2015, there is a need to systematically review existing literature to identify overarching gaps and trends, according to disciplinary focus, geographic scope, and key themes, and direct future research inquiry and policy recommendations. This review consists of bibliometric analysis and thematic analysis for NBS studies in urbanism. NBS studies were found to relate strongly with other concepts of 'Ecosystem Services', 'Green Infrastructure', 'Climate Change', and 'Risk management and Resilience', which align with four major thematic goals set by the European Commission. Within NBS scholarship, various sub-themes have emerged, namely, 'Greening', 'Urban Development', 'Water', 'Wellbeing', and 'Governance'. Furthermore, we illustrate that the amount and thematic focus of NBS research have been unevenly distributed worldwide. Analysis of emerging trends shows a recent increase in topics, such as adaptive governance of NBS, and the incorporation of social justice in sustainability transitions. Based on an assessment of extant NBS literature, we offer some recommendations for the future direction of the research fields.

AB A new food policy coherent with the goal of achieving sustainable food systems implies changing visions and radically revising the understanding of the system on which agricultural and food-related policies act. This paper identifies and discusses policy processes that contribute to sustainable food systems in Europe. Based on a conceptual framework that links the policy cycle approach to transition theories, we (i) assess the evolution of policy cycles of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to highlight how the food and nutrition concepts have evolved and been reframed throughout the five phases of the CAP, (ii) map and classify available policy instruments to assess potential synergies and gaps in view of their reorganization and (iii) indicate and discuss strategic tools for sustainable food policies. This contribution goes beyond the current literature highlighting the obstacles which hinder the transition to a policy regime that embodies the nexus among food and nutrition security, natural capital preservation and climatic and social justice, and proposing new avenues for food policy studies.

ID PATIENTS PREFERENCES; JUSTICE
AB When patients lack sufficient health care insurance, financial matters become integrally intertwined with biomedical considerations in the process of clinical decision making. With a growing medically indigent population, clinicians may be compelled to bend billing or reimbursement rules, lower standards, or turn patients away when they cannot afford the costs of care. This article focuses on 3 types of dilemmas that clinicians face when patients cannot pay for needed medical services: (1) whether to refer the individual to a safety net provider, such as a public clinic; (2) whether to forgo indicated tests and therapies because of cost; and (3) whether to reduce fees by fee waivers or other adjustments in billing. Clinicians' responses to these dilemmas impact on quality of care, continuity, safety net providers, and the liability risk of committing billing violations or offering nonstandard care. Caring for the underinsured in the current health care climate requires an understanding of billing regulations, a commitment to informed consent, and a beneficent approach to finding individualized solutions to each patient care/financial dilemma. To effect change, however, physicians must address issues of social justice outside of the office through political and social activism.

AB Driven by shared concerns about climate change, social justice and health and wellbeing, Urban Agriculture (UA) is an emergent global movement. In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of UA practice on the Southside of Glasgow, UK that traced the emergence and development of four UA projects. Data from the four projects revealed a diversity of practices, including temporary gardening projects organised by local volunteers, a community and market garden operated by a charity, a food shop and vegetable distribution service run by a social enterprise, and a permanent growing space for charities and schools provided by local government. UA practitioners in Glasgow have sought to re-purpose vacant and derelict land, build social cohesion, contribute to environmental and food sustainability and provide participation space for marginalised groups. Reflecting on future avenues for research on UA in Glasgow, we have identified two broad policy pathways that are emerging both at the local level and through national legislation in Scotland to harness local urban food growing and support UA. We conclude by pointing to a need to preserve the self-organising spirit of UA in Scotland as new legislation comes into force.

Following a lengthy drought at the turn of the century concerns were raised about water quality and river health. This led successive governments to introduce policies to systematically reduce water available for irrigated agriculture. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was developed by the Commonwealth government and is designed to secure water savings from irrigators and to direct those water savings to the stressed natural environment. This paper focuses on the impact of these changes on irrigation dairy families and their communities in northern Victoria. Using a model designed to test the limits to adaptation, we draw out the constraints, limits and barriers to adaptation for dairy families and their communities coping with reduced water access. This model highlights the types of socially just and fair interventions necessary to assist adaptation and foctises attention on thresholds and traps that may prevent adaptation. The model is relevant to other areas where climate changes and environmental disasters are shaping inevitable change.

AB This paper outlines a synthesis of ecological economics with econophysics and other complexity approaches to economics. Arguably, the resulting "ecological econophysics" will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the world's population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic system's architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.

AB Conflict is an important factor in ongoing climate change debates and its role in management is under increasing scrutiny. In this paper, I present the results of an advanced discourse analysis that analyses trends in the relationship between conflict and climate change. I present two primary discourses dominate discussion: (i) climate as a security risk and (ii) climate as one of many factors affecting power relations that may lead to conflict. Both narratives implicitly or explicitly discuss climate conflict as a cause-outcome relationship, and further primarily construct conflict and climate change within normative frames. Yet, conflict has transformative potential and can be incorporated into management in ways that harness its capacity to drive innovation and lead to more robust and just adaptive governance. I argue for a shift in the discursive frame from a cause-outcome-oriented approach to a process-driven approach, one that treats conflict as an integral part of adaptive governance processes, thus being more just and equitable. Such a shift in focus can lead to positive on ground climate adaptation outcomes, in ways that respect rather than are counterintuitive to dominant political and societal imbalances and institutional structures.

AB Legal institutions and instruments will play an important role in climate change adaptation, along with technological, managerial, and behavioral strategies. Law can facilitate adaptation, using regulation to reduce exposure or sensitivity to climate hazards, establishing the legal architecture for new market mechanisms, and funding arrangements for adaptation costs and liability for climate impacts. It can also ensure the accountability of adaptation decision making and addressing some of the social justice dimensions of adaptation. Yet there are also characteristics of legal institutions, processes, and principles that may impede adaptation, including by creating compensable property rights that hinder new regulation. There are several characteristics of climate change and associated impacts that will make law-making for adaptation uniquely challenging. These include high levels of cascading uncertainty, irreversibility, the context-specificity of impacts, the long delay between emissions and impacts, and the interaction between climate change impacts and other environmental, social, and economic stressors. Laws dealing with substantive climate impacts may be appropriate and necessary in some cases, but the broader challenge for law-makers is to make legal processes and instruments more adaptive and responsive to change itself.

AB Interest in climate service efforts continues to grow. However, more critical analysis could enhance how well climate services align with the needs of society. Collaborations between Native American Tribes (Tribes) and Climate Science Organizations (CSOs) providing decision-support for climate change planning accentuate the potential for climate services to have social justice implications through either deepening or softening existing inequities. This paper compares 30 Tribe-affiliated and 36 CSO-affiliated individuals' perceptions about potential harms and benefits associated with their collaborations with one another. The importance of the potential benefits of collaborations listed outweighed the potential harms listed for both groups, but while climate science organizations rated the potential benefits listed slightly higher than Tribes did, the potential harms listed were much more salient for Tribes. This finding highlights concerns that, without proper training and management, these collaborations may reinforce unequal relationships between settler and Indigenous populations. While CSOs appeared cognizant of their Tribe-affiliated colleagues' concerns, transitioning from a focus on building trust to establishing and sustaining shared systems of responsibilities might help these collaborations meet the needs of both groups more effectively.

AB The present article aims to encourage social services to adopt an anti-oppressive perspective in the development of services for people living in poverty, and proposes some theoretical and organisational considerations to transform these services. In the last three decades, neo-liberal and managerial ideologies have consistently favoured social policies that generate high levels of poverty, an anti-welfare political climate, punitive welfare reforms, periodic budgetary cutbacks and the subsequent decay of the social service sector. These processes impaired the capacity of many social services to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable constituencies. They also undermined the social workers' ability to fulfil some of their main social missions: promoting social change and pursuing social justice. The present article calls for social services for the poor to restore this fundamental social mission by adopting an anti-oppressive approach. The article is organised around three sections: first, it examines the relationship between poverty and oppression; second, it reviews the relevant literature on anti-oppressive organisations; and third, it lays down the theoretical and organisational principles of the development of anti-oppressive social services for the poor.

AB The marginal people of the Indian part of Sunderbans (SDB) do now subsist 'between two fires' - climate change and climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. They have already felt the fire of climate change in terms of loss of livelihoods, homelessness, and even life harm. They have begun recently to experience the fire of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. The fallout of this situation, thus, comes in form of mass-exodus, and social and political conflicts at the margin. This article tells a story of how the postcolonial government in India, like its predecessor i.e. the British colonialists, would orchestrate a concerted effort in accumulation-based development in the name of conservation of SDB. Critically engaging the trajectory of policy interventions including the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the Draft National Forest Policy, 2018 and the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers (Recognition of forest rights) act, 2006, it explores the dynamic way in which the government uses the climate change and conservation excuse to evict the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers from the forestlands. In conclusion, this article argues why we should go beyond the capitalist 'growth' narrative in order to formulate a more grounded climate and social justice legislation.

AB This article focuses on the complex relationship between development and disaster risk. Development and disaster risk are closely linked as the people and assets exposed to risk, as well as their vulnerability and capacity, are largely determined by development processes. Transformation is key to moving from current development patterns that increase, create or unfairly distribute risks, to forms of development that are equitable, resilient and sustainable. Based on a review of existing literature, we present three opportunities that have the potential to lead to transformation in the development-disaster risk relationship: (i) exposing development-disaster risk trade-offs in development policy and decision-making; (ii) prioritizing equity and social justice in approaches to secure resilience; and (iii) enabling transformation through adaptive governance. This research aims to contribute to breaking down existing barriers in research, policy and practice between the disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and development communities by providing cross-sectoral opportunities to operationalize theoretical knowledge on transformation. It also helps to clarify the connections between different global agendas by positioning transformation as a potential bridging concept to link disconnected policy processes. This paper argues for empirical research to test the opportunities presented here and further define transformative pathways at multiple scales.

DE Pope Francis; Encyclical Letter; Ecology; Environment; Indigenous;

AB Pope Francis' Encyclical Letter "Laudato Si': Encyclical on Climate Change and Inequality, On Care for Our Common Home" revives the Catholic Church social justice tradition to unite the concern for environmental degradation, with the attention to society, especially the poor. With a narrative of remarkable humaneness, Pope Francis' ecology discourse focuses on environmental emergency and misuse of resources, social and economic consumerism, notions of responsibility and exclusion of marginal communities. Based on an analysis of Pope Francis' encyclical letter, this article elaborates a framework for rethinking ecology in the context of the Pacific Islands Indigenous cultures who are suffering directly as a result of climate change. I suggest that Pope Francis' affirmative ecology promotes an "integral and shared development," the intimately interdependent relationship between humankind and nature, which echoes the Pacific Indigenous intersubjective dimensions of environment. Environmental care and attention rely both on a moral individual and collective responsibility, rather than regulatory adjustments that underestimate traditional cultural and social practices. For Pacific Indigenous communities, Pope Francis' analysis is provocative, for it not only offers new hope for the future but also because it calls into question basic assumptions about global consumption and common ways of living that have negatively affected the environment of this region.

AB Current sustainability challenges demand approaches that acknowledge a plurality of human-nature interactions and worldviews, for which biocultural approaches are considered appropriate and timely. This systematic review analyses the application of biocultural approaches to sustainability in scientific journal articles published between 1990 and 2018 through a mixed methods approach combining qualitative content analysis and quantitative multivariate methods. The study identifies seven distinct biocultural lenses, that is, different ways of understanding and applying biocultural approaches, which to different degrees consider the key aspects of sustainability science-inter- and transdisciplinarity, social justice and normativity. The review suggests that biocultural approaches in sustainability science need to move from describing how nature and culture are co-produced to co-producing knowledge for sustainability solutions, and in so doing, better account for questions of power, gender and transformations, which has been largely neglected thus far.

TI Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from
   comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID VULNERABILITY; HIV/AIDS
AB Background: While there has recently been significant medical advance in understanding and treating HIV, limitations in understanding the complex social dimensions of HIV/AIDS epidemics continue to restrict a host of prevention and development efforts from community through to international levels. These gaps are rooted as much in limited conceptual development as they are in a lack of empirical research.
   Methods: In this conceptual article, the authors compare and contrast the evolution of climate change and AIDS research. They demonstrate how scholarship and response in these two seemingly disparate areas share certain important similarities, such as the "globalization" of discourses and associated masking of uneven vulnerabilities, the tendency toward techno-fixes, and the polarization of debates within these fields. They also examine key divergences, noting in particular that climate change research has tended to be more forward-looking and longer-term in focus than AIDS scholarship.
   Conclusion: Suggesting that AIDS scholars can learn from these key parallels and divergences, the paper offers four directions for advancing AIDS research: (1) focusing more on the differentiation of risk and responsibility within and among AIDS epidemics; (2) taking (back) on board social justice approaches; (3) moving beyond polarized debates; and (4) shifting focus from reactive to forward-looking and proactive approaches.

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE global citizenship; sustainability; corporate responsibility
AB Sustainability education has tended to focus on how governments manage resource exploitation and conservation at national, regional and global levels via meetings such as the Earth Summit process or international climate change negotiations. Alternatively the emphasis has been on individual consumers and the environmental impacts of their various lifestyle choices and related carbon footprint et cetera. Business Schools have only relatively recently engaged with the concept of sustainability, largely in terms of corporate social responsibility or innovative business practices to reduce waste and increase profit. This position is changing though as the corporate sector increasingly seeks graduates with worldviews and competencies aligned with sustainability. The Oath Project at Nottingham Trent University addresses the increased demand from the business sector to employ graduates who have an understanding of global issues, are willing to engage in inter-cultural dialogues and who are self-aware and reflective on their position and input into large-scale processes that have impacts on environmental sustainability and aspects of social justice. The Project also intends to maintain a database of alumni to facilitate a longer-term study of the career paths of graduates to monitor and assess the extent to which global citizenship competencies are maintained once these students gain employment.

ID POLICIES
AB The quest for achieving a sustainable future and addressing climate change risks by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the policy challenges raised by wicked public policy problems, such as poverty and inequality issues, the risks of policy failures from legal innovations and the search for behaviourally effective governance models, all these aspects of the sustainability challenge are illustrated in the specific context of the biofuel weed crop risk case study which provides the basis for the present discussion around sustainable governance innovations, implementation issues and the need for new research directions to achieve key sustainable goals. Drawing upon empirical findings, this publication intends to highlight the key lessons that can be learned from this case study for the purpose of implementing governance innovations in the context of the new United Nations sustainable development goals adopted in 2015. It particularly highlights three main research directions in areas which remain underexplored in environmental legal research for improving governance models and achieving a sustainable future. These are the use of non-legal perspectives from the social sciences for improving environmental law scholarship, further enquiry into risk concepts, and the incorporation of social justice considerations into environmental market-based approaches.

AB The negative impacts of environmental disruption disproportionately affect marginalized and underprivileged communities; thus, the degree to which society is complicit in allowing unchecked environmental destruction to occur has important social justice applications. Although decades of research have sought to understand factors which determine acceptance of environmental destruction, most of this research has been based on self-report surveys. In the present work, we used neuroimaging techniques to examine the neural correlates of environmental concern. To do this, we compared responses to observing suffering dogs with responses to observing suffering ecosystems. Our results extend previous findings which had shown largely overlapping neural response patterns to observing animal and human suffering. Critically, we found activation in regions previously identified as active in empathy processes in response to viewing harm to ecosystems (i.e., without any animals present in the images). We also found relative differences in response patterns between the two types of stimuli: witnessing harm to environments (vs. dog suffering) led to reduced activation in some regions, but similar activation in others. We discuss these findings in terms of their potential implications for behavioral interventions and possibilities for continued neuroimaging research examining neural responses to environmental ecosystems and other nonhuman entities.

AB Food systems are under pressure from population growth, climate change, resource scarcity and increasing urbanization. Alternative food networks are initiatives related to food provision that operate at a local level and are concerned with both environmental stewardship and social justice. This paper presents a case study of alternative food networks operating in Brisbane and Melbourne in order to analyze: i) their socio-economic and environmental contributions to the resilience and sustainability of urban food systems; and, ii) the limitations that alternative food networks are facing. The cases researched include examples of urban agriculture, food hubs, buyers' groups, and specialist retailers. The results indicate that alternative food networks can improve access to healthy food, provide fairer conditions for farmers, reduce food loss/waste, increase environmental protection, and facilitate climate change adaptation. The limitations to the expansion of alternative food networks are also discussed, including the restricted access to land for growing food, low public engagement, and the dependence on volunteer labor. The paper concludes by summarizing the contribution of alternative food networks to urban food systems and identifies issues for future research.

TI What Happened To Our Community Of Practice? The Early Development Of
   Adult Basic Education In NSW Through The Lens Of Professional Practice
   Theory
SO LITERACY AND NUMERACY STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The field of adult basic education had its genesis as a named field of education in the English speaking world in the mid-1970s, emerging from humanist discourses of social justice and a sociocultural view of literacy. Subsequent decades of its development have involved recurrent and destabilising periods of change with a major and overriding theme being the move away from the humanist philosophy, towards an economically driven, human capital view of literacy, which mirrors the story of a number of other social programs in their trajectory towards the 'new capitalism'. This paper considers the first fifteen years, or genesis, of the field of adult basic education in the state of New South Wales in Australia through official documents and archival material and through the stories from practice told by the teachers. Analysis of these stories using a theory of professional practice knowledge demonstrates the ways in which the early field of professional practice emerged as a product of its particular socio-political climate, and demonstrates also the strong convergence between the public discourses and the professional discourses surrounding the field in this period; a convergence which was progressively weakened in subsequent decades.

AB Energy poverty, understood as deprivation of energy services linked to satisfy human basic needs, is a strengthened research topic which is gaining relevance in Social Sciences. We point out that energy poverty affects millions of families in Mexico, so there is a need for overcoming this social justice problem. Hence, this paper presents a methodological framework to characterize families according to their levels of deprivation of energy services and, furthermore, identify the determining factors of these different levels of deprivation. Our results indicate that five groups of homes exist: one which does not lack any energy service; two which lack only one energy service; and two which lack the majority of energy services. Those variables which most precisely explain the probability that a home be found in each of these groups are per-capita income, size of settlement (urban or rural), and type of climate. We conclude our findings have public policy implications in that, upon characterizing households based on their level of deprivation of energy services, sound strategies may be designed and implemented to attend to the specific needs of each household group.

AB HMS Investigator, the British Navy vessel that discovered the North-West Passage in 1850, helped to stake Britain's claim to Arctic territory. Her crew's colonial attitudes towards the Indigenous Inuit inhabitants of the region have been perpetuated in archaeological interpretations of the ship's impact on local Inuit communities and in media coverage of the rediscovery of the ship by archaeologists in 2010, which framed the ship as a symbol of Canada's Arctic sovereignty. As climate change continues to fuel international debates about the control of Arctic resources and to negatively impact the Arctic archaeological record, Arctic archaeology promises to become increasingly political. In the Canadian Arctic, a range of collaborative projects that bring together archaeologists and Inuit community groups to better understand the human history of the north have made important steps towards decolonizing our discipline and could ripple outwards to support Inuit demands for a voice in international debates about Arctic sovereignty. Should we choose, these projects could also work to change the way the past is mobilized and presented beyond archaeological circles, contributing more directly to social justice on a broader scale.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; FUTURE
AB While initial discussions of the third mission of universities focussed on market-orientated behaviours of universities, more recently it has been connected to activities that focus on social justice and promoting sustainability (Trencher, Bai, Evans, McCormick & Yarime, 2014; Appe & Barragan, 2017). It has been suggested that the third mission of universities in the Global South may be particularly significant in addressing acutely felt issues of climate change, economic inequalities, food insecurity and urban sprawl. The current paper explores this and asks whether the quadruple helix (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010) is visible in their engagement activities.
   Using a synthesis of case studies developed as part of the 'Strengthening Urban Engagement of Universities in Africa and Asia' (SUEUAA) project, a collaborative research project spanning seven cities (Glasgow; Harare; Dar-es-Salaam; Johannesburg; Duhok; Sanandaj; and Manila), we explore ongoing engagement activities where universities respond to city demand. We frame this in terms of Sustainable Development Goals.
   Results indicate while universities were seen to address city demands, they often reacted without a network of other influential actors (i.e. industry, local government or NGO partners). This suggests that currently, the quadruple helix is underdeveloped in these cities, and more work should be done in creating closer links.

ID FRAMEWORK; FUTURE; SNOW
AB The role of tourism in local development, combined with globalisation and climate change, are generating both opportunities and threats across Arctic communities. The impacts of climate change are felt more intensely in communities that are dependent on natural resources. This is increasingly occurring through Arctic tourism, which is often based on nature, and is the foundation of the economy of many small Arctic communities. The interplay between tourism and community-based adaptation represents a significant focus in Arctic tourism studies and can bring invaluable information to governments about the local level climate change impacts on livelihoods and on the potential future challenges. The results from a vulnerability study conducted in two case study communities in Finnish Lapland indicate that both external and internal stresses, combined with the impacts of climate change, force the communities to reconsider their current development paths. The communities are still able to absorb the changes taking place in weather patterns, but the current development paths do not fully support the idea of sustainable adaptation, with its concepts of environmental integrity, social justice and participation. Though several adaptation strategies are deployed, future vulnerability may increase due to ineffective adaptation mechanisms and the increasing role of nature in tourism development.

AB This paper studies public perceptions of fairness in managed retreat policies. We try to empirically test the acceptance of the following four principles of fairness: efficiency, need, responsibility and priority to property rights. Using responses from a questionnaire, the objective of the paper is to generate information on the issue of solidarity between people exposed to the risk of climate-change-induced flooding and those who are not, as regards to funding managed retreat policies and damage compensation. To that end two population zones (Coastal and Hinterland) were surveyed in order to characterise personal preferences of stakeholders and distributive preferences of third parties Results show (i) a support for national solidarity in the funding of managed retreat policies, (ii) a difference in people'ssupport for the responsibility principle depending on whether it is embedded in a general principle of justice or in a particular compensation scheme and (iii) a difference between distributional judgments of the coastal inhabitants (stakeholders) and those of the Hinterland (third parties) according to the choices of the funding principles of damages on private assets and the choices of the general principles of fairness in managed retreat policies.

AB Climate change adaptation is now a core theme of Australian geographical research. Climatic risks to socio-ecosystems are unbounded and highly uncertain and as a result require learning-based approaches to generate appropriate adaptation responses. Geographical research can effectively integrate knowledge developed through the mutual learning of researchers and stakeholders within a place to help guide adaptation planning. The roles of the geographer as a social learning researcher are critically analysed within the context of climate change adaptation research undertaken to support regional natural resource management adaptation planning in South Australia. Three research roles from the social learning literature are used to frame the analysis: the organic intellectual; the advocate for social justice; and the contemporary professional academic. While the social learning helped to develop a range of experimental adaptation policies and actions, the research would have proceeded more effectively if the challenges of the approach had been initially understood. The problems which emerge from social learning research, including inevitable tensions between real-world and academic outcomes, need to be acknowledged along with any successes to prepare future geographers to facilitate learning about socio-ecological risk.

AB Energy justice has emerged as a useful lens for understanding and guiding energy decision-making. However, whilst calls for greater energy justice have grown, fleeting attention has been paid to the role and agency of the very people at the heart of this agenda. Clearly, given the increasing prevalence of local energy initiatives, such projects warrant more sustained focus both to explore how energy justice is constructed between settings and to prompt greater consideration of its associated outcomes. This paper seeks to address this gap by using energy justice to assess local ownership of small scale energy generation through a study of the community energy sector in Wales. In so doing, it aids greater understanding of the energy equity dimension, understood in terms of accessibility and affordability, of the energy trilemma. From a conceptual standpoint, the research examines how energy justice is negotiated and contested at community-scale through a focus on issues of distributive and procedural justice. From a policy standpoint, the research shows that community energy is often involved in a wide range of local objectives and directs attention to how best to support such initiatives to further stimulate local action and deliver more widespread equity gains.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; CARBON; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; MARKETS; DESIGN
AB One of the most popular policy mechanisms for greenhouse gas emissions regulation is cap-and-trade which is a market-based approach that has come to dominate partially because of its flexibility. With flexibility, however, comes the potential for the clustering of greenhouse gas emissions. To understand whether emissions trading leads to localized clustering of emissions changes, we perform a systematic, spatio-economic assessment of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We analyze the spatial pattern of emissions changes from individual plants across the EU as well as how the pattern changes during the first two phases of the ETS implementation. Our findings indicate that there was clustering of emissions changes at the EU and country level which peaked at the start of the second phase but declined as the EU ETS matured. We also found that iron and steel, coke ovens, and refining have greater clustering and volatility compared to other industries. Based on the air quality implications of these clustered emissions, certain countries and industry types might need additional attention during the ETS design or redesign process. This study makes a novel contribution by systematically evaluating the spatio-temporal and equity implications of emissions distribution in cap-and-trade systems.

AB This paper investigates the values and priorities reflected in a Canadian pipeline review: The National Energy Board (NEB) decision on Line 9. Theories of energy justice guided analysis of evidence presented at NEB hearings, the NEB's explanation of its decision, and a Supreme Court challenge. We find that several aspects of energy justice were weak in the NEB process. First, a project-specific scope obstructed the pursuit of equity within and between generations: the pipeline's contributions to climate change, impacts of the oil sands, and cumulative encroachment on Indigenous lands were excluded from review. Second, the NEB created a hierarchy of knowledge: it considered evidence of potential spill impacts as hypothetical while accepting as fact the proponent's claim that it could prevent and manage spills. Third, recognition of diversity remained elusive: Indigenous nations' dissatisfaction with the process challenged the NEB's interpretation of meaningful consultation and procedural fairness. To address the challenges of climate change and reconciliation between Indigenous and settler nations, it is crucial to identify which kinds of evidence decision-makers recognize as valid and which they exclude. Ideas from energy justice can help support actions to improve the public acceptability of energy decisions, as well as to foster greater Indigenous autonomy.

AB Vulnerability and resilience to extreme weather hazards are a function of diverse physical, social, and psychological factors. Previous research has focused on individual factors that influence public perceptions of hazards, such as politics, ideology, and cultural worldviews, as well as on socioeconomic and demographic factors that affect geographically based vulnerability, environmental justice, and community resilience. Few studies have investigated individual socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in public risk perceptions of the health hazards associated with extreme heat events, which are now increasing due to climate change. This study uses multilevel statistical modeling to investigate individual- and geographic-level (e.g., census tract level and regional) social, economic, and biophysical influences on public perceptions of the adverse health impacts associated with heat waves. Political orientation and climate change beliefs are the strongest predictors of heat wave health risk perceptions; household income also has a relatively strong and consistent effect. Contextual socioeconomic vulnerability, measured with a social vulnerability index at the census tract level, also significantly affects heat wave risk perceptions. The strong influence of political orientation and climate beliefs on perceptions of adverse health impacts from heat waves suggests that ideological predispositions can increase vulnerability to climate change.

AB Island nations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including changes in sea level, storms, coastal erosion, and freshwater availability. The purpose of this cross-cultural study is to understand how emotional responses to climate change are inequitably distributed across people living in island nations with varying climate change vulnerability. We consider how emotional responses (particularly sadness, worry, anger, happiness, and hope) may be related to people's biophysical vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and likelihood of relocation in the face of climate change. Using data from 272 ethnographic interviews collected in local communities in Fiji, Cyprus, New Zealand, and England, we explore the emotional reactions of respondents to current and future effects of climate change. Our results demonstrate that respondents in island nations with greater biophysical vulnerability are more likely to be concerned about relocation as a result of climate change, and they are also more likely to indicate their sadness or anger. Countries with higher adaptive capacity and lower biophysical vulnerability are more likely to suggest that, though they are sad about the effects of climate change, they feel neutral about its overall effect. This research demonstrates how focusing on emotional responses within communities affected by climate change brings important and under-explored dimensions of climate-related environmental injustice into sharp relief.

AB As rapid urban development continues, the impacts of temperature extremes on human health and comfort are expected to increase as threshold temperatures of human tolerance are crossed more frequently and for longer periods of time. This study examined extreme heat as an urban hazard throughout the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) metropolitan area during a four-day 2005 summer heat wave. Utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate 2 m air temperature variability throughout the region, the distribution of threshold temperatures and heat exposure was examined in 40 diverse neighborhoods. Neighborhood residents also responded to a social survey about perceived temperatures and heat-related health problems during the summer of 2005.
   Results indicated that extreme heat was variably distributed throughout the neighborhoods; residents' perceptions of temperature and self-reported experiences with heat-related illnesses were related to environmental conditions; the highest risk of exposure to extreme heat was among elderly, minority, and low-income residents; and land use/cover characteristics exhibited strong relationships with local threshold temperatures. Research contributions include the development of a geotechnical analysis method that could help cities to prepare for and respond to the most vulnerable residents during periods of extreme heat as well as the interrelation of regional atmospheric model results with socio-economic data.

AB Indigenous peoples, who depend on their environment for livelihoods and are often subject to poverty and socio-economic marginalization, are some of the most vulnerable to climate change. While the rights of Indigenous peoples are recognized internationally, these are not translated into adaptation responses. Using insights from theories of environmental justice in the case of Uganda's Batwa community, we assess how justice-related factors impact their adaptive capacities and whether these are incorporated in the design and implementation of adaptation responses. Our findings reveal a multi-dimensional range of systemic injustices experienced by Batwa, resulting from their continued social-economic, cultural and political marginalization. Additionally, a variety of projects are happening locally in relation to 'adaptation' but not labelled as such, suggesting how Batwa's vulnerability is rooted in wider aspects of livelihoods and development. Most projects tend to focus on distribution of material benefits, while less attention is paid to the more intricate issues of compensation, political discrimination and uneven participation. This depoliticized and compartmentalized approach suggests a slow and incomplete way of operationalizing justice. Hence, we call for sincere efforts to address recognition, rights, and disproportionate levels of disadvantage for Indigenous communities, including their constitutional recognition, financial redress and participation in decision-making.

AB Environmental health literacy (EHL) has recently been defined as the continuum of environmental health knowledge and awareness, skills and self-efficacy, and community action. In this study, an interdisciplinary team of university scientists, partnering with local organizations, developed and facilitated EHL trainings with special focus on rainwater harvesting and water contamination, in four communities with known environmental health stressors in Arizona, USA. These participatory trainings incorporated participants' prior environmental health risk knowledge and personal experiences to co-create training content. Mixed methods evaluation was conducted via pre-post participant surveys in all four trainings (n = 53). Participants who did not demonstrate baseline environmental science knowledge pre-training demonstrated significant knowledge increase post-training, and participants who demonstrated low self-efficacy (SE) pre-training demonstrated a significant increase in SE post-training. Participants overall demonstrated a significant increase in specific environmental health skills described post-training. The interdisciplinary facilitator-scientist team also reported multiple benefits, including learning local knowledge that informed further research, and building trust relationships with community members for future collaboration. We propose contextual EHL education as a valuable strategy for increasing EHL in environmental health risk communities, and for building academia-community partnerships for environmental health research and action.

AB With the national push for an ecological civilization under way, Chinese environmental governance is becoming more authoritarian as the central government exerts a stronger control over the enforcement of environmental policies. In this paper, I examine how the ecological civilization project has become a key driver of change in extractive regions, constituting new eco-politics of extractive governance that can be characterized by heightened authoritarian environmentalism, with the Central Environmental Inspection Team as a particularly important mechanism through which the centralization of environmental governance is achieved. I argue that the ambitious environmental goals of an ecological civilization are achieved by sacrificing the interests of extractive communities. As these vulnerable communities are highly dependent on their extractive industries and often face significant diversification difficulties, the eco-civilization project has devastating local socioeconomic impacts and are likely to accelerate structural decline and population shrinkage if not promptly addressed through external support. I argue that this constitutes a form of environmental injustice, where environmental policies impose unfair burdens on disadvantaged individuals and communities. In particular, extractive communities bear the greatest burden of both environmental exploitation and environmental protection. Achieving socially just environmental sustainability should be an important aspect of ecological civilization.

AB Shale gas has become an energy policy priority in the United Kingdom in light of profitable extraction activities in the United States. Since 2012 the Coalition Government has created key economic drivers to encourage shale exploration, whilst growing activism in affected site communities has stirred significant media and academic commentary. This study examines the growing national debate as a matter of discourse, adopting an argumentative discourse analytic approach to assess data collected from stakeholder interviews (n=21) and key policy actor statements quoted in broadsheet newspapers. We explore three dominant "storylines" emerging in relation to shale gas policy: (1) "cleanliness and dirt" concerns the relative framing of the environmental benefits and harms of shale gas; (2) "energy transitions - pathways and diversions" concerns geographic metaphors of transitions to carbon intensive and low-carbon energy systems; and (3) "geographies of environmental justice" concerns divisions of economic benefit distribution, environmental impact and procedural fairness. We find that central government policy rhetoric emphasises economic development, regulatory oversight and distribution of benefits to site communities, whilst minimising discussion of the implications of shale gas for anthropogenic climate change. The role of these discourses in influencing shale gas policy is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While awareness is growing that ethical and justice-based debates hold implications for the development of fair and effective climate policy, the specific ethical implications of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) deployment have received limited attention. Here, we present a preliminary assessment of ethical attitudes to CCS. The aim was to develop a methodology which can support a clear scoping out of potential issues and to lay the foundations from which to develop a fully deliberative approach. This article draws largely upon the empirical analysis and results with some reference to the method. An ethical matrix approach is used to provide a summary of a so-called ethical landscape, primarily from a European perspective, in which perspectives of CCS are mapped out as they relate to certain ethical principles. Opinions represented on the matrix begin to coalesce around compliance with the principle of providing benefits (a pre-requisite of pursuing development) while potential faultlines were observed for the following principles: environmental justice, preventing harm, scientific/technical competence, managerial/regulatory competence. Accountability (in the context of long term storage) was revealed to present a key challenge, exposing the current immaturity of legal and regulatory frameworks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Trinidad and Tobago is an oil exporting small island developing state (SIDS) with a 0.12% contribution to global emissions and with important socio-economic challenges. It has producer, electricity and transport fuel subsidies. It is at an interesting juncture in subsidy reform: the government faces the embeddedness of distributive justice norms that are contested by fiscal prudence and environmental stewardship norms. The value of the paper is twofold. First it develops a subsidy intractability framework to explain reform global narratives that highlights: the power of agents, the nature of contested economic, justice and environmental norms and the availability of mechanisms for reform. Second, this framework is used to explain reform narratives and trajectories in Trinidad and Tobago using data from public documents and from a unique elite survey of former and present heads of state, politicians, policy makers and stakeholders. Even in conditions of falling oil prices and national revenue and pressures to reduce emissions, where redistributive justice arguments are heavily embedded in public discourses, those aspects of the subsidy that have developmental or distributive justice goals are more intractable. The results of the study have implications for carbon emission reduction strategies in developing states with fossil fuel reserves.

AB Energy justice has emerged as a new crosscutting social science research agenda which seeks to apply justice principles to energy policy, energy production and systems, energy consumption, energy activism, energy security and climate change. A conceptual review is now required for the consolidation and logical extension of this field. Within this exploration, we give an account of its core tenets: distributional, recognition and procedural. Later we promote the application of this three-pronged approach across the energy system, within the global context of energy production and consumption. Thus, we offer both a conceptual review and a research agenda. Throughout, we explore the key dimensions of this new agenda - its evaluative and normative reach-demonstrating that energy justice offers, firstly, an opportunity to explore where injustices occur, developing new processes of avoidance and remediation and recognizing new sections of society. Secondly, we illustrate that energy justice provides a new stimulating framework for bridging existing and future research on energy production and consumption when whole energy systems approaches are integrated into research designs. In conclusion, we suggest three areas for future research: investigating the non-activist origins of energy justice, engaging with economics, and uniting systems of production and consumption.

AB Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.

AB Context Ecological research, from organismal to global scales and spanning terrestrial, hydrologic, and atmospheric domains, can contribute more to reducing health vulnerabilities. At the same, ecological research directed to health vulnerabilities provides a problem-based unifying framework for urban ecologists.
   Objective Provide a framework for expanding ecological research to address human health vulnerabilities in cities.
   Methods I pose an urban ecology of human health framework that considers how the ecological contributions to health risks and benefits are driven by interacting influences of the environment, active management, and historical legacies in the context of ecological self-organization. The ecology of health framework is explored for contrasting examples includingheat, vector borne diseases, pollution, and accessible greenspace both individually and in a multifunctional landscape perspective.
   Results Urban ecological processes affect human health vulnerability through contributions to multiple hazard and well-being pathways. The resulting multifunctional landscape of health vulnerability features prominent hotspots and regional injustices. A path forward to increase knowledge of the ecological contributions to health vulnerabilities includes increased participation in in interdisciplinary teams and applications of high resolution environmental sensing and modeling.
   Conclusions Research and management from a systems and landscape perspective of ecological processes is poised to help reduce urban health vulnerability and provide a better understanding of ecological dynamics in the Anthropocene.

AB Open-pit coal mining in Cesar, Colombia increased by 74% between 2000 and 2012, generating environmental and social damages unacknowledged by companies and the state. This study aims to identify and value socio-environmental liabilities from coal mining at different stages of the coal life cycle. Environmental liabilities can be operationalized under three types of responsibilities: moral, legal, and economic. The identification of environmental liabilities allocates moral responsibility; the legal responsibility is needed for effective reparation; and the economic valuation provides arguments to claim compensation, seek remediation, and mitigation of damages. To identify socio-environmental liabilities, interviews were conducted and environmental mining conflicts were analyzed. To estimate monetary values, data were linked to existing literature on costs associated with damages. Results show that the economic values of socio-environmental liabilities per ton of extracted and exported coal are higher than the market price of coal. The main socio-environmental liabilities arise from pollution, local health deterioration, water table depletion, land and ecosystem services losses, damages from transportation and shipping, and coal reserve loss. A comparison with studies in China and the United States indicates that values increase when other health impacts and climate change on a global scale are included. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB UN human rights organs have persistently invoked the integration of fundamental rights into the UNFCCC regime and the Paris Agreement now provides that the 'Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights'. How integration should be achieved is nevertheless a matter of international law development. At the regional level, a tendency seems to progressively emerge to ground integration in the fundamental right to a sustainable environment. Against such a background, it is argued in this article that a third generation environmental claim simplifies the complex establishment of a causal nexus between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and first and second generation fundamental rights. This would allow international human rights protection mechanisms to be triggered based on (minimum) reduction targets under the UNFCCC regime. The international recognition of a human right to a sustainable environment therefore emerges as fundamental to determining human rights responsibility for climate change, with particular regard to States. It thus facilitates systemically integrating fundamental rights into climate change regulation and taking consequential institutional action. This argument adds strings to the bow of those scholars who support the idea of intergenerational environmental justice on legal and moral grounds.

DT Article

AB The extraordinarily well-documented life of St. Kateri Tekakwitha and the "afterlives" of her physical remains are analyzed through the theoretical lens of a "political ecology of healing"-a framework emphasizing the interplay of ecosystems and decolonial praxis within historically colonized spaces. Investigating Indigenous political ecologies from the colonial archives of New France recovers the ways Native women maintained sovereign communities in their riverine homelands in an era of climate change, colonial invasion, and internecine violence during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Placing Indigenous women, their kinship networks, and their relationship with their ancestral lands at the center of decolonial history shows how Native communities along Kaniatarowanenneh-the St. Lawrence River-represented sites of Native resilience and regeneration rather than decline and dependence. Native women established a syncretistic religion devoted to Kateri's memory that mapped Catholic rituals on traditional Indigenous ecological knowledge and practices. This Indigenous spirituality remained distinct from the devotional cult European American colonizers erected around Kateri, and it persisted after settlers forgot her. After more than three centuries, Kateri's bones remain at Kahnawa:ke Mohawk Territory as a testimony to an unbroken history of Indigenous power, presence, and care for the land. Contemporary Indigenous movements for sovereignty, self-determination, and environmental justice have their origins in the political ecology of healing embodied by Kateri's bones.

AB This article explores the role of multi-level governance and power structures in local water security through a case study of the Nawalparasi district in Nepal. It focuses on economic sustainability as a measure to address water security, placing this thematic in the context of a complicated power structure consisting of local, district and national administration as well as external development cooperation actors. The study aims to find out whether efforts to improve the economic sustainability of water schemes have contributed to water security at the local level. In addition, it will consider the interactions between water security, power structures and local equality and justice. The research builds upon survey data from the Nepalese districts of Nawalparasi and Palpa, and a case study based on interviews and observation in Nawalparasi. The survey was performed in water schemes built within a Finnish development cooperation programme spanning from 1990 to 2004, allowing a consideration of the long-term sustainability of water management projects. This adds a crucial external influence into the intra-state power structures shaping water management in Nepal. The article thus provides an alternative perspective to cross-regional water security through a discussion combining transnational involvement with national and local points of view.

TI 'Fair' inequality, consumption and climate mitigation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; climate justice; energy consumption; fairness;
   inequality; meritocracy; poverty
AB Economic inequality and climate change are pressing issues that have climbed high up the political agenda, yet action to mitigate both remains slow. As income is a key determinant of ecological impacts, the Global North-and wealthier classes elsewhere-are the primary drivers of global carbon emissions, while the least well off have contributed the least yet are set to be hit hardest by climate impacts. These inequalities are clearly unjust, but the interrelations between economic inequality and ecological impacts are complex, leaving open the question of whether reducing the former would mitigate the latter, in the absence of reductions in total economic output. Here, we contribute to these debates by estimating the carbon-footprint implications of reducing income (and hence expenditure) inequalities within 32 countries of the Global North to the levels people consider to be fair; levels that are substantially smaller than currently exist. We find that realising these levels of economic inequality brings comparable reductions in carbon-footprint inequalities. However, in isolation, implementing fair inequalities has a negligible impact upon total emissions. In contrast, recomposing consumption-by reducing inequalities in household expenditure and the overall levels, then reallocating the reductions to public services-reduces carbon footprint by up to 30% in individual countries and 16% overall and, crucially, still allows the consumption of those at the bottom to rise. Such reductions could be significant on a global level, and they would be additional to the full range of conventional technological and demand-side measures to reduce carbon emissions.

   reflection on principles and prospects
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE

DT Review
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; EMISSIONS; POLICY
AB The Greenhouse Development Rights (GDRs) Framework is a proposal for a global climate agreement in which the obligations assigned to nations are based on a combination of responsibility (contribution to the problem) and capacity (ability to pay). A key feature of the GDRs framework is that it is modeled on the assignment of a right to development to individuals, such that individuals with incomes below a development threshold are nominally exempted from obligations to pay for mitigation and adaptation. Obligations for those over the threshold are calculated in the same way for rich persons in poor countries and rich persons in rich countries. As income distribution within countries is taken into account and all countries have some wealthy people, all countries have a positive obligation to contribute to global mitigation and adaptation requirements, eliminating the sharp distinction between Annex I and non-Annex I countries. In the last few years, GDRs has become one of the most widely known of the many so-called burden-sharing frameworks that have been proposed. In this essay, one of the co-authors of the GDRs framework presents the framework's fundamental principles, describes its place in the larger discussion of burden-sharing and climate justice, and reflects on its prospects in the next phase of the global climate negotiations. Hopefully it will be helpful both to readers new to GDRs and to our existing supporters and critics.

AB Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to climate change is an approach claimed to deliver social benefits relevant to marginalized groups. Based on a structured literature review, we interrogate such claims, asking whether such approaches may (or may not) contribute to social change and, more specifically, empowerment. We present a review of the predominant meaning and interlinkages of the EbA and empowerment concepts, which shows that EbA pays insufficient attention to issues of empowerment and agency. On this basis, we discuss how an empowerment lens could be (better) integrated into the conceptualization of EbA, suggesting key dimensions through which this could be supported. We show that the emphasis on empowerment theory and the merits that it brings to the EbA literature are helpful, leading to a number of important questions to adaptation projects on the ground. Incorporating an empowerment lens leads to an increased consideration of issues of power more broadly, especially the way marginalized groups' agency, access, and aspirations are conditioned by social structures that may prevent strategic adaptation choices. We conclude that EbA will facilitate empowerment better by explicitly considering how social benefits can emerge from the interplay between particular types of actions, marginalized people's adaptive strategies, and their relational context.

AB To date, review articles examining stream daylighting (de-culverting buried streams) are limited in scope, report on only a fraction of available publications, and focus on publications' explicit (manifest) content rather than their underlying constructs (latent content). This review combines the methods of systematic literature reviews and inductive content analysis to better understand the scope and nature of the literature on stream daylighting. The study investigates four themes: the disciplines, terminologies, definitions, and case studies and their interconnections and covers all relevant English-language sources since 1992 through 2018. The results reveal three findings with implications for future research: 1) there is a dearth in studies that tackle crucial contemporary challenges like climate change and studies that delve into the complex connections among the sociocultural, physical planning, environmental, and economic dimensions of stream daylighting, such as socio-environmental justice, architecture, and urban design; 2) the terminology is inconsistent and a clear definition is absent; 3) Some important stream daylighting cases are overlooked, such as Ziirich's (Switzerland) city-wide initiative and Riyadh's (Saudi Arabia) first arid climate initiative. The inclusion of such case studies in the literature impacts the perception of stream daylighting and expands the scope and dimensions of this practice.

AB Most large-scale studies exploring the relationship between natural resources or climate change and conflict have looked at how environmental factors lead to conflict. This paper reverses that causal arrow and presents an exploratory large-Nstudy of 187 countries from 1962 to 2009 assessing the long-term impact of violent conflicts on their environment. I also look at how this relationship is affected by economic and political factors. I use national biocapacity data calculated by the Global Footprint Network as a measure of environmental resources. The results indicate that in the long run, the impact of conflicts on a country's biocapacity is mediated by wealth and democratization. I find that both wealth and democratization are necessary to mitigate the environmental impact of wars. I also find that countries with high levels of democratization and low per capita GDP and countries with low levels of democratization and high per capita GDP experience a decline in their biocapacity in the long run as the intensity of conflict increases. These findings underscore how advanced, industrialized democracies export the environmental risk of wars onto other countries, which has implications for environmental security and international environmental justice.

Based on a comprehensive review of the literature (n = 686 studies), we present the current state of knowledge on: 1) the exposure and vulnerability of IPs to pollution; 2) the environmental, health, and cultural impacts of pollution upon IPs; and 3) IPs' contributions to prevent, control, limit, and abate pollution from local to global scales. Indigenous peoples experience large burdens of environmental pollution linked to the expansion of commodity frontiers and industrial development, including agricultural, mining, and extractive industries, as well as urban growth, waste dumping, and infrastructure and energy development. Nevertheless, IPs are contributing to limit pollution in different ways, including through environmental monitoring and global policy advocacy, as well as through local resistance toward polluting activities. This work adds to growing evidence of the breadth and depth of environmental injustices faced by IPs worldwide, and we conclude by highlighting the need to increase IPs' engagement in environmental decision-making regarding pollution control.

SO URBANI IZZIV-URBAN CHALLENGE
LA English

   gentrification
AB The Gowanus neighbourhood, like many other New York City waterfronts, is facing a crossroads: how to promote development in a polluted landscape vulnerable to climate-induced sea-level rise that is inhabited by low-income populations and coveted by wealthy new arrivals for its waterfront property? For many years, toxic contamination and a combined sewer overflow problem inhibited new development in the neighbourhood. But in recent years, particularly beginning in 2010, after the Environmental Protection Agency designated the Canal and surrounding areas a Superfund site targeted for clean-up, developers have sought to shed Gowanus's industrial identity and recast it as a prime up-and-coming residential locale. Although the community celebrates environmental restoration and protection, there is also a sense of foreboding that clean-up is paving the way for high-end development projects. This article charts the progress of neoliberal urban development in Gowanus through the lens of critical urban theory, identifying stakeholders and power dynamics. It looks at rezoning/revitalization as a tool of the municipality to transform an industrial business zone and low-income neighbourhood, ostensibly to foster development and cope with climate change and sea-level rise, but, in fact, cultivates socio-political exclusion and gentrification while ignoring concerns over the long-term environmental viability of new development.

AB The population living in large urban areas faces multiple pressures on their physical and psychological well-being coming from various polluting sources: air pollution, water pollution, and high noise level, thermal and visual stress. Urban green spaces have a positive impact on human health, as they help people relax more. Stress relief through physical exercise and social interaction is possible by having an increased access to parks or other green areas. As in the case of many growing cities, Craiova faces a continuous demand for more construction development space, while the shrinkage of urban green areas is becoming an issue. Using a GIS-based method, this study analyses the accessibility of Craiova residents to urban green spaces, identifying the areas with reduced green spaces and making recommendations for the improvement of the green areas available to residents. The number and location of the parks in the city are correlated with the population density within residential areas in order to analyse the accessibility to green areas based on both walking and driving distance between the access points of the green spaces and the residential areas. Data indicate an unevenly distribution of parks and access to green areas.

AB With growing urban populations and climate change, urban flooding is an important global issue, even in dryland regions. Flood risk assessments are usually used to identify vulnerable locations and populations, flooding experience patterns, or levels of concern about flooding, but rarely are all of these approaches combined. Furthermore, the social dynamics of flood concerns, exposure, and experience are underexplored. We combined geographic and survey data on household-level measures of flood experience, concern, and exposure in Utah's urbanizing Wasatch Front. We asked: (1) Are socially vulnerable groups more likely to be exposed to flood risk? (2) How common are flooding experiences among urban residents, and how are these experiences related to sociodemographic characteristics and exposure? and (3) How concerned are urban residents about flooding, and does concern vary by exposure, flood experience, and sociodemographic characteristics? Although floodplain residents were more likely to be White and have higher incomes, respondents who were of a racial/ethnic minority, were older, had less education, and were living in floodplains were more likely to report flood experiences and concern about flooding. Flood risk management approaches need to address social as well as physical sources of vulnerability to floods and recognize social sources of variation in flood experiences and concern.

AB Centring on landscape, considerable social tension persists around siting windfarms in Wales. While the policy of both Wales and UK governments commits them to cutting carbon emissions to mitigate climate change and so to increasing the percentage of electricity derived from renewable energy sources, political support for windfarms vacillates and there is vociferous public opposition. Taking landscape as our organising concept, we analyse the 62 turbine, approximately 155 Megawatt Nant y Moch proposal in Ceredigion. We ask how landscape is represented in pro and anti-windfarm discourses and how reconsideration of landscape might lead to alternative constructions of justice. We thus develop a notion of 'landscape justice' which blends elements of deontological, virtue and consequentialist ethics, and argue for: (i) a deeper appreciation of the exclusion of 'other' voices in deciding outcomes; (ii) a heightened awareness that how public space is created and how arguments are made, received and facilitated therein is critically important to just outcomes; (iii) a renewed interest in how landscape, wind and energy ought to be valued; (iv) an understanding that, although justice with respect to landscape may be irresolvable across space and time, that arguments may be incommensurable, this pluralistic limit can be celebrated.

AB Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is being proclaimed as "a new direction in forest conservation" (Anglesen, 2009: 125). This financial incentives-based climate change mitigation strategy proposed by the UNEP, World Bank, GEF and environmental NGOs seeks to integrate forests into carbon sequestration schemes. Its proponents view REDD+ as part of an adaptive strategy to counter the effects of global climate change. This paper combines the theoretical approaches of market environmentalism and environmental narratives to examine the politics of environmental knowledge that are redefining socio-nature relations in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania to make mangrove forests amenable to markets. Through a case study of a "REDD-readiness" climate change mitigation and adaptation project, we demonstrate how a shift in resource control and management from local to global actors builds upon narratives of environmental change (forest loss) that have little factual basis in environmental histories. We argue that the proponents of REDD+ (Tanzanian state, aid donors, environmental NGOs) underestimate the agency of forest-reliant communities who have played a major role in the making of the delta landscape and who will certainly resist the injustices they are facing as a result of this shift from community-based resource management to fortress conservation.

AB Recent work has suggested that our cognitive biases and moral psychology may pose significant barriers to tackling climate change. Here, we report evidence that through status and group-based social influence processes, and our moral sense of justice, it may be possible to employ such characteristics of the human mind in efforts to engender pro-environmental action. We draw on applied work demonstrating the efficacy of social modeling techniques in order to examine the indirect effects of social model status and group membership (through perceptions of efficacy, pro-environmental social identity and moral judgments of how fair it is for individuals to perform particular pro-environmental actions) on pro-environmental action tendencies. We find evidence that high- (vs. low-) status models increase pro-environmental action, in part, through making such actions seem morally fairer to undertake. This effect of high-status models only occurs when they share a meaningful ingroup membership with the target of influence. Further, we find evidence that this conditional effect of high-status models may also have a direct impact on action tendencies. While the exact behaviors that are influenced may vary across student and non-student samples, we argue that a focus on the justice pathway to action and the social-cognitive features of models may offer a good opportunity for cognitive and behavioral scientists to integrate insights from basic research with those stemming from more applied research efforts.

AB What are the guiding principles of contemporary international governance of climate change and to what extent do they represent neoliberal forms? We document five main political and institutional shifts within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and outline core governance practices for each phase. In discussing the current phase since the Paris Agreement, we offer to the emerging literature on international neoliberal environmental governance an analytical framework by which the extent of international neoliberal governance can be assessed. We conceptualize international neoliberal environmentalism as characterized by four main processes: the prominence of libertarian ideals of justice, in which justice is defined as the rational pursuit of sovereign self-interest between unequal parties; marketization, in which market mechanisms, private sector engagement and purportedly 'objective' considerations are viewed as the most effective and efficient forms of governance; governance by disclosure, in which the primary obstacles to sustainability are understood as 'imperfect information' and onerous regulatory structures that inhibit innovation; and exclusivity, in which multilateral decision-making is shifted from consensus to minilateralism. Against this framework, we argue that the contemporary UNFCCC regime has institutionalized neoliberal reforms in climate governance, although not without resistance, in a configuration which is starkly different than that of earlier eras. We conclude by describing four crucial gaps left by this transition, which include the ability of the regime to drive adequate ambition, and gaps in transparency, equity and representation.

AB Climate change is borderless, and its impacts are not shared equally by all communities. It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives. This article seeks to contribute to the emerging policies of preserving intangible heritage in the context of climate displacement.

   Climate Change

AB Indigenous communities in the Arctic are facing some of the most severe consequences of the world's inaction on climate change. Although these communities are often portrayed as the faces of climate change, their voices are rarely heard in climate-related decision-making. This article examines how Indigenous communities in the Canadian Arctic can ensure their inclusion in climate change related governance. In particular, this article analyzes whether the Crown owes a duty to consult and accommodate to Indigenous communities in the Arctic, whose rights recognized and protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 are adversely affected by the impacts of climate change, when contemplating action that would increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus further contribute to global climate change. This article concludes that the duty to consult and accommodate could likely be triggered in this context, though there are certainly obstacles. Triggering the duty to consult and accommodate in the context of climate change is largely dependent on identifying Crown "conduct." The author puts forward three potential ways to satisfy the Crown "conduct" prong of the Haida Nation test, namely: (i) a single contemplated action/decision that will increase GHG emissions; (ii) a constellation of decisions/actions that will increase GHG emissions and; (iii) regulations or executive policies that will increase GHG emissions. In sum, as climate litigation has emerged around the world, and recently in Canada, this article seeks to engage in a larger discussion as to whether Canadian law has the capacity to advance climate justice.

AB Divestment is a climate change initiative that aims to persuade institutions, businesses, and governments to remove their financial investments from fossil fuel industries and instead invest in zero-carbon climate solutions. It has, however, also been conceived as an ongoing gateway tactic to curb long-term climate change and simultaneously secure social and environmental justice. Divestment has attracted global attention and is currently employed by numerous universities, religious institutions, art galleries, museums, and national and local governments, in various countries, including Scotland. However academic analysis of the movement remains underdeveloped. This article addresses such absence by giving a voice to the motives, tactics, and rationales as expressed by campaigners themselves. It identifies the collective action frames constructed by Scottish fossil fuel divestment campaigns in order to facilitate mobilisation and alignment with other climate change movements. A key premise of this article is to also explore the power of such frames to motivate action and to assess the extent to which divestment campaign groups can impact government discourse and policy. As such the article concludes by considering whether and how far divestment frames and discourses may have come to inform the climate change policy of the devolved Scottish Government.

AB South African cities have focused on sustainability as a policy and strategic objective. Nonetheless, realising the transformative potential of fostering sustainable transition pathways is challenging. Our entry point for understanding this impasse is that the ability of cities to transform lies in the opaque spaces between policy rhetoric and implementation. We unpack these policy disjunctures in two ways. Firstly, we posit that the potential of the City to ensure that policy based on progressive and transformative principles is implemented in ways that foster the intended action is tied up with its ability to perform as a learning institution. The transformative role of learning is in turn dependent on accessing the situated tacit knowledge that informs decision-making and action. Secondly, we propose that researching the capacity of the City to learn requires alternative spaces for research and deliberation. To illustrate these arguments, we draw on a knowledge co-production urban experiment in Cape Town to improve the efficacy and analysis of both policy development and implementation. Tacit knowledge surfaced practices that are found to hamper learning within the City. Engaging with identified barriers to learning and change provides alternate entry points for identifying feasible points of leverage to address sustainability disjunctures.

ID DEBT; EMISSIONS; BURDENS; DEFENSE; JUSTICE; COMMON
AB In this paper I discuss a popular position in the climate justice literature concerning historical accountability for climate change. According to this view, historical high-emitters of greenhouse gases-or currently existing individuals that are appropriately related to them-are in possession of some form of emission debt, owed to certain of those who are now burdened by climate change. It is frequently claimed that such debts were originally incurred by historical emissions that violated a principle of fair shares for the world's natural resources. Thus, a suitable principle of natural resource justice is required to render this interpretation of historical accountability complete. I argue that the need for such a principle poses a significant challenge for the historical emission debt view, because there doesn't appear to be any determinate answer to the question what a fair share of climate sink capacity would have been historically. This leaves the historical emission debt view incomplete and thus unable to explain a powerful intuition that appears to motivate the view: namely, that there is something unjust about how the climate sink has historically been used. I suggest an alternative explanation of this common intuition according to which historically unequal consumption of climate sink capacity, whether or not wrongful in and of itself, is a symptom of broader global injustice concerning control over and access to the world's natural resources. This broader historical injustice will be harder to quantify and harder to repair than that which the historical emission debt purports to identify.

AB The global urban population is increasing and in many urban areas this, combined with densification, create a strain on urban water management and availability of urban green space. Simultaneously, climate change leads to increased frequency and intensity of cloudbursts and hot spells. To counteract experienced problems, cities are increasingly working to improve urban green space through actively including nature-based solutions (NBS) and their related ecosystem services (ES). From an urban sustainable development perspective, it is important to understand where and how to work with NBS and ES, to benefit the whole society. This task of urban ES governance is challenging, especially as the possibilities to work with green space depend on the amount of available space, which varies greatly in and between cities. The aim of the study was to assess how local stakeholders involved in urban development and regeneration processes in a neighbourhood perceive the physical/environmental and social structures, and their interactions in relation to ES provision. The study focuses on actors that directly or indirectly influence the wellbeing of local residents in the district Sofielund in Malmo, Sweden, and is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 stakeholders, including property owners or managers, businesses and local representatives from the Swedish Union of Tenants.
   The results show that local stakeholder involvement is a key to a just urban ES governance. Without acknowledging different stakeholder perspectives, there is a risk that those with more power and louder voices may steer the urban development in a certain direction, leaving the rest devoid of influence. Approaches to involve local residents exist in Sofielund, both within the local community, housing organizations, as well as a part of the ordinary planning process, but several barriers exist for a more structured participatory culture where the interest of local residents are taken into consideration. Particularly relevant for the interviewed stakeholders, is the identified lack of structure for participation and communication between property owners and the municipality. If the distribution of ES is unequal and participatory structures are lacking, stakeholders will perceive that their interests are not considered. In a short-term perspective, this will create unsatisfaction and decreased trust. In the longer perspective, it may create a degradation of the neighbourhood where economically stronger inhabitants move out. By ensuring, that local inhabitants perceive that their needs of green space are recognized and that a potential uneven distributions of ES provision is considered, it is possible to achieve a more just sustainable urban development. Based on these findings, we make four recommendations on how a just urban ES governance could be developed; social and physical development has to be seen as a whole, power structures have to be recognized, inclusive engagement structures have to be put in place, measurements of ES have to target relative ES provision, related to the needs of differet groups of residents groups.

ID WIND; VULNERABILITY; RESOURCES; IMPACTS
AB Much of the academic literature and policy discussions about sustainable development and climate change adaptation focus on poor and developing nations, yet many tribal communities inside the United States include marginalized peoples and developing nations who face structural barriers to effectively adapt to climate change. There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in the United States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the Big Horn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture, which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream. Therefore, building capacity to take control of land and water resources and preparing for climate change and drought at Wind River Reservation is of critical importance.

AB Whether pessimistic believing that overpopulation is the ultimate cause of many environmental problems or optimistic arguing for social justice and technological development, studying human population dynamics and their impacts on the environment is an important and ongoing field of study. This type of research should take advantage of the many benefits offered by indirect remote sensing, geographic information systems, and other related disciplines data that are based on relationships developed at the field. Nevertheless, many facets of the subject including the relationship between human population distribution (HPD) and land surface temperature (LST) in areas that have different climatic classifications are still lacking attention. Hence, this study focused on bridging this gap in order to provide supporting scientific evidence for planners and decision makers all over the globe. Four areas that represent the four main populated climate zones were randomly selected. They are: (1) ElSalvador for equatorial climate, (2) Kuwait for arid climate, (3) Lebanon for warm temperate climate, and (4) New Hampshire for boreal climate. For the years 2001, 2009, and 2017 for the four areas, HPD data were obtained from LandScan project while LST data were derived from MOD11C3 product. An integrated framework approach was implemented. This approach included: (1) basic descriptive non-spatial statistics, (2) spatial Global Moran's I Index and Anselin Local Moran's I Index, (3) non-spatial Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and (4) spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM) regressions. It has been observed that the strength and direction of the relationship between HPD and LST do not vary from time to time but vary from climate zone to another. The strongest relationship can be found in boreal climates, followed by warm temperate climates, and then arid and equatorial climates. In boreal, warm temperate, and equatorial climates the relationship is positive while in arid climates the relationship is negative providing indirect supporting evidence for the inversion of surface urban heat islands phenomenon in arid climates. Furthermore, it has been noticed that the relationship between HPD and LST is highly spatially dependent regardless the time and climate zone where some type of spatial diffusion or spillover processes might be present. Still, it is clear that this relationship is complex and not amenable to direct explanation and needs further investigation in order to be explained.

AB Managed retreat is increasingly advocated as a means to promote resilience and adaptation to climate change. However, there are various uncertainties and challenges associated with the impacts of displacement and attachments to place. In this context, it is useful to study past examples of relocation to understand how these challenges have been addressed. This paper draws on a case study relocation scheme which took place in Ireland following major flooding in 1954. This represented a radical and comprehensive approach to relocation which sought to address the root causes of vulnerability. The analysis shows that this comprehensive approach was made possible through a connection between managed retreat and land reform. The scheme also faced opposition linked to attachments to place and property. This led to compromises and a failure to fully address the effects of flooding on livelihoods but contributed to resilience through ensuring that family and community ties remained intact. The paper's distinctive contributions are its analysis of the requirements of transformative approaches to adaptation and relocation, its identification of challenges associated with place and property even in the context of such transformative approaches, and its adding of historical depth to contemporary debates on climate adaptation.

AB Planned resettlement is being widely considered as a response to the impacts of climate change. As many millions of people are expected to be displaced in the coming decades, scholars and policymakers are searching for precedence to inform their research and planning, particularly from experiences of Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement (DIDR). Nowhere in the world is DIDR and other closely related forms of planned resettlement more prevalent than in China: an estimated 78 million people have been displaced by development projects over the last six decades. While planned resettlement has consistently been shown to cause impoverishment, the Chinese state views it as the answer to a multitude of social ills including poverty, environmental damage, low levels of domestic consumption, and most recently, climate change, providing impetus to the normalisation of resettlement as adaptation. This paper examines the prospects for just outcomes in resettlement projects by examining distributive justice at multiple scales in existing resettlement practice in China. It finds that due to the interplay between resettlement and questions of procedural justice, prospects for just outcomes are quite limited, and that in order to achieve fair adaptation, alternatives to planned resettlement should be emphasised.

TI Social Work Supervision An Exploration of the Current Challenges in a
   Rapidly Changing Social, Economic and Political Environment
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK

DT Article
DE critical social work; new economy; social change; social justice; social
   work supervision; workplace learning
AB This article identifies important challenges facing social work supervision as a result of the social, political and economic changes that have characterized the last two decades in most Western countries. In response a re-positioning of the critical tradition in the scholarship and practice of social work has been proffered by several authors (for example, Allan et al., 2003; Dominelli, 2002) as a means of addressing and counteracting the more negative challenges facing social work emanating from these changes. We argue that this critical re-positioning can also be applied to similar challenges facing practice supervision.
   Findings: As the social work landscape has to contend with a more conservative and fiscally restrictive environment, so too has practice supervision become more focused on efficiency, accountability and worker performance often at the expense of professional and practice development. In addition, current research has identified a crisis in the probity of practice supervision where many practitioners cite disillusionment and despair, as well as lack of opportunity to stop and critically reflect on practice situations as another challenge in this changed climate.
   Application: As a significant site of practice, a critically informed supervision praxis has the potential to emerge as a site for modelling social change strategies associated with the critical social work tradition.

AB Scientific evidence accumulating over the past decade documents that climate change impacts are already being experienced in the US Northeast. Policy-makers and resource managers must now prepare for the impacts from climate change and support implementing such plans on the ground. In this paper we argue that climate change challenges the region to maintain its economic viability, but also holds some opportunities that may enhance economic development, human well-being, and social justice. To face these challenges and seize these opportunities effectively we must better understand adaptation capacities, opportunities and constraints, the social processes of adaptation, approaches for engaging critical players and the broader public in informed debate, decision-making, and conscious interventions in the adaptation process. This paper offers a preliminary qualitative assessment, in which we emphasize the need for (1) assessing the feasibility and side effects of technological adaptation options, (2) increasing available resources and improving equitable access to them, (3) increasing institutional flexibility, fit, cooperation and decision-making authority, (4) using and enhancing human and social capital, (5) improving access to insurance and other risk-spreading mechanisms, and (6) linking scientific information more effectively to decision-makers while engaging the public. Throughout, we explore these issues through illustrative sectoral examples. We conclude with a number of principles that may guide the preparation of future adaptation plans for the Northeast.

AB In this paper we discuss the importance of framing the question of public acceptance of sustainable energy transitions in terms of values and a 'whole-system' lens. This assertion is based on findings arising from a major research project examining public values, attitudes and acceptability with regards to whole energy system change using a mixed-method (six deliberative workshops, n=68, and a nationally representative survey, n = 2441), interdisciplinary approach. Through the research we identify a set of social values associated with desirable energy futures in the UK, where the values represent identifiable cultural resources people draw on to guide their preference formation about particular aspects of energy system change. As such, we characterise public perspectives as being underpinned by six value clusters relating to efficiency and wastefulness, environment and nature, security and stability, social justice and fairness, autonomy and power, and processes and change. We argue that this 'value system' provides a basis for understanding core reasons for public acceptance or rejection of different energy system aspects and processes. We conclude that a focus on values that underpin more specific preferences for energy system change brings insights that could provide a basis for improved dialogue, more robust decision-making, and for anticipating likely points of conflict in energy transitions.

TI Why did "operation cremate monsanto" fail? Science and class in India's
   great terminator-technology hoax
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID BT-COTTON
AB Though promoted by the Government of India, and endorsed by dominant international organizations concerned with agriculture, biotechnology has produced fierce resistance and divisions. "Operation Cremate Monsanto" combined nationalist appeals, opposition to multinational capital, and rejection of genetic engineering in one integrated critique. The movement failed; Monsanto's technology spread rapidly and widely in India. The movement illustrated a larger problematic of understanding interests under conditions of rapid and complex technological change. Science continually presents new challenges to the way interests are understood by citizens and political classes that control states; the sea change in redefinitions of interests-of both individuals and states-introduced by, for example, the atmospheric science of ozone holes and climate change is archetypal, as are the internationally contentious battles in trade and property of "genetically modified organisms." Interests in biotechnology are screened by science, understandings of which are unevenly distributed. Asymmetries of knowledge and skill repertory necessary for participation in global networks of contestation create new class positions within India, and corresponding contradictions in social movements. Cultural capital matters fundamentally in differentiating classes and class interests; authenticity rents become available to some class positions but not others. Divisions matter because movements seeking environmental integrity and social justice may ultimately be weakened by egregious inaccuracies of framing, however effective the short-terms gains in dramaturgy may be.

AB Understanding why and where decision-makers choose to use different climate change adaptation strategies remains an important theoretical and practical question for coastal adaptation. This article provides an exploratory statistical analysis of three adaptation measures (shoreline armoring, property acquisitions, and beach nourishment) and their deployment with respect to metrics of risk exposure, socioeconomic markers, and critical infrastructure in North Carolina (U.S.). This exploratory analysis evaluates two propositions. First, adaptation measures are deployed relative to specific metrics of risk. Second, adaptation choice disproportionately correlates with socioeconomic attributes. The findings support both propositions and reveal that shoreline armoring correlates with higher home values, household incomes, and population density and low racial diversity. Property acquisitions are found to correlate with low home values, household incomes, and population density and high racial diversity. Furthermore, adaptation measures are interconnected. Acquisitions are more likely to occur in areas with low levels of armoring. Beach nourishment occurs exclusively in areas with shoreline armoring. The results find no correlation of adaptation deployment with critical infrastructure. This article provides the foundation for future research into how adaptation decisions are made and trade-offs among adaptation actions considered, whether decisions adequately protect critical infrastructure, and how deployment patterns affect social equity.

AB The provision of community-based child welfare services (CCW) in a managerialist climate in Aotearoa New Zealand (ANZ) necessitates constantly renegotiated contractual partnerships, service targeting and measured outcomes. Reflective supervision is essential to counter the perceived negative impacts of managerialism on CCW work. Within this environment, there is a struggle to ensure supervision provides reflective spaces for social workers to develop in their work with service users despite the demands of meeting organisational imperatives. This article reports on a qualitative study which critically analyses the espoused theory and theories-in-use [Argyris, C., & Schon, D. (1974). Theory in practice: Increasing professional effectiveness. San Francisco, CA: Jossey Bass.] about reflective supervision held by social workers practising in the demanding environment of CCW. In the first phase of the research reported here, nine key informants who had both considerable experience in CCW and academic experience in ANZ were interviewed about the nature of reflective supervision in CCW social work. Findings indicate that social workers working in CCW settings are influenced by factors associated with self-awareness, relationships, organisational and professional obligations within a changing and risk-averse managerial environment. Key informants assert that social workers from CCW backgrounds need reflective supervision to engage in self-reflection, consider wider socio-cultural factors and to critically develop social-justice-informed practice with service users.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the development of educational leadership, administration and management (EdLAM) research by identifying thematic strands that hallmark key publications and synthesise major research findings and limitations. Design/methodology/approach This study combines bibliometric and content analysis methods to review 2,347 publications from 15 core EdLAM journals published from 2007 to 2016. Findings The bibliometric analysis identified five EdLAM thematic strands: school leadership for enhancing students' academic achievement and teachers' effectiveness; leadership for educational change, accountability and promoting democratic values; leadership for social justice, equal education and narrowing achievement gaps; principal's instructional leadership for school improvement; and distributed leadership and its impact on organisational climate and teachers' attitudes and stress. The content analysis revealed that the EdLAM research from 2007 to 2016 further developed the following research areas: the dynamics between leaders and teachers in leadership work, the potential risks of distributed leadership and the EdLAM challenges brought by the New Public Management and neoliberalism. Originality/value This study depicts state-of-the-art EdLAM research. It confirms the combination of bibliometric and content analyses as a useful approach for large-scale review studies. Finally, this review suggests future research directions.

AB Resilience building has become a growing policy agenda, particularly for urban risk management. While much of the resilience agenda has been shaped by policies and discourses from the global North, its applicability for cities of the global South, particularly African cities, has not been sufficiently assessed. Focusing on rights of urban citizens as the object to be made resilient, rather than physical and ecological infrastructures, may help to address many of the root causes that characterize the unacceptable risks that urban residents face on a daily basis. Linked to this idea, we discuss four entry points for grounding a rights and justice orientation for urban resilience. First, notions of resilience must move away from narrow, financially oriented risk analyses. Second, opportunities must be created for negotiated resilience, to allow for attention to processes that support these goals, as well as for the integration of diverse interests. Third, achieving resilience in ways that do justice to the local realities of diverse urban contexts necessitates taking into account endogenous, locally situated processes, knowledges and norms. And finally, urban resilience needs to be placed within the context of global systems, providing an opportunity for African contributions to help reimagine the role that cities might play in these global financial, political and science processes.

AB Social opposition to renewable energy (RE) projects has become a significant issue both for the deployment of RE technologies and the social justice of this process. However, the policy tools oriented to address this issue have received little research attention, particularly in the Global South. Thus, this research analyses the effectiveness of the social impact assessment (SIA) in Mexico's RE sector. In 2014 the government of Mexico introduced the SIA in response to the social conflicts around RE projects. The SIA has generated some favorable changes in the sector's social management. Yet, its effectiveness is constrained by diverse issues related to its institutional and regulatory design, government implementation, practices of companies and consultants, and restricted social involvement. Moreover, the sector's socio-technical arrangement (priorities, organization, experience, and policies) strongly influences the performance of SIAs and accounts for the lack of consideration of social aspects in project design and planning. We argue that without a substantial internalization of the social dimension in the priorities, policy, and planning of RE, the SIA would be limited to a problem-fixing role, which would constrain the effective management of social impacts.

AB Climate-compatible development (CCD) is being operationalised across the developing world through projects that integrate development, adaptation and mitigation using community-based approaches-community-based CCD (CB-CCD). By incorporating and considering local people's concerns, these projects are positioned as more effective, efficient and sustainable than 'top-down' climate and development solutions. However, the literature pays little attention to whether and how these projects achieve procedural justice by recognising local people's identities, cultures and values; and providing local people with meaningful participatory opportunities. We address this gap through an analysis of two donor-funded CB-CCD projects in Malawi, drawing on household surveys, semi-structured interviews and documentary materials. Our findings show that the projects had only limited success in facilitating procedural justice for the target populations. Households' meaningful engagement in project activities and decision-making was often curtailed because power asymmetries went unchallenged. While many households were well engaged in projects, the recognition and participation of others-including many of the most vulnerable households-was limited. Building on our findings, we present a six-step approach to help CB-CCD project staff understand, manage and challenge power asymmetries; and create widespread recognition of, and meaningful participatory opportunities for, local people.

TI Geographers declare (a climate emergency)?
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
LA English

DE Climate emergency; biodiversity; emergency declaration; climate change;
   bushfire; geography
AB Over the last two decades 'climate emergency' has grown from a little-known term to a mainstream public issue. In Australia, the term gained traction during the 2019-2020 'Black Summer' bushfires. The (un)natural disaster prompted local governments, industries, peak bodies and academic collectives to 'declare' a climate emergency and call for immediate action on climate change. We note, however, that there has been no declaration from geographers in Australia. As a discipline whose members are embedded in research, teaching and advocacy about climate change - and the interlinked crises of biodiversity loss and environmental and social justice - we found this surprising. It is self-evident that climate change matters to geographers. So, is a declaration of a climate emergency from the discipline necessary? In writing this piece we reflect on our experiences of the 2019-2020 summer and conversations with fellow geographers, to consider what a declaration of an emergency does, who it is for and what actions it might mobilise. In conclusion, we call on geographers in Australia to declare an emergency which foregrounds the interlinked crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and social (in)justice. The detail of what this declaration says and means in practice is open for discussion. We ask many questions throughout this paper as a way to invite you - our fellow geographers - to join us in this conversation.

ID CAPE-TOWN; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; LESSONS; TRENDS; MODEL
AB The interruption of essential water services in Cape Town, foreshadowed as 'Day Zero,' is one of several recent examples of urban water scarcity connected to the language of urgent climate change. Johannesburg, with its larger and growing population and deeply enmeshed water and power infrastructures, is currently regarded as one drought away from disaster. As a result, the lessons to be learned from Cape Town are under active debate in South Africa. We used Q method to examine the structure of perspectives on urban water scarcity among South African water management practitioners. Our results illustrate distinct viewpoints differentiated by focus on corruption and politics, supply and demand systems, and social justice concerns as well as a distinct cohort of pragmatic optimists. Our analysis underscores the significance of public trust and institutional effectiveness, regardless of otherwise sound policy or infrastructure tools. As practitioners explicitly connect domains of competency to solvable and critical problems, integrated systems approaches will require deliberate interventions. Furthermore, urban water crises exacerbate and are exacerbated by existing experiences of racial and economic inequality, but this effect is masked by focus on demand management of average per capita water consumption and characterization of water scarcity as 'the new normal.'

AB We present a survey of 85 people involved in climate change education and mitigation, mainly in the UK, exploring the significant life experiences (SLEs) and formative influences that have contributed to their concern about climate change and their interest in climate change education and mitigation. In contrast with the findings of a large number of previous studies of environmentalists/environmental educators, outdoor experiences during childhood were not generally a major formative influence on the respondents. Although Western children nowadays commonly have fewer opportunities to enjoy such experiences, analysis showed that the differences were not due simply to changes over time. Uniquely in research on SLEs of environmentalists/environmental educators, we also examined respondents' values and motivations, to further understand what inspires action. Social justice concerns were rated as more motivating than biospheric concerns by the sample as a whole, and altruistic and biospheric values were considered equally important as guiding principles. These findings have implications for the framing of climate change as an 'environmental' problem, and suggest that, contrary to conclusions that may have been drawn from past research, environmental education specifically directed towards stimulating engagement with climate change need not entail promoting outdoor experiences, nature connectedness, or biospheric values and motivations for action.

ID MANAGED RETREAT; POLICY; PERSPECTIVES; ACQUISITION; RELOCATION
AB Voluntary home buyout programs have gained increasing popularity as a natural hazard mitigation tool over the past couple decades. However, a strong emphasis on the monetary value of disaster mitigation leaves open the possibility of inequity in distribution of the benefits of buyouts that may exacerbate social justice issues under conditions of increasing disaster damages due to climate change. Using a complete dataset of U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funded buyout properties we describe the demographic makeup of neighborhoods and counties that have participated in FEMA buyout programs since the 1980s and evaluate differential disadvantages in the chances of receiving a buyout and the amount of money received by buyout participants across characteristics associated with social vulnerability. We find that urban counties with greater resources are more likely to receive funds to administer a buyout program, and that within these counties, minority homeowners are less likely to receive federal aid dollars. In addition, we identify a trend of increasing disparity specifically for Black populations. Our findings suggest that intended objectivity in how voluntary buyout dollars are distributed has led to unintentional inequities at multiple scales that may become more pronounced without changes to existing policy and highlight the growing need for social equity consideration in strategic retreat planning.

AB The roles of principal leadership in change management have long been documented. The key concern to examine in this study was the dilemmas and measures confronting principals' when they led changes to instigate inclusive education in Hong Kong. Thus, this paper aims to report sources of dilemmas and how principals tackled them in the change process. Ten principals of schools recognized for effective inclusive education practices were interviewed in a qualitative study. Findings suggested that the process of leading change was very complex. Two dilemmas were identified: (a) principals' struggles between benefits and issues of participating in inclusive education and (b) autocratic initial decisions versus need for staff involvement. The second dilemma stemmed from not involving key staff while the implementation required their active participation. Thus, the existing organizational culture and personnel capacities became obstacles required for the success of inclusive education. The leadership measures to tackle the obstacles began by building a shared vision which in turn required both transactional and transformational leadership activities in order to increase teacher commitment to reforms. This study has contributed to change leadership theories in affirming the need to include socio-political contexts in examining leadership decisions toward school reforms.

DE values; Q methodology; climate change; adaptation policy; Ebro Delta
ID DISCOURSES; POLITICS
AB Outcome and context-focused approaches to climate change adaptation dominate the relevant literature. Taking into account values and perceptions of affected actors and decision-makers is a fundamental and necessary prerequisite for a more effective, legitimate and fair climate policy and has not been given the necessary consideration. This paper uses Q methodology to explore such values in the context of climate change in the Ebro Delta, in Catalonia. The delta is an area highly vulnerable to climate change, mainly because of its topography, but also as a result of human intervention. The study identifies five discourses on vulnerability and adaptation held by delta inhabitants and decision-makers. Social justice and security comprise shared values behind arguments; however, discourses differ in their approaches concerning the proper scale for applying these values with adaptation policy. Our results serve to improve policy dialogue and suggest that the adaptation policy agenda should focus on pursuing consensus over the crucial issue of scale. Our use of Q methodology to advance the incipient literature on value-based climate change vulnerability and adaptation is innovative and suggests that the approach has a capacity to contribute to advancing deliberative environmental decision-making on adaptation.

ID RESERVE
AB Community-based forest management (CBFM) is the principal strategy in managing inhabited 'forest land' in the Philippines. It involves the participation of local communities in various forestry activities to achieve sustainable forestry, advance social justice and improve socioeconomic welfare, and promote a stable and healthy environment. This paper analyses the potential benefits of agroforestry farms in CBFM sites to mitigate climate change. The incorporation of trees in farms and landscapes has led to enhanced carbon storage and sequestration. Half a million hectares of agroforestry farms in CBFM sites in the Philippines are estimated to store 25 MtC while sequestering 2.7 MtC annually. Lessons are drawn from three carbon sequestration projects under development using CBFM as the main approach. Income from carbon credits is not sufficient to recover the cost of tree planting. The transaction costs of forestry CDM projects are substantial and could prove to be the greatest barrier to project fruition. Government institutions must find ways to encourage project developers by simplifying rules and regulations for forestry carbon projects. Forest definition must be assessed. Project developers and the government could also explore the voluntary carbon market which is more flexible than the CDM market. Policy and technical studies must be conducted to ascertain the potential of the REDD for CBFM sites in the country.

AB This study details the design and implementation of an online materials ire, chemistry general education (GE) course during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many pedagogical techniques involving active learning have been established in STEM major courses, their use within STEM general education courses for non-majors are not as well-established. The recently developed GE course at UCLA (termed Chemistry 3: Material World) utilized high-impact practices to introduce students to the scientific process and impart skills of critical thinking and scientific communication through its flexible activities and assignments. Emphasis was placed on collaborative learning, problem-solving, and interpreting scientific information from published reports. Additionally, content focused on social justice and community engagement was introduced throughout several topics (e.g., underrepresentation in science, war on drugs, nuclear proliferation, pollution, and global climate change) to showcase that chemistry is intricately related to bigger societal challenges. This article details our efforts in achieving the course learning outcomes and shares tangible results regarding the assessment of our teaching strategies from student feedback and reflections. We envision that this work will assist faculty in designing inclusive chemistry GE courses that focus on process versus content and adopting our teaching strategies in both in-person and online classrooms.

AB This paper reports on a systematic literature review of policy research in the area of environmental and sustainability education. We analyzed 215 research articles, spanning four decades and representing 71 countries, and which engaged a range of methodologies. Our analysis combines quantification of geographic and methodological trends with qualitative analysis of content-based themes. Significant findings included temporal spikes in published policy research occurring in the mid-1970s, late 1990s, and after 2005, as well as geographic under-representation of Africa, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, and North and West Asia. The majority of articles reviewed were non-empirical; empirical articles overwhelmingly focused on teaching and learning directives, rather than exploring the complexity of policy development or enactment. We conclude our analysis by describing key research gaps as highlighted by the review and propose directions for moving forward policy research in environmental and sustainability education. In particular, we suggest greater research attention to critical policy theory and methodology, issues of intersectionality, and climate change education policy research. By outlining in greater detail the policy research that has been undertaken to date, the review provides a platform for a broadened diversity of policy studies in environmental and sustainability education.

AB Managing integrated social-ecological systems to reduce risks to human and environmental well-being remains challenging in light of the rate and extent of undesirable changes that are occurring. Developing frameworks that are sufficiently integrative to guide research to deliver the necessary insights into all key system aspects is an important outstanding task. Among existing approaches, resilience and nexus framings both allow focus on unpacking relationships across scales and levels in a system and emphasize the involvement of different groups in decision making to different extents. They also suffer weaknesses and neither approach puts social justice considerations explicitly at its core. This has important implications for understanding who wins and loses out from different decisions and how social and ecological risks and trade-offs are shared and distributed, temporally and spatially. This paper conceptually integrates resilience and nexus approaches, developing a combined framework and indicating how it could effectively be operationalized in cases from mountain and mangrove social-ecological systems. In doing so, it advances understanding of complex social-ecological systems framings for risk-based decision making beyond that which could be achieved through use of either resilience or nexus approaches alone. Important next steps in testing the framework involve empirical and field operationalization, requiring interdisciplinary, mixed method approaches.

AB Gender inequality and discrimination challenge the most important international climate regime mechanism on forests REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) in achieving sustainable development and protecting forests. The backgrounding of a gender-specific perspective in REDD+ research is often justified from the premise that forests are an inherently male business and REDD+ is only a technical issue. Although millions of women, predominantly indigenous women, are involved in forest work and forestry their importance for natural resource management has been systematically devalued and invisibilized. This paper reviews the gender literature on climate change and REDD +-projects to elaborate on gender-specific subordination of women, with a closer attention to indigenous women, which hinder effective forest protection, fair resource allocation, gender equality and social justice. The paper integrates an autonomous model for climate change adaption lead by indigenous women, that documents not only the local climatic effects on agriculture and forests but develops responses beyond the top downmodel of REDD+. Through relying on knowledge from decades about territories, seasons, trees and cultural life systems indigenous women together with youth and community members were able to sustain food sovereignty in the context of climate change - and the broader goal of people led sustainable development.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; POLITICS; CITY
AB Problem, research strategy, and findings: Social justice is often considered the goal of participatory planning, yet justice is typically not operationalized, broadly defined, or clearly linked with participatory practice. We expand on Sherry Arnstein's concern with the redistribution of power between the state and citizens by juxtaposing her ladder of participation with Nancy Fraser's framework of justice. Fraser's approach to justice seeks parity-defined as the social arrangements that enable people to participate as peers in public life-across economic, cultural, and political domains. Fraser provides principles to guide planners in determining what is just and unjust in participatory initiatives. Principles include ensuring proper participatory procedures, recognizing minority viewpoints and perspectives, attending to the framing of public issues, and remediating inequitable social structures. We illustrate the practical application of Fraser's justice framework by drawing on examples from public engagement with climate change. Takeaway for practice: Although Fraser does not provide a tool kit for action, we offer suggestions for how planners can apply a justice framework to improve participatory practice. Planners can a) require appropriate procedures to ensure that all relevant people and perspectives are represented at the appropriate scale; b) ensure all perspectives-not just dominant ones-are recognized and valued; and c) respond to and mitigate the inequitable distribution of wealth and resources.

AB Adaptation needs in high mountain communities are increasingly well documented, yet most efforts to address these needs continue to befall mountain people who have contributed little to the problem of climate change. This situation represents a contravention of accepted norms of climate justice and calls attention to the need for better understanding of prospects for externally resourced adaptation initiatives in high mountain areas. In response, this paper examines the architecture of formal adaptation support mechanisms organized through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and how such mechanisms might help to meet adaptation needs in high mountain communities. It outlines key global adaptation initiatives organized through the UNFCCC, clarifies idealized linkages between these global adaptation initiatives and meeting local adaptation needs, and evaluates actual progress in connecting such support with discrete adaptation needs in the upper Manaslu region of Nepal. The paper then critically examines observed shortcomings in matching adaptation support organized through the UNFCCC with local adaptation needs, including complications stemming from the bureaucratic nature of formal adaptation support mechanisms, the intervening role of the state in delivering aid, and the ways in which these complexities intersect with the specific socio-cultural contexts of mountain communities. It concludes by highlighting several prospects for increasing the quantity and quality of adaptation support to mountain communities. These opportunities are considered alongside several salient concerns about formal adaptation support mechanisms in an effort to provide a well-rounded assessment of the prospects for planned adaptations in high mountain communities.

AB The time of gender-blind climate change policies and projects has passed. However, while research is increasingly moving away from understanding the relationship between gender and climate change in a linear, technocratic, and instrumental way, gender and climate change policy-makers and project practitioners are having difficulties operationalizing this progress. In the meantime, as climate change effects are increasingly felt worldwide, and because the policy context after the Paris Agreement (2015) is bringing new challenges for gender and equity concerns, (re-)politicizing the climate justice debate in a policy and project-relevant way is more crucial than ever. My aim in this article is to contribute to this endeavor by exploring how a feminist political ecology framework applied to a specific case study in Nicaragua one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world can generate new policy and project-relevant lessons and insights from the ground that can in turn strengthen the conceptual debate on gender and climate change adaptation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2013 and 2014, as well as eight years of professional experience as a development worker in Nicaragua, I discuss the workings of power in the feminist political ecology of climate change adaptation; in so doing I raise new questions that will, I hope, lead policy-makers and project practitioners to explore how adaptation processes could open up the conceptual possibility for emancipation, transformation, and new ways of living life in common.

AB Urban expansions to adjoining greenfield sites, particularly in metropolitan regions, have become a global occurrence. Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured. The study utilizes a remote sensing approach to investigate the impacts of a period of over 30 years (1989-2019) in Brisbane, Australia and its adjoining local government areas. The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.

AB Background: In 2000, the United Nations (UN) introduced the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), described as a global movement with the primary aim of ending world-wide poverty ("Millennium Summit," 2000). The second phase of the project, known as the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda offers an increased emphasis on lessening the mitigating factors associated with climate change and adapting to the negative effects of climate change. Nurses are in the unique position to address the health-related impacts related to climate change through community health approaches aimed at education and promotion of environmental stewardship.
   Purpose: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the relationships among the health consequences of climate change, nursing literature on climate change, and nursing implications. The following will be addressed: "What is nursing's role in policy, practice, and advocacy when addressing the effects of climate change? What is the importance of the SDGs as a framework for addressing climate change in the role of nursing?"
   Method: This scoping review of the literature was conducted which included the evaluation of a broad range of articles using scoping methods as frameworks.
   Findings: An overarching theme regarding the nursing community's responsibility in addressing the effects of climate change and their role as advocates, educators, and global citizens was extracted from the scoping review.
   Discussion: There are many opportunities for nurses to become actively involved in efforts aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in climate change, including becoming involved in policy, advocacy, research, and practice opportunities.

AB This research addresses recent environmental governance in Bolivia through its relations to indigeneity and respatializations. It introduces and develops the concept of "speaking like an indigenous state" to examine the Bolivian state's recent use of a pair of indigenous linguistic concepts, Living Well and Earth Mother, representing the identities of citizens and their rights to resources and livelihoods. State relations to indigenous social movements highlight the use of Living Well and Earth Mother concepts through accommodation, resistance, and protaganism. Six active issues of environmental governance are examined: (1) climate change and justice movement; (2) agrarian reform, agrobiodiversity, and food justice; (3) water resources; (4) indigenous territories; (5) Protected Areas; and (6) extractive industries (mining, hydrocarbons). The usages of Living Well and Earth Mother show versatility as they have been mobilized in the respatializing of the politics and social-power dynamics of environmental issues at scales of the state, global and international institutions, and community and local levels. Analysis also reveals deployment of Living Well and Earth Mother that is discursively influential and yet conceptually reduced and unevenly applied, thus suggesting a characteristic of verisimilitude. My analysis determines that respatialization at various levels, including territorial transitions of sub-national regional spaces, are associated with the heightened articulation of environmental governance through indigeneity and "speaking like an indigenous state" amid resource nationalism. Linkages and logics operating within this conjuncture differ from the prevailing interpretation of the Bolivian state's use of Living Well and Earth Mother as solely an unwitting contradiction or instrumentalist camouflage.

AB In this paper we analyze the relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in African countries. We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is warranted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE water; human rights; South Africa; Constitution; commons
AB Can a rights-based agenda potentially challenge the dominant market narrative with respect to water access, and in the process, also address climate change reparations, adaptation and mitigation? Learning from the case of water in the most advanced court challenge to neo-liberal state power that has yet been adjudicated, in Johannesburg in 2009, it is just as likely that rights-talk will be co-opted by neo-liberalism. If that happens more systematically within the climate justice struggle, at a time activism intensifies and court cases emerge more frequently, momentum towards a genuine breakthrough against corporate control of global environmental governance (amplified now under the rubric of the 'Green Economy') could well be distracted, halted or even reversed. The classical problems associated with rights-based narratives - their basis in liberal individualism and disconnection from broader socio-economic and ecological processes - may continue to be crippling, as witnessed in the example of South African water policy, law and activism. The specific case involves a Paris-based water privatisation company (Suez) whose policies in Johannesburg led five Sowetans to sue the city to increase water supply and cease imposing pre-payment meters. The same ideological debates - how to fuse neo-liberal imperatives with rights rhetoric - took centre stage during the June 2012 Rio+20 Earth Summit. There, the dominant trend towards market determinations of nature required a stronger countervailing 'decommodification' narrative than 'rights talk' can offer. The question posed here, is whether using human rights considerations will make contestation of 'neo-liberalised nature' any easier, and the answer arrived at is negative, based on the evidence from Johannesburg. Instead, 'commoning' is the alternative narrative, ie arriving at the commons through and beyond rights.

ID DEFORESTATION
AB From wildfires in Bolivia, floods, and mudslides in South Africa, Nepal, and Myanmar, to heatwaves in Australia and Europe, the impact of climate change is felt globally but in unequal measures, as developing and least developed countries suffer the most devastating impacts despite being the least contributors. As a result, climate change is center stage because countries and their governments, organisations as well as multinationals are battling to contain its effects. Through the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement, countries pledged to mitigate climate change in their capacities. However, some of these contributions are overly ambitious for poor countries like Cambodia measuring it against their national capacities. Therefore, this paper investigates Cambodia's official position on climate change vis-a-vis its current environmental practices, mitigation policies, and strategies by analysing three major climate change amplifiers - waste, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions to determine whether it is the environmentally friendly country it portrays itself to be internationally or simply greenwashing. This paper merges both qualitative content and document analyses of official policy documents and agreements, reports, data, and publications of major climate change stakeholders in Cambodia. By in-depth analysis, it is established that Cambodia shows commitment to combating climate change, however, with current environmental practices and policy implementation, Cambodia moves towards solving the pressing issues of hunger and poverty with economic growth and development as a priority before consideration for the climate and environment. On this basis, it is recommended that the least developed countries set and maintain realistic climate goals and continue to receive external support from developed countries with monitoring and evaluating systems established to be up to par in the fulfilment of global agendas such as Agenda 2030.

AB In the United Kingdom (UK), daily circulation figures for tabloid newspapers are as much as ten times higher than broadsheet sources. Nonetheless, studies of media representations of climate change in the UK to date have focused on broadsheet newspapers. Moreover, readership patterns correlate with socio-economic status; the majority of readers of tabloids are in 'working class' demographics. With a growing need to engage wider constituencies in awareness and potential behavioral change, it is important to examine how these influential sources represent climate change for a heretofore understudied segment of citizenry. This paper links political geographies with cultural issues of identity and discourse, through claims and frames on climate change in four daily 'working class' tabloid newspapers in UK - The Sun (and News of the World), Daily Mail (and Mail on Sunday), the Daily Express (and Sunday Express), and the Mirror (and Sunday Mirror). Through triangulated Critical Discourse Analysis, investigations of framing and semi-structured interviews, this project examines representations of climate change in these newspapers from 2000 through 2006. Data show that news articles on climate change were predominantly framed through weather events, charismatic megafauna and the movements of political actors and rhetoric, while few stories focused on climate justice and risk. In addition, headlines with tones of fear, misery and doom were most prevalent. These analyses then enable discussions of how these representations may influence ongoing climate science and governance interactions as well as political geographies, and (re)shape the contemporary cultural politics of climate change discourse.

AB As the pressure to address the climate crisis builds, scientists must walk the line between research and activism. This was apparent at the 2019 United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change - Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC - COP), the largest annual meeting to address the climate crisis via supranational policymaking. COP has convened annually since 1995 in effort to establish international agreements for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2015, was the launch pad for the UN Paris Climate Agreement (PCA). Here, we present our collective perspective as early-career researchers on COP, an institution that we believe plays a critical role in the future of our oceans. Given the current pledges from signatories to the PCA, Earth is expected to warm similar to 3 degrees C by 2100, with the majority of anthropogenic heat content stored throughout the ocean. For this reason, among others, we feel it is crucial for ocean scientists to have a baseline understanding of the negotiations unfolding at COP and within the UNFCCC. We also provide evidence that certain features/structures of COP formalize colonial hierarchies, marginalize certain groups, and threaten to perpetuate the drivers of the environmental crises we all face. Thus, we urge that the future of such gatherings include purposeful and self-reflective acts of restructuring the space they occupy, the solutions they advocate, and the ways in which power is distributed amongst participants. We balance our critique with examples of how this has already been successful at COP, particularly with respect to organizing around ocean-climate issues.

AB Global climate policy till date has focused on building consensus around a differentiated roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Equally important yet receiving less attention is the need to support adaptation of the most vulnerable communities to the increasingly severe impacts of climatic changes. The Paris Agreement, negotiated at the 21st COP in December 2015, 'stitches up' national contributions on adaptation and mitigation into a global agreement. This article first reviews the adaptation components of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by developed, emerging and least developed nations. Second, we examine how adaptation and the related themes of loss and damage have been dealt with in the Paris Agreement in terms of: global goal, legal form, review mechanisms and financing arrangements. Finally, we look at the possibility of evolving new arrangements and opportunities for strengthening global response to adaptation by drawing on references to human rights and climate justice in the Paris Agreement. We contend that the global response cannot be relegated to action by individual nations-partly and loosely supported by global financial and technological flows. The Paris Agreement has made significant steps in raising the importance of adaptation vis-a-vis mitigation in climate action but a lot of work remains to be done. In a sense, the top-down elements of adaptation action reflect long held negotiating positions and the skepticism of developed nations with respect to adaptation. For the post-Paris climate regime to be legitimate and earn the trust of developing nations, it must focus equally on adaptation and mitigation and address the special needs of vulnerable communities across the world.

AB Going to work has become such a ritualized activity for the modern human that few people challenge its relevance from a sustainability perspective. Since the Industrial Revolution, the prospect of unlimited growth with the aim of jobs creation has been dramatically associated with a massive social-ecological degradation that puts the Earth system at risk. In recent decades, a number of heterodox theories and policies are reconsidering our relationship with work in view of contemporaneous social-ecological challenges. This paper offers critical review of five contrasting approaches. Those promoting green jobs' consider the possibility of transforming ecological constraints into economic opportunities by incentivising eco-efficient innovations and generating new jobs. Conversely, critical approaches, such as working-time reduction (WTR), labour environmentalism, political ecology of work, and contributive economy and justice, defend decommodifying work to liberate pro-social and pro-environmental behaviours. We additionally present two opposing scenarios mainly inspired by critical theories. One illustrates the root causes of systemic lock-in leading to the present social-ecological work-life degradation, while the other illustrates perspectives on the politics of free time' and contributive economy and justice oriented towards building capabilities, and workers' emancipation and justice in search for more sustainable relationships with ecosystems.

AB Working with local level actors to enable country ownership is applauded within the multilateral climate finance landscape. However, are emerging adaptation interventions equitable by reflecting the priorities of local level vulnerable populations? This research sought to find out whether the engagement of local institutions in projects that seek to achieve country ownership enabled local level vulnerable groups to participate in and influence adaptation decision-making processes and outcomes, thereby enabling them to have a voice in local level adaptation. It used a case study of a Global Environmental Facility-managed coastal adaptation project in Tanzania, which sought to restore and protect mangroves to enable adaptation to sea level rise. Data was generated from 13 Focus Group Discussions and survey questionnaires administered to 629 individuals in three locations on the mainland of Tanzania and in Zanzibar. The findings indicate that community-based organizations were used to facilitate the implementation of project activities at the community level. However, participation spaces created in the project and facilitated by these local institutions were exclusionary and failed to enable vulnerable community groups to have a voice on mangrove restoration and protection. Use of these local institutions altered local level power relations and disempowered other pre-existing and (in)formal local resource management institutions. Community members questioned legitimacy of actions implemented by these local institutions. These findings suggest that working with local level stakeholders to generate country ownership does not automatically guarantee that actions will address the needs of local vulnerable groups. Multilateral climate finance institutions should acknowledge these risks and implement measures to address them.

AB Until fairly recently, consideration of religion has been marginal or even non-existent in the scholarly discourse about environmental politics. Renewed attention to the intersection of these fields has been encouraged by a recent widening in discussions of 'environmental values' to include the role of religious institutions and personal belief in forming spiritual environmental values and renewed attention to the place of ethics and religious institutions in global environmental politics. Following a range of historic declarations by religious leaders, the recent encyclical by Pope Francis signalled a new level of integration between Catholic concerns for social and environmental justice. Yet, much of the continued engagement by large environmental NGOs and governments has continued to ignore the complex interrelation of local, intermediate and transnational religious political ecology. In this article, which is based on data gathered during five years of fieldwork, primarily with British Christian REMOs (religious environmental movement organizations), I probe the complexities of political engagement with religious environmentalism which arise from the many different organizational iterations these groups may take. On the basis of such investigation I suggest that effective high-level engagement with REMO groups will be greatly enhanced by a nuanced understanding of the many different shapes that these groups can take, the various scales at which these groups organize, and the unique inflection that political action and group identity can take in a religious context.

   new materialisms; anthropocene
AB This article seeks to materialize social theories of modern temporalities. It proposes a tempo-material analysis of carbon resources like coal, oil, and gas to illuminate how fossil materialities both underpin and undermine modern temporalities and introduce the notion of fossil modernity to evoke an understanding of the modern composed of multiple conflicting modes of material temporality. Fossil resources (fossil fuels and petrochemical substances) drive the pace and progressive perspective of modernity. The residuals of these resources (CO2, plastic waste, and petrochemical toxins) confront societies with long-lasting ecological damage. Fossil fuels helped to produce the expectation of growth and endless possibility. Fossil residuals create a horizon of ecological liabilities in which past options have become future obligations. This renders the pretences of "modernization" understood as a process of constant renewal and innovation problematic. The article argues that modern societies cannot simply overcome their material-temporal predicaments through "decarbonization" because even after a shift to solar power, organic agriculture, and sustainable plastics, the fossil past will continue to influence, inform, and incite social operations. The article thus shows how different responses to the problems of fossil modernity need to go back to and emerge from the material residues of the past: this goes for bio-capitalist projects seeking to "recycle" the entropic temporality of fossil residuals as well as for environmental justice movements that decipher these residuals as indexes of social asymmetries and call for socio-ecological "redistribution."

AB This qualitative study draws on in-depth interviews and documentary analysis conducted between 2014 and 2016 to investigate the nature of pro-environmental behaviour of members within the Eco-Congregation Scotland network. We argue for an integrative analytical frame, that we call eco-theo-citizenship, which synthesises strengths of values-, practice- and citizenship-based approaches to the study of pro-environmental behaviour within the specific context of religious environmental groups. This study finds the Eco-Congregation groups studied are not primarily issue driven, and instead have an emphasis on community-building activities and a concept of environmental citizenship which spans multiple political scales from local to international. Primary values emphasised included environmental justice and stewardship. Analysis of the data indicated that groups in this network are distinctive in two particular ways: (1) group focus on mobilising values and environmental concern towards community building can produce what looks like a more conservative approach to climate change mobilisation, preserving and working slowly within institutional structures, with a primary focus not on climate change mitigation per se but on the consolidation and development of the community and broader network; and (2) these groups can often under-report their accomplishments and the footprint of their work on the basis of a common religious conviction which we have termed a culture of modesty.

AB As cornerstones for biodiversity conservation, protected areas (PAs) are critical to safeguard biodiversity. However, PAs are criticized for their limited ecological effectiveness and their negative social impacts. This article seeks to provide an overview on the contested nature of PAs and places PAs in the tension field of conservation and development, which are diverging forces specifically in the Global South. A reconciliation of PAs as parts of a wider landscape of interlinked social-ecological systems may increase the potential of PAs to contribute to the sustainable development goals, including the creation of sustainable human-nature relationships, environmental health and landscape resilience. The environmental justice framework appears useful in the endeavour to improve the social-ecological integrity of current conservation practises and to increase the ability of PA systems to withstand shocks. Considering PAs as systems in which people and nature interact in manifold ways may help increase their integrity, but understanding these interactions requires sustainability researchers and conservation practitioners to recognize the plurality in value towards nature, nature understanding and conceptualisations. Such deep understanding seems pivotal in working towards synergies of sustainable use, biocultural diversity and wilderness. Concludingly, this article emphasizes the need for holistic approaches rather than sectoral specialisations and radicalisations to achieve arrays of sustainability goals.

AB A key criterion of successful adaptation to climate change is that it avoids potential inequalities arising from climate impacts or from adaptation strategies themselves. Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people's daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second homeowners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people centric values for achieving fair adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global climate change is one of the most severe problems facing societies around the world. Very few assessments of the social forces that influence greenhouse gas emissions have examined gender inequality. Empirical research suggests that women are more likely than men to support environmental protection. Various strands of feminist theory suggest that this is due to women's traditional roles as caregivers, subsistence food producers, water and fuelwood collectors, and reproducers of human life. Other theorists argue that women's status and environmental protection are linked because the exploitation of women and the exploitation of nature are interconnected processes. For these theoretical and empirical reasons, we hypothesize that in societies with greater gender equality there will be relatively lower impacts on the environment, controlling for other factors. We test this hypothesis using quantitative analysis of cross-national data, focusing on the connection between women's political status and CO2 emissions per capita. We find that CO2 emissions per capita are lower in nations where women have higher political status, controlling for GDP per capita, urbanization, industrialization, militarization, world-system position, foreign direct investment, the age dependency ratio, and level of democracy. This finding suggests that efforts to improve gender equality around the world may work synergistically with efforts to curtail global climate change and environmental degradation more generally.

AB Global efforts for biodiversity protection and land use -based greenhouse gas mitigation call for increases in the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental conservation. Incentive -based pol- icy instruments are key tools for meeting these goals, yet their effectiveness might be undermined by such factors as social norms regarding whether payments are considered fair. We investigated the causal link between equity and conservation effort with a randomized real -effort experiment in forest conservation with 443 land users near a tropical forest national park in the Vietnam- ese Central Annamites, a global biodiversity hotspot. The experi- ment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribu- tion. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by in- equality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive -based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substan- tially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing pay- ment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change.

ID ADULT-EDUCATION
AB In this paper, we explore the concept of Nannagogy, an innovative pedagogy of informal adult learning enacted by the activist `disorganisation, the Knitting Nannas Against Gas and Greed (KNAGs). The Arannas' are predominantly older women who undertake non-violent direct action using fibre craft, knit-ins, lock-ons, and occasional street theatre to draw public attention to the negative environmental impacts of unconventional coal seam gas extraction ('fracking') and of fossil fuel mining. We identify the characteristics of Nannagogy as a hybrid system of lifelong / later-in-life learning and a complex pedagogy of informal learning that can be understood through social movement learning theory (SML) drawing on Paolo Freire's (1970) original concept of `conscientisation'. Nannagogy is an act of radical adult education that has its antecedents in feminist collective learning strategies such as consciousness raising as well as the formal education strategies of action learning and communities of practice. Nannagogy is highly effective adult learning practice at the intersection of adult learning theory and social movement theory. Data presented in this paper were collected with active KNAG members in Australia as part of a PhD study using surveys, interviews, document analysis of social media (Facebook posts, digital videos, e-news bulletins) and researcher autoethnography. Framing activist adult learning as social movement learning locates environmental and climate justice struggles within lifelong learning practices and enables researchers to better understand the complex processes of informal, situated and often spontaneous adult learning for creating and sustaining movements for social, environmental and political change.

TI Identifying burdens of coping with climate change: A typology of the
   duties of climate justice

ID EMISSIONS
AB One of the central questions in climate change debates concerns fair burden-sharing, i.e. justice in the distribution of costs of undertaking climate-managing policies. In this paper it is argued that in order to distribute such costs justly, it is necessary to have a nuanced understanding of what types of burdens they represent. Climate managing policies are usually divided into responses that seek to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mitigation) and responses that seek to prevent harm arising from a changing climate (adaptation). Some have argued that there are normatively significant differences between mitigation and adaptation: that the two responses adhere to different logics and evoke different patterns of burden-sharing. This paper argues that the relevant distinction is instead between negative and positive climate duties, i.e. whether an agent has a duty to undertake climate-managing policies on account of the harm its excessive emissions are causing or simply on account of its ability to assist those in need. The paper offers a typology of the different mitigation and adaptation responses that can be sorted under the negative/positive distinctions. This way of conceptualizing the issue not only enables us to better address the burden-sharing question, offering a more nuanced understanding of the types of climate burdens that are ascribable to agents and pointing out the appropriate roles of contributory responsibility and ability. It also clarifies aspects of the climate negotiations, and explains why it matters whether adaptation finance transferred to vulnerable countries is portrayed as compensation for harmful emissions or simply as donor countries discharging their humanitarian duties.

AB Extreme summertime heat is a significant public health threat that disproportionately impacts vulnerable urban populations. Research on health impacts of climate change (including increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of hot weather) is sometimes designed and implemented without the involvement of the communities being studied, i.e., community-placed not community-based. We describe how the Heatwaves, Housing, and Health: Increasing Climate Resiliency in Detroit (HHH) partnership engaged relevant communities by integrating a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach into an existing, academic-designed research project through a steering committee of community and academic partners. Using a case study approach, we analyze program documentation, partnership evaluation questionnaires, and HHH steering committee meeting notes. We describe the CBPR process by which we successfully collected research data in Detroit during summer 2016, engaged in collaborative analysis of data, and shared results with Detroit residents. Evaluations of the partnership over 2 years show community involvement in research; enhanced capacities; success in securing new grant funding; and ways that CBPR strengthened the validity, relevance, and translation of research. Engaging communities as equal partners using CBPR, even after a study is underway, can strengthen research to understand and address the impacts of extreme heat on health and equity in urban communities.

AB Despite growing consensus that Indigenous peoples, knowledge systems, rights and solutions should be meaningfully included in international climate change governance, substantive improvements in practice remain limited. An expanding body of scholarship examines the evolving discursive space in which issues facing Indigenous peoples are treated, with a predominant focus on decision outcomes of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). To understand the opportunities and constraints for meaningful participation of Indigenous peoples in international climate policy making, this article examines the experiences of Indigenous participants in the UNFCCC. We present findings from semistructured interviews with key informants, showing that material constraints and the designation of Indigenous peoples as nonstate observers continue to pose challenges for participants. Tokenism and a lack of meaningful recognition further constrain participation. Nevertheless, networks of resource sharing, coordination, and support organized among Indigenous delegates alleviate some of the impacts of constraints. Additionally, multistakeholder alliances and access to presidencies and high-level state delegates provide opportunities for international and national agenda-setting. The space available for Indigenous participation in the UNFCCC is larger than formal rules dictate but depends on personal relationships and political will. As the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform established by the Paris Agreement formalizes a distinct space for Indigenous participants in the UNFCCC, this article outlines existing opportunities and constraints and considers potential interactions between the evolving platform and existing mechanisms for participation.

AB How green spaces in cities benefit urban residents depends critically on the interaction between biophysical and socio-economic factors. Urban ecosystem services are affected by both ecosystem characteristics and the social and economic attributes of city dwellers. Yet, there remains little synthesis of the interactions between ecosystem services, urban green spaces, and socio-economic factors. Articulating these linkages is key to their incorporation into ecosystem service planning and management in cities and to ensuring equitable outcomes for city inhabitants. We present a conceptual model of these linkages, describe three major interaction pathways, and explore how to operationalize the model. First, socio-economic factors shape the quantity and quality of green spaces and their ability to supply services by influencing management and planning decisions. Second, variation in socio-economic factors across a city alters people's desires and needs and thus demands for different ecosystem services. Third, socio-economic factors alter the type and amount of benefit for human wellbeing that a service provides. Integrating these concepts into green space policy, planning, and management would be a considerable improvement on 'standards-based' urban green space planning. We highlight the implications of this for facilitating tailored planning solutions to improve ecosystem service benefits across the socio-economic spectrum in cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Low-income households may be disproportionately affected by ozone pollution and ozone policy. We quantify how three factors affect the relative benefits of ozone policies with household income: (1) unequal ozone reductions; (2) policy delay; and (3) economic valuation methods. We model ozone concentrations under baseline and policy conditions across the full continental United States to estimate the distribution of ozone-related health impacts across nine income groups. We enhance an economic model to include these impacts across household income categories, and present its first application to evaluate the benefits of ozone reductions for low-income households. We find that mortality incidence rates decrease with increasing income. Modeled ozone levels yield a median of 11 deaths per 100 000 people in 2005. Proposed policy reduces these rates by 13%. Ozone reductions are highest among low-income households, which increases their relative welfare gains by up to 4% and decreases them for the rich by up to 8%. The median value of reductions in 2015 is either $30 billion (in 2006 U.S. dollars) or $1 billion if reduced mortality risks are valued with willingness-to-pay or as income from increased life expectancy. Ozone reductions were relatively twice as beneficial for the lowest- compared to the highest-income households. The valuation approach affected benefits more than a policy delay or differential ozone reductions with income.

AB As the pressure to address the climate crisis builds, scientists must walk the line between research and activism. This was apparent at the 2019 United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change - Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC - COP), the largest annual meeting to address the climate crisis via supranational policymaking. COP has convened annually since 1995 in effort to establish international agreements for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2015, was the launch pad for the UN Paris Climate Agreement (PCA). Here, we present our collective perspective as early-career researchers on COP, an institution that we believe plays a critical role in the future of our oceans. Given the current pledges from signatories to the PCA, Earth is expected to warm similar to 3 degrees C by 2100, with the majority of anthropogenic heat content stored throughout the ocean. For this reason, among others, we feel it is crucial for ocean scientists to have a baseline understanding of the negotiations unfolding at COP and within the UNFCCC. We also provide evidence that certain features/structures of COP formalize colonial hierarchies, marginalize certain groups, and threaten to perpetuate the drivers of the environmental crises we all face. Thus, we urge that the future of such gatherings include purposeful and self-reflective acts of restructuring the space they occupy, the solutions they advocate, and the ways in which power is distributed amongst participants. We balance our critique with examples of how this has already been successful at COP, particularly with respect to organizing around ocean-climate issues.

AB This article engages with radical critiques of the Eurocentric grammar of development discourses. I start from a position of considerable sympathy with their appreciation of the discursive dimensions of power that attach to the idiom of development and their solidarity with the oppositional projects of subaltern groups. However, this sympathy combines with a considerable degree of disagreement in terms of how the discursive power of development is understood and how the dynamics of popular resistance are theorised. As an alternative to the relatively crude postulation of development as a discursive regime that enables the West to exercise power over the Rest, I develop an argument that emphasises the multivalent character of the idiom of development and trace this multivalence to situated contestations that take place between opposing political projects that strive to shape the form and direction of social change in specific ways. Furthermore, I will argue that this contentious dynamic becomes particularly evident in those world-historical conjunctures when subaltern groups mobilize around social movement projects that destabilise hegemonic power relations in the capitalist world-system. To illustrate this point, I will provide a broad-brushed outline of three distinct 'development regimes' that have shaped North-South relations from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first century and discuss the ways in which these regimes have been destabilised by the articulation of oppositional meanings of development articulated from below by progressive social movement projects. Finally, I draw on my own fieldwork experiences to reflect on how critical scholars can engage with movement projects that challenge the dominant directions and meanings of development in ways that can contribute to democratic deliberations within social movements.

AB The world is too complex for humans to grasp. Frames and news values (or 'journalistic selection procedures') make it more intelligible, foregrounding salient elements. Giving shape to reality, both concepts cannot be separated from ideological interests, either. Previous research suggests, accordingly, that frames and newsworthiness take shape in mutual interaction. Yet, the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear as in-depth discursive research is lacking. Therefore, we have conducted a combined framing-news value analysis, drawing on a corpus of climate articles published in three mainstream and two alternative media outlets in Northern Belgium. This article discusses the relations among four selected news values and the ideologically coloured subframes of the Cycles of Nature and Environmental Justice frames. The presented schemata and exemplary analyses demonstrate the strong overlap between the salience-enhancing devices of subframes and news values. Also, they make tangible the ideological argumentations at the intersection of newsworthiness and framing, explicating the diverging realizations of news values in the context of various subframes. As such, this study lays bare some of the journalistic conventions which are often used in climate reporting to naturalize certain worldviews. Moreover, it contributes to the development of the Discursive News Values Analysis framework proposed by (Bednarek and Caple (2017). The Discourse of News Values.

ID ANTHROPOCENE
AB The idea of the "Anthropocene" is rapidly gaining currency as an ecocritical lens through which to view theater and performance. But as a lens for critical analysis, the concept of the "Anthropocene" is problematic, primarily because it fails to differentiate among humans, many of whom are in conflict precisely because the benefits and costs of the "Age of Man" have been distributed unevenly. Neo-Marxist critics take such conflicts into fuller account in their argument that a better nomenclature and concept for our epoch is the "Capitalocene," a term that captures the fact that our ecological crises have been precipitated not by humans in some undifferentiated and generalized way, but more specifically by the global spread of capitalism and its socio-economic-ecological injustices. These are also conflicts at the heart of many plays, both historical and recent. This essay offers an overview of a number of works that might productively be categorized as "Tragedies of the Capitalocene," insofar as they dramatize stories that trace the dynamics of "Capitalocene" exploitation of both human and nonhuman resources. Plays considered include Cherrie Moraga's Heroes and Saints (1992), Rahul Varma's Bhopal (2001), Kia Corthron's A Cool Dip in the Barren Saharan Crick (2010), Annabel Soutar's Seeds (2012), Robert Schenkkan's The Kentucky Cycle (1991), and Colleen Murphy's The Breathing Hole (2017).

AB Global environmental changes can happen quickly or over extended periods and have compounding effects. Indigenous communities experience environmental changes that can lead to a decline in quality of life, illness or disease, and unwelcome cultural adaptations that extend to future generations. Due to limited resources and political marginalization, members of these communities may not be able to respond to or prevent these conditions. Cultural connections to the land and community, along with limited resources, impact Indigenous peoples' willingness and ability to relocate to different geographic locations experiencing less damaging ecological changes or environmental risk. In this article, we respond to the Special Issue prompt probing "[m]ethods in which Indigenous communities engage within their environment and on the land to conduct research". We begin by describing environmental change, followed by a scoping review of Photovoice studies focused on environmental issues. Environmental changes affecting Indigenous groups are discussed, including a case study and a discussion of the ways that Photovoice can support and honor Indigenous peoples' connection to the natural environment. This article is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but rather seeks to understand how Photovoice is being used to respond to and document environmental change, and how such visual methodologies can be used in Indigenous communities.

AB The European Union and the United States have significantly different approaches when addressing climate change. It is reasonable to think that the actions of the EU and the US, as powerful entities in global politics, influence the contours and effectiveness of the international climate change regime. The EU has for a long time strived to play the strongest role possible in international climate negotiations and to maximise its climate change targets, which is reflected through its climate policies and legal implementation of the international climate change regime. The situation in the US is more polarised, with the Republican Party almost uniformly denying the existence of climate change and any human impact on rising global temperatures. Instead of taking scientific reports on impacts, risks and adaptation to climate change seriously, the Trump administration is focused on increasing US production of oil, natural gas and coal. Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing to combat climate change, build a clean energy economy and secure environmental justice. This article explores and explains the legal differences in the EU and the US responses to climate change and climate change targets, and considers the possible contributing factors. The assessment takes account of policies at the highest governing level, thus not taking account of what is happening among some US states.

AB Cities confronted with unsustainable development and climatic changes are increasingly turning to green infrastructure as an approach for growth and climate risk management. In this context, recent scholarly attention has been paid to gentrification, real-estate speculation and resident displacement in the context of sustainability and green planning in the global North. Yet we know little about the environmental-justice implications of green infrastructure planning in the context of self-built settlements of the global South. To what extent do green infrastructure interventions produce or exacerbate urban socio-spatial inequities in self-built settlements? Through the analysis of a greenbelt project, an emblematic case of green infrastructure planning in Medellin, we argue that, as the Municipality of Medellin is containing and beautifying low-income neighborhoods through grabbing part of their territories and turning them into green landscapes of privilege and pleasure, communities are becoming dispossessed of their greatest assets-location, land and social capital. In the process, community land is transformed into a new form of aesthetically controlled and ordered nature for the middle and upper classes and for tourists. By contrast, communities' planning alternatives reveal how green planning can better address growth and climate risks in tandem with equitable community development.

AB Many researches have highlighted the importance of environmental justice, where healthy environment is a right to all. Currently, the most vulnerable groups to climate change are low-income urban dwellers, typically residing in urban informalities within cities of the Global South. In Cairo, the awareness about climate change and responsive consumption is minimal and the increase in temperature could have serious effects on residents' health. In 2012, informalities were reported to house two thirds of the population and covered a third of the city's footprint. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of studying environmental performance in informal areas to achieve sustainability and reduce risks. It reviews work related to sustainable urbanization, informal areas, urban heat island and urban climate especially in Cairo. It defines needed parameters and develops an integrated tool to assess comfort in outdoor spaces microclimate. The paper relies on extensive fieldwork, meteorological measurements, socio-environmental surveys, activity mapping and modelling to study both Cairo urban climate and microclimate in one of Cairo's densest informal districts. The paper stresses the possibility of introducing responsive low-tech and low-cost strategies and interventions. This is discussed as an inherent right to marginalized areas and a necessity within a continuous process of urbanization.

AB Climate change is the most serious and most pervasive risk faced by the natural world and by global human society. The Australian continent is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; however, effective national political responses appear to be compromised at every turn. Concerned groups and individuals are unsurprisingly seeking environmental justice in courts and tribunals, and litigation has challenged some of the largest coal developments in Australia. This article examines challenges in the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland jurisdictions by means of merits review and judicial review against coal mining project proposals in order to evaluate the approaches taken by tribunals and courts to the environmental assessment of coal projects. The recent decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court in Gloucester Resources Ltd v Minister for Planning has set rigorous new standards for assessment and approval processes with respect to coal projects. To this point decision-makers have taken conservative views of their powers to go beyond the immediate objective of the mining tenure or authorisation being sought, and have accepted the market substitution argument that if we do not mine the coal then someone, somewhere will and we will be no better off. On the other side, some courts have offered leadership in the development of progressive methodologies, such as a broader "public interest" test that embraces climate change issues, of which the Gloucester decision has been the high point.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
AB Energy poverty remains an enduring challenge in Bangladesh, with 41 million people lacking electricity. Foreign states, corporations, and financial institutions have historically shaped the form and terms of the country's energy system, which is predominantly fossil fuel based. Shifting geographies of energy extraction and processing continue to reflect this past and influence current national energy debates in Bangladesh. The Rampal coal-fired energy project, a joint initiative with India, exemplifies these tensions. Opposition to the Rampal plant, proposed in the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans region, and other controversial energy extraction and processing projects led some activists and impacted stakeholders to promote the idea of "our energy, our rights." The articulation of an energy rights discourse asserts that Bangladesh should extract and control national energy resources in a manner that respects rights and provides the basis for analyzing the energy justice landscape in the nation and beyond. The rights discourse rejects the nation's legacy of poor energy decisions, and the associated realities of energy poverty. Contributing to emerging ideas around the geographies of energy justice, this research paper explores the practical application by activists and stakeholders of rights discourses to contested energy projects in Bangladesh. It shows how distributional energy justice activism critiques the historical political economy of economic liberalization and energy exploitation in the country and centers the rights concerns of energy poverty while also considering climate change vulnerabilities.

AB This paper contributes to nascent efforts to highlight the urban dimensions of global environmental change (GEC) and human security to reflect humankind's now predominantly urban locus. Following an overview of key issues and concerns within recent urban research relevant to human security, we draw attention to appropriate conceptual frameworks and methodological tools for understanding risk and vulnerability in the context of acute inequalities, poverty and the unsustainability of contemporary urbanism. This requires a combination of political, ecological and sustainable livelihoods analysis, linked to agendas of social and environmental justice. Key urban challenges for human security in the context of GEC relate to overall ecological footprints, maintaining institutional and infrastructural integrity, and safeguarding shelter, utilities, economic activities and livelihoods. These take on somewhat different complexions in coastal and inland urban areas. Although in wealthier parts of the world urbanization has generally stabilized or declined, it continues to increase in many poorer regions as a result of complex forces and processes. These increasingly include mobility to escape rural impoverishment and hunger through the adverse effects of GEC on rural livelihoods. The challenge of providing for large in-migrant populations in expanding cities with inadequate resourcing, while at the same time seeking to mitigate and adapt to the effects of GEC, is likely to create threats to political stability and human security in many contexts.

AB The California Community Environmental Health Screening Tool (CalEnviroScreen) advances research and policy pertaining to environmental health vulnerability. However, CalEnviroScreen departs from its historical foundations and comparable screening tools by no longer considering racial status as an indicator of environmental health vulnerability and predictor of cumulative pollution burden. This study used conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques from environmental health and inequality literature to address the limitations of CalEnviroScreen, especially its inattention to race-based environmental health vulnerabilities. It developed an adjusted measure of cumulative pollution burden from the CalEnviroScreen 2.0 data that facilitates multivariate analyses of the effect of neighborhood racial composition on cumulative pollution burden, net of other indicators of population vulnerability, traffic density, industrial zoning, and local and regional clustering of pollution burden. Principal component analyses produced three new measures of population vulnerability, including Latina /o cumulative disadvantage that represents the spatial concentration of Latinas/os, economic disadvantage, limited English-speaking ability, and health vulnerability. Spatial error regression analyses demonstrated that concentrations of Latinas/os, followed by Latina /o cumulative disadvantage, are the strongest demographic determinants of adjusted cumulative pollution burden. Findings have implications for research and policy pertaining to cumulative impacts and race-based environmental health vulnerabilities within and beyond California.

SO EPIDEMIOLOGY

ID HEALTH
AB The global environment is in critical decline. Whether one's concern about environmental epidemiology stems from the perspectives of environmental health, climate change, ecological collapse, or growing inequity, clear problems exist. Natural capital resources are being depleted; disregard for the integrity of ecosystems is entrenched in current business practices. Indeed, despite increasing rhetoric to the contrary, the disregard displayed by those who hold power globally toward long-term sustainability and, thus, the health and well-being of future generations, could be described as wanton. Six years ago, the Millennium Development Goals were announced by the United Nations as a rallying point for action to achieve a sustainable future, particularly by reducing the gap between the "have mores" and "have nots." The attainment of these Goals is now endangered, as is, apparently, the spirit of optimism and idealism that inspired them at the Millennium Summit. We call for a reinvigoration of both concern about-and action on-sustainability. In particular, we appeal to those engaged in the field of environmental epidemiology (and other specialties with whom they engage) to consider how they might help by incorporating sustainability issues (including global ecological integrity and global environmental justice) into their own research programs. This incorporation would make a vital contribution to protect both present and future generations and to reduce resource and health gaps between North and South. Simply put, we propose that sustainability becomes integral to advancing the science of environmental epidemiology and related environmental disciplines.

AB Indigenous peoples are easily classified as either dangerously vulnerable or inherently resilient to climate risks. There are elements of truth in both categorical statements. Yet neither is completely true. Indigenous vulnerability and resilience, and Indigenous groups' adaptive responses to climate change, need to be understood in the messy contexts of lived experience, rather than either elegant social theories or didactic ideological politics. Climate change action and research needs to acknowledge and engage with the knowledges, ontologies and experiences of diverse Indigenous groups, along with the specific histories, geographies and impacts of colonization, and their consequences for both the colonized and colonizers. Climate change action and research needs to be integrated into wider de-colonial projects as the transformative impacts of anthropogenic climate change are inadequately addressed within both colonial and post-colonial frames. Negotiating respectful modes of belonging-together-in-Country to reshape people-to-people, people-to-environment and people-to-cosmos relationships in Indigenous domains is essential in responding to planetary scale changes in coupled human and natural systems. This paper outlines an approach that nurtures Indigenous self-determination and inter-generational healing to rethink the geopolitics of Indigenous resilience, vulnerability and adaptation in an era of climate change and the resurgence of Great Power geopolitics.

AB Flood risk of all types of flooding is projected to increase based on climate change projections and increases in damage potential. These challenges are likely to aggravate issues of justice in flood risk management (hereafter FRM). Based on a discursive institutionalist perspective, this paper explores justice in Dutch FRM: how do institutions allocate the responsibilities and costs for FRM for different types of flooding? What are the underlying conceptions of justice? What are the future challenges with regard to climate change? The research revealed that a dichotomy is visible in the Dutch approach to FRM: despite an abundance of rules, regulations and resources spent, flood risk or its management is only marginally discussed in terms of justice. Despite that, the current institutional arrangement has material outcomes that treat particular groups of citizens differently, depending on the type of flooding they are prone to, area they live in (unembanked/embanked) or category of user (e.g. household, industry, farmer). The paper argues that the debate on justice will (re)emerge, since the differences in distributional outcomes are likely to become increasingly uneven as a result of increasing flood risk. The Netherlands should be prepared for this debate by generating the relevant facts and figures. An inclusive debate on the distribution of burdens of FRM could contribute to more effective and legitimate FRM.

AB Air pollution is one of the most significant environmental hazards. The elderly, young, and poor are more vulnerable to air pollution. The risk of air pollution was assessed based on the risk framework published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in terms of three aspects: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This study determined the concentrations of hazardous pollutants using satellite images from 2015 at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. In addition, the study identified vulnerable groups who are exposed to hazardous air pollutants. The study highlighted the degree of vulnerability based on environmental sensitivity and institutional abilities, such as mitigation and social adaption policies, using statistical data. Based on the results, Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province have low air pollution risk owing to good institutional abilities, while the western coastal area has the highest air pollution risk. Three adaption pathway scenarios were assessed in terms of the effect of increases in the budget for social adaptation policies on the level of risk. The study found that the risk can be reduced when the social adaptation budget of 2015 base level is increased by 20% in Gyeonggi Province and by 30% in the western coastal area. In conclusion, this risk assessment can support policy-making to target more vulnerable groups based on scientific evidence and to ensure environmental justice at the national level.

AB We examine varying levels of perceived environmental risks among nine U.S. race and ethnic group categories using the 2010 General Social Survey. Three interrelated questions motivate our analysis. First, how does the environmental risk perception of air pollution, water pollution, agricultural chemicals, climate change and nuclear power generation vary among specific categories of race and ethnicity? Second, to what degree are higher levels of perceived risk among immigrant-origin groups subject to change as a result of cultural assimilation over generations? And third, to what degree are race and ethnic differences in environmental risk perception a reflection of other possibly more significant factors such as education, income, gender and conservative political views? Though we find some evidence for attitude assimilation among generations of Mexican-origin people, the dominant pattern is greater perceived risks among non-whites than whites across generations in the U.S. Additionally, not only did race and ethnic groups show greater concern for the threats posed by climate change and nuclear power generation than whites, they also expressed more concern about these two topics than they did for more localized issues such as air pollution emanating from industry and transportation. Despite our statistical controls for socioeconomic status, race and ethnic categories remained strong independent predictors of perceived environmental threats.

AB We evaluate the current status of the global marine fisheries using the frameworks of conflict, food security and vulnerability. Existing trends suggest that there is likely to be greater food insecurity and fisheries conflicts due to issues such as: declining fishery resources; a North-South divide in investment; changing consumption patterns; increasing reliance on fishery resources for coastal communities; and inescapable poverty traps creating by low net resource productivity and few alternatives. Consequently, managing fisheries from a food security perspective will become increasingly necessary, and we therefore briefly review fisheries from the perspective of food security and evaluate it using a vulnerability framework. Specifically, we describe three key components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) for selected fisheries. This is followed by proposals to build the adaptive capacity of fisheries and recommendations to avoid future conflicts. Adaptive capacity attributes include assets, social flexibility and organization attributes, and learning. We present some key ways to build these aspects of the fishery to reduce the many potential environmental and social threats that increase the vulnerability of fisheries. Recommendations include fewer subsidies, reduced capital investment, precautionary management to minimize risks of ecosystem collapse, conservation of remaining resources, diversified portfolios of production and markets, and greater equity in contracts and distribution. Further, we recommend a contextual diagnostic and environmental justice framework to assess a range of options for fishery governance.

AB This article contributes to the emergent field of corporate activism by exploring how corporate advertising voices, or is interpreted by the media as voicing, Trump resistance - that is, sympathy with anti-Trump protests and dismay at the politics of the White House incumbent. In so doing, we first situate corporate activism in relation to the more established fields of political corporate social responsibility and corporate social responsibility communication, focusing on discussions concerning the interplay between talk and action as well as the potential of talk to lead to action. On this basis, we propose a conceptual framework that posits talk and action as operating conjointly on the ontological plane of s(t)imulation, a conceptual conjunction of simulation and stimulation that is inspired by Baudrillard's notion of the simulacrum. Empirically, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 20 examples of corporate advertising that has been reported as anti-Trump in the media. We find that the advertising in our sample is characterized by the following three main distinctions: (1) humorous references to Trump, (2) favourable and highly emotional appeals to social justice and (3) dystopian visions of society. We argue that a postmodern perspective on signs and representation may not only nuance our understanding of corporate activism, but also contribute to the conceptualization of the phenomenon by pushing the explanatory framework beyond the dialectic of talk and action.

AB Nature based solutions are amongst other practices that transition initiatives work with when intervening in their place and change its fabric. Focusing on the actors establishing, driving and scaling these solutions in and across cities, we come to evince that nature-based solutions have transformative social impact since they mediate new social relations and new social configurations contributing to social innovation in cities, and change nature perception and human-nature relations in urban contexts. We built from evidence in three city-regions that over the past years they saw the proliferation of community-based and policy-based initiatives with the aim to improve sustainability, livability and the aspiration to foster inclusivity and social justice in their cities: the city of Dresden in Germany, the city of Genk in Belgium and the city-region of Stockholm in Sweden. We will elaborate on the different ways nature based solutions as practices of transition initiatives in cities get scaled and contribute to accelerating sustainability transitions in these city-regions. In line with this, we will draw cross-case lessons for urban planning on the tensions transition initiatives that experiment with and institutionalize nature-based solutions in their cities face when actively pursue acceleration strategies and pathways to scale.

AB Purpose - The social dimensions of the relationship between transport and climate change are examined, in particular, the potential for unintended negative consequences to directly and/or indirectly arise from policies to reduce the climate change impact of the transport sector. It takes the example of current policies in the UK as its primary focus.
   Methodology/approach - A combination of literature, policy review and the quantitative and qualitative evidence gathered through primary fieldwork research from a number of related studies.
   Findings - It is identified that different social groups can experience very different outcomes in accessing transport and adapting to changes to the transport system, whether these are uniquely targeted towards certain individuals or more systemically applied across the whole population. For this reason, it is essential that policy makers fully understand the potential vulnerability and resilience of different social groups to policies that are intended to address transport-related climate change. The key component of social impacts should be systematically analyzed, by income, potential vulnerability and their spatial and temporal distribution, as well as according to resilience/adaptability to the proposed intervention. This continues to pose an important future challenge for research in this area of transport policy making.
   Originality/value - This chapter highlights the potential for unintended negative social consequences to directly and/or indirectly arise from policies to reduce the climate change impact of the transport sector.

AB The paper investigates whether farm dwellers in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province of South Africa are subject to a double exposure: vulnerable both to the impacts of post-apartheid agrarian dynamics and to the risks of climate change. The evidence is drawn from a 2017 survey that was undertaken by the Association for Rural Advancement (AFRA), which is a land rights Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), of 843 farm dweller households. Data on the current living conditions and livelihoods was collected on 15.3% of the farm dweller population in the area. The paper demonstrates that farm dwellers are a fragmented, agricultural precariat subject to push and pull drivers of mobility that leave them with a precarious hold on rural farm dwellings. The key provocation is that we need to be attentive to whether the hold farm dwellers have over land and livelihoods is slipping further as a result of instability in the agrarian economy? This instability arises from agriculture's arguably maladaptive response to the intersection of structural agrarian change and climate risk in post-apartheid South Africa. While the outcomes will only be apparent in time, the risks are real, and the paper concludes with a call for agrarian policy pathways that are both more adaptive and achieve social justice objectives.

AB Multiple knowledge systems are crucial to understand human-environment interactions of the biodiversity of agriculture and food systems (agrobiodiversity). This article synthesizes these knowledge systems to formulate the novel Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework comprised of four themes: (1) ecology and evolution; (2) governance; (3) food, nutrition, and health; and (4) global environmental and socioeconomic changes. Resulting characterization of these knowledge themes, joined with cross-theme integration, demonstrate advances of agrobiodiversity research, management, and policy amid the accelerated global environmental and socioeconomic transformations of the Anthropocene. Framework results guide the presentation of new data from the Agrobiodiversity, Food, and Nutrition project (AFN) in Peru. These results integrate an emphasis on factors of global change, including climate change. The combination of the new knowledge framework and project results is utilized to point toward future directions for research, policy, and management. The Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework is essential to address the transformative planetary challenges of the Anthropocene that include sustainable development with nutritional security, biodiversity conservation, social justice, climate change, and nutrient pollution. Strengthening the focus on and analysis of the complex human-environment interactions of biodiversity in agriculture and food is vital as a nexus of science, scholarship, management, and policy in the era of Earth systems dominated by human activity.

AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are offered as a comprehensive strategy to guide and encourage sustainable development at multiple scales both nationally and internationally. Furthermore, through the development of indicators associated with each goal and sub-goal, the SDGs support the notion of monitoring, evaluation and adaptive management, underpinned by the aspirations of social justice, equity and transparency. As such, the ethical intention of the SDGs is well founded. However, possible conflicts and trade-offs between individual SDGs have received little attention. For example, SDGs relating to poverty (SDG 1), inequality (SDG 10), food security (SDG2), economic development (SDG 8) and life in water and on land (SDGs 14 and 15), are potentially competing in many circumstances. In a social-ecological context, policy support and formulation are increasingly adopting systems approaches, which analyse the complex interactions of system elements. Adopting such an approach in this work, the above SDGs are analysed for coastal Bangladesh. This demonstrates multiple potential trade-offs between the SDGs, including agricultural farming approaches in the light of poverty reduction, and between economic growth and environmental integrity as well as equity. To develop coherent and policy relevant socio-ecological strategies, appropriate decision frameworks need to be co-developed across the range of stakeholders and decision-makers. Integrated models have great potential to support such a process.

AB This exploratory mixed-methods study uses in-depth interviews to investigate the values, motivations, and routes to engagement of UK citizens who have adopted lower-carbon lifestyles. Social justice, community, frugality, and personal integrity were common themes that emerged from the transcripts. Concern about the environment' per se is not the primary motivation for most interviewees' action. Typically, they are more concerned about the plight of poorer people who will suffer from climate change. Although biospheric values are important to the participants, they tended to score altruistic values significantly higher on a survey instrument. Thus, it may not be necessary to promote biospheric values to encourage lower-carbon lifestyles. Participants' narratives of how they became engaged with climate action reveal links to human rights issues and groups as much as environmental organisations and positive experiences in nature. Some interviewees offered very broad (positive) visions of what 'a low-carbon lifestyle' means to them. This, and the fact that 'climate change' is not necessarily seen as interesting even by these highly engaged people, reveals a need for climate change mitigation campaigns to promote a holistic view of a lower-carbon future, rather than simply offering a 'to do' list to 'combat climate change'.

AB Young people's political agency manifests in ways that are different from adults and that agency is typified by different spatial, mobile, and place-based dynamics. Varied expressions of political agency among young people exist, among them those responding to pressing global challenges that implicate social justice, climate change, and urbanization. Transport is one of the sectors of social and spatial life both deeply affected by and strongly influencing these particular challenges. Among some young people, several responses exist in relation to the perennial questions about how to be mobile: walk, cycle, blade, skate, practice parkour, catch public transport, drive cars, or use combinations of these modes. For some, other supports such as wheelchairs are used. This paper focuses on one of these: skateboarding. The claim that is examined here is whether, how, to what extent, and with what effects skateboarding can be (and be seen to be) both social and environmental praxis. Consideration is given to how to comprehend skateboarding as a means to mitigate and adapt to climate change, to be mobile, to claim a place in public spaces, and to strike a balance between consuming and producing wisely. What might skateboarding as social and environmental praxis reveal about youthful politics, agency, political rights, and protection, and what new insights might emerge from these reflections?

TI Is climate change a new kind of problem? The role of theology and
   imagination in climate ethics
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTHROPOCENE
AB Some scholars and activists assume that climate change is entirely sui generis: a brand new kind of problem that calls for new kinds of thinking and activism. Others communicate the seriousness of climate change by arguing that it is prefigured by the biggest events in human history, such as the moral crime of slavery or the political challenge of World War II. While the choice between these two frames for climate change is often implicit, it shapes the research and arguments that follow. This can be illustrated by examining Christian theology and ethics: Those theologians who see climate change as sui generis tend to embrace the inevitability of apocalyptic change, increasing instability, and an Anthropocene age that calls for new kinds of religion and spirituality. Those who see climate change as prefigured, by contrast, tend to emphasize the continued relevance of established religious traditions, in particular their commitments to social justice and their opposition to destructive political and economic structures. The two approaches offer different frames for climate change and different theological imaginations of the problem. When the question of whether climate change is new and the imaginaries that question inspires are explicit, arguments in theology and ethics are clearer and more defined. Interdisciplinary connections then suggest that this exercise of exploring how climate change is framed, characterized, and imagined will be relevant to a wide range of scholars and activists.

AB Governments and donors are investing in climate compatible development in order to reduce climate and development vulnerabilities. However, the rate at which climate compatible development is being operationalised has outpaced academic enquiry into the concept. Interventions aiming to achieve climate compatible development "wins" (for development, mitigation, adaptation) can also create negative side-effects. Moreover, benefits and negative side-effects may differ across time and space and have diverse consequences for individuals and groups. Assessments of the full range of outcomes created by climate compatible development projects and their implications for distributive justice are scarce. This article develops a framework using a systematic literature review that enables holistic climate compatible development outcome evaluation over seven parameters identified. Thereafter, we explore the outcomes of two donor-funded projects that pursue climate compatible development triple-wins in Malawi using this framework. Household surveys, semi-structured interviews and documentary material are analysed. Results reveal that uneven outcomes are experienced between stakeholder groups and change over time. Although climate compatible development triple-wins can be achieved through projects, they do not represent the full range of outcomes. Ecosystem-and community-based activities are becoming popularised as approaches for achieving climate compatible development goals. However, findings suggest that a strengthened evidence base is required to ensure that these approaches are able to meet climate compatible development goals and further distributive justice.

ID CAPACITY
AB This short article reflects on observations from the forthcoming volume Policy Analysis in Ireland, edited by Hogan & Murphy. The volume forms part of the International Library of Policy Analysis series, which covers more than twenty countries, published by Policy Press and edited by Michael Howlett and Iris Geva-May. While various themes emerge from the Irish volume, this article focuses on only one core question: whether and how the 2008 economic crisis contracted and expanded the capacity for policy analysis in Ireland. The troika of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and the European Commission are associated with policy capacity innovation, but also with significant austerity. Both had a major and long-term impact on public services. While the article documents a range of successful post-bailout attempts to improve policy analysis capacity, it also points to often less conscious, but sometimes deliberate, decisions that diminished some forms of policy analysis capacity. We find economic policymaking capacity enhanced while changes to resources and policy opportunity structures depleted both space and the capacity for social policy analysis. This was particularly so within the equality and social justice sectors. Given ongoing social risks, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, Ireland needs to adjust for a future of permanent uncertainty, or perpetual crises, and should seek to rebalance investment in social policy capacity and to develop systems for integrated policy analysis.

TI Equitable Community Solar: California & Beyond
SO ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Residential solar and utility scale solar are low-hanging fruit in the renewables transition, but targeting low-hanging fruit can only go so far. Can states innovate, reach further, and ignite near-universal consumer demand for clean energy and achieve social justice goals through equitable community solar?
   For the last decade, the goal of mitigating climate change primarily drove the transition to renewable energy in states and countries that took the climate change crisis seriously. But there is even greater promise. The shift to renewable energy holds the transformative potential for broader social benefits, such as wealth-building opportunities, good jobs, health improvements, energy bill savings, and resilience in the face of power outages. Manifesting this potential requires intentional policy. Unfortunately, even in California, a state determined to lead the transition to renewable energy, the implementation of climate action is poised for inequitable disparities. Although advocates saw community solar-cooperatively generating solar energy-as an avenue for all communities to benefit from the energy transition, the state poorly designed its first community solar policy, and the program has been a failure. California is now embarking on a significantly smaller second attempt at community solar targeted at serving disadvantaged communities: the Community Solar Green Tariff. But has the state learned from its first failure? This Article analyzes California's new community solar program and proposes a framework for "equitable community solar" to improve program design, in hopes that other states learn from where the Golden State has stumbled.

AB What is the significance of the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali? The formal outcomes, especially the 'Bali Action Plan', are described and commented on, along with the challenges for negotiating a post-2012 agreement in Copenhagen during 2008 and 2009. The article concludes that the outcome of the Bali meeting is insufficient when compared to the nature of the challenge posed by climate change. However, it can nevertheless be considered a success in terms of 'Realpolitik' in paving the way for the negotiations ahead, because some real changes have been discerned in the political landscape. The challenges for the road towards Copenhagen are manifold: the sheer volume and complexity of the issues and the far-reaching nature of decisions such as differentiation between non-Annex I countries pose significant challenges in themselves, while the dependency on the electoral process in the USA introduces a high element of risk into the whole process. The emergence of social justice as an issue turns climate policy into an endeavour to improve the world at large - thereby adding to the complexity. And, finally, the biggest challenge is the recognition that the climate problem requires a global solution, that Annex I and non-Annex I countries are mutually dependent on each other and that only cooperation regarding technology in combination with significant financial support will provide the chance to successfully tackle climate change.

DT Article
DE Yellow Vests; Culture; France; Sustainability transition; Discourse;

AB This paper investigates the Yellow Vests movement and the extent it constitutes an original platform for resistance to a sustainability transition agenda in the French context. The movement represents a disruption to global climate mitigation solutions that are often formalized at a global scale, and illustrates cultural and economic constraints in providing social justice in the age of climate change. Using a cultural performative approach, this case study reveals the relevance of framing and cultural analyses to understand such resistance. This qualitative exploration initiates a narrative analysis to assess how the universal resolve of the 2015 Paris Conference and the related legitimacy of the sustainability discourse has been further contested by the Yellow Vests and their fractured framing. From the 'end of the world' to the 'end of the month', we investigate the rise and fall of the legitimacy of the French sustainability discourse by analysing politicians' and activists' speeches, historical narratives as well as visual materials of resistance in France in the context of sustainability transitions. Tip of a broader social crisis, the movement reveals an original conflict of temporalities, symptomatic of the inevitable interdependency of socio-economic inequalities to sustainability transitions. Beyond the resistance itself, the Yellow Vests embody an original exemplar for the importance of cultural appropriation within the sustainability discourse' legitimation processes.

AB During the past few decades, many social factors and climate change in particular have had adverse effects on nomadic livelihoods in Iran. Drought, heat waves, floods and cold spells are impediments to a sustainable development for nomads. So far, previous adaptation strategies have not sufficiently proved effective in improving their livelihood. The present study aimed at designing a development model for organizing nomads of the Zagros region. The grounded theory methodology was applied to construct the hypothesis through inductive qualitative data. We used questionnaires, focus groups and in-depth interviews to survey the opinions of experts and managers about optimum ways to organize and develop Iranian nomadic communities. Researchers analyzed the data using open, axial and selective coding to discover the main concepts. The samples were selected through the "snowball effect sampling method" in which sampling continued until a theoretical saturation was reached. To recognize concepts and categories, line by line analysis was used in open coding. The present study revealed how various aspects of nomadic livelihood can affect managerial efforts to organize and develop nomadic life in the region. These effective aspects were categorized into three main groups: causal, interfering and background. Also, the results introduced a comprehensive adaptation strategy model based on grounded theory which covered many aspects of the nomadic livelihood. Our results suggested that this approach is more likely to ensure the sustainability of environmental resources, social justice and improvements in economic indicators.

AB Planning for and implementing multifunctional nature-based solutions can improve urban ecosystems' adaptation to climate change, foster urban resilience, and enable social and environmental innovation. There is, however, a knowledge gap in how to design and plan nature-based solutions in a nonanthropocentric manner that enhances co-benefits for humans and nonhuman living organisms. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how an ecological justice perspective can advance the understanding of nature-based solutions. We argue that ecological justice, which builds on the equitable distribution of environmental goods and bads, social-ecological interconnectedness, nature's agency and capabilities, and participation and inclusion in decision-making, provides a transformative framework for rethinking nature-based solutions in and for cities. A qualitative analysis of 121 peer-reviewed records shows a highly human-centred worldview for delivering nature-based solutions and a relationship to social justice with no direct reference to the dimensions of ecological justice. There is, however, an underlying recognition of the importance of nonhumans, ecosystem integrity and well-being, and a need to consider their needs and capacities through multispecies nature-based solutions design and planning. We conclude with a discussion of the critical aspects for designing and planning ecologically just cities through nature-based solutions and future research directions to further integrate these fields.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to look at how water management reflects patriarchal considerations or gender biases that inflict a penalty upon Mexican women and enumerates recommendations that can both ameliorate water management across Mexico.
   Design/methodology/approach Peer-reviewed scholarly materials, carefully vetted for empirical worth, for the clarity and soundness of their research methodologies, and for their capacity to account for confounding or complicating factors, are reviewed. Special attention is given to studies, found in academic databases such as EBSCOHost, conducted in the years 2013-2018.
   Findings The Mexican state has finally made some progress in recognizing the hurdles women face in attaining educational equality, but there is not yet the universal application and comity that would ensure appropriate levels of representation in all communities. Mexico will have to do more to compel local actors to give greater credence to the voices of women.
   Research limitations/implications There is a need for further primary research to more comprehensively capture what actions women are taking to carve out a large policy-making space for themselves in a country that has only quite recently begun to realize the contributions women can make to forward-looking water governance policy.
   Originality/value The uneasy confluence between water governance and gender within the Mexican context is an area of growing concern to those interested in how water management systems and protocols shape broader social justice and equality developments across Mexico.

AB Objectives: To suggest how public health systems and the health sector can utilise the United Nation (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) to address climate change and other threats to future health and deliver immediate public health benefits.
   Study design and methods: We examined UN and World Health Organisation guidance on A SDGs and other published texts on systems thinking, integration, universality and co-benefits.
   Results and conclusions: The UN SDGs are a set of globally agreed objectives to end poverty, protect all that makes the planet habitable and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social), they apply to high-income countries as well as developing countries and there are mechanisms to hold countries to account. There are three crucial issues for public health. First, a systems approach to future proof health and social justice. Second, an evidence-based approach to aid communication, framing and engagement. And, third, the importance of interventions that deliver health co-benefits (i.e. both immediate and long-term benefits to health, equity and prosperity). The SDGs present public health professionals with an important opportunity to create the right conditions for a better future through the organised efforts of society.

AB Climate adaptation planning is said to be a necessary and inevitable facet of future societies, and is rapidly occurring across a range of geopolitical scales. Previous scholarship suggests that a democratic decentralized approach, one that fosters inclusive participation and representation, is central to achieving equitable and sustainable outcomes of adaptation. However, recent studies frequently characterize the adaptation process as dominated by a techoscientific approach, among expert and elite actors, that tends to obscure or neglect the perceptions and desires of more marginalized members of society. This paper employs a values-based approach to better understand motivational factors for a closed and non-inclusive adaptation process. Through a case study of early, yet formidable stages of adaptation planning in the urban, coastal region of Hampton Roads, Virginia, empirical data among the epistemic community were gathered by interviews and participant observation at de facto adaptation planning forums. Research results document an exclusionary process favoring the participation and representation of technocratic elites and the exclusion of elected officials and local citizens. When linking these case study findings to value theory, inferences are made that adaptation planning in Hampton Roads is motivated by dominant institutional actor values of power and security, those that are theorized to be in opposition to values fostering social and environmental justice. In light of these research results, this paper calls for a critically reflexive adaptation practice, thereby challenging values, assumptions, and beliefs of the self, as well as social structures and power relations that shape adaptation planning.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Social work; Climate change; Participation; Mainstreaming; Rural women
ID GLOBAL AGENDA; ADAPTATION; JUSTICE
AB Despite the direct linkage between climate change and social work practice, the involvement of social workers in addressing climate change issues remains discouraging. This is attributed to lack of exposure in climate change issues during training as social workers leading to lack of adequate tools for social workers to integrate climate change issues into their day-to-day interventions with clients. This paper is aimed at providing guidelines for social work practice in mainstreaming the participation of rural women in the climate change discourse. Social workers and rural women are absent from climate change interventions at professional, practice and personal levels. The precarious impacts of climate change manifesting through floods, droughts, water scarcity, depletion of the natural resource base, cyclones and heat waves disproportionally affect women particularly those in rural communities. Women's vulnerability to climate change is emanating from exclusion in climate change decision-making processes, cultural norms and patterns which confines them to household responsibilities, lack of adaptive capacity, low literacy levels, patriarchal dominance and high poverty levels. As such, social workers are required to enhance social change, through empowerment and liberation of women to participate in discussions on climate change like men. A model is presented based on experiences in southern Africa to provide some guidance for social workers on how best to mainstream gender dimensions in climate change interventions. This would foster social and environmental justice, social resilience, equal participation in the climate change discourse, capacity building and adaptive capacity for rural women.

For example, in the wake of major storms such as Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, policymakers have frequently called for greater resilience of the energy system and resilience of vulnerable communities impacted by the storms.
   This Article focuses on resilience at the system level. It argues that, in many cases, resilience of the energy system may actually reify structural inequality and exacerbate vulnerability. A hardening of existing energy infrastructure may also operate to harden existing social, economic, and environmental injustices that disproportionately burden the poor and people of color. Such situations call for new framings beyond resilience and transition toward liberation and transformation. This Article argues that, to facilitate the liberation of low-income communities and communities of color from the disproportionate impacts they face under the current energy system-and to foster a just transformation of the energy system-activists, policy-makers, and scholars engaged in the work of climate and energy justice must adopt a framework of anti-resilience: An anti-racist and anti-oppression policy approach focused on the greater social and economic inclusion of people of color and low-income communities in the renewable energy transition.

AB Urban sustainability is most often measured using a series of social, economic, and ecological indicators. Assessment methods for urban sustainability typically factor in the ecological dimensions of greenspace, such as biodiversity maintenance, stormwater management, and/or air quality-yet indicator schemas that consider only the ecological dimensions largely overlook the social benefits of some types of urban greenspace, particularly community gardens and orchards. This article makes the case that the process of community formation and strengthening that occurs in shared growing spaces is an important element of urban sustainability in its own right. Based on 55 interviews of community garden advocates, policy-makers, and development professionals involved in urban agriculture planning, this article traces the widespread understanding among practitioners that shared growing spaces strengthen social as well as environmental sustainability, though the social benefits are often difficult to measure. The latter concern was most frequently expressed by urban agriculture advocates who, after involvement in the political process, perceived the need for such metrics in order to communicate persuasively with planners and policy makers. The social values of shared growing spaces, at once self-evident to garden advocates and difficult for them to demonstrate with quantitative data, may be theorized by drawing on insights from sociology: A truly sustainable city requires community coalescence among diverse citizens, and such community is fostered particularly well in shared growing spaces.

AB For more than 30 years, diverse actors in global forest governance have sought to address the justice concerns of forest peoples-concerns about displacement, marginalisation, and loss of identity-related to forest interventions. Despite the mainstreaming of justice obligations into the global forest governance architecture and the proliferation of justice practices across multiple scales of governance, claims of injustice persist. The growing prominence of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation plus the enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) as a primary mechanism for addressing global forest loss and degradation has again directed attention to the justice effects of global forest policies on forest peoples across the Global South. While REDD+ proponents argue that safeguard procedures and participatory processes will promote justice, opponents argue REDD+ will exacerbate injustices. To generate new insights into the persistent justice debates in REDD+, this paper draws attention to the role of norms in constraining and shaping policy designs and outcomes. It asks: to what extent and how does REDD+ as articulated in UNFCCC decisions respond to the established justice trajectory in global forest governance? How do current approaches in REDD+ create and constrain opportunities for justice for forest peoples? An empirical analysis of justice norms in global forest governance, including REDD+, demonstrate that while justice possibilities under REDD+ could narrow, opportunities for norm contestation are expanding. These additional opportunities can create conditions conducive to broader norm shifts in global forest governance.

AB The Adani mine controversy is a significant new space of contestation in conflicts over coal mining and climate change in Australia. Proposed as one of the largest new coal mines in the world, the Adani (or "Carmichael") mine has become a flashpoint between two broad coalitions-the pro-mine coalition, consisting of governments, elements of the media, and mining interests, and the anti-mine coalition, consisting of community groups, environmental non-government organisations, activists, Indigenous communities, and farmers. Based on thematic analysis of news media articles and interviews with environmental actors in the Adani mine controversy, this article demonstrates how each coalition employs discursive scale frames and counter-scale frames to represent and contest the controversy. We find that the pro-mine coalition remains situated within a topographical spatiality, with a backwards oriented temporality, that obscures emergent topologies from their view. In contrast, while retaining capacity for operating within traditional scalar topographies, the anti-mine coalition is more adept at negotiating topologies that increasingly define our social worlds. It is oriented towards a deep future horizon in which the Adani mine controversy represents an opportunity to reshape existing social and political orders. The sorts of scalar tactics documented here are likely at work in other resource extraction controversies, highlighting the need to attend to how scale may be being used to obscure irrationalities and injustices in extraction projects, and the potential for counter-scale frames to help destabilise fossil fuel regimes.

AB Heat is known to cause illness and death not only at extreme temperatures, but also at moderate levels. Although substantial research has shown how summertime temperature distributions have changed over recent decades in the United States, less is known about howthe heat index-a potentially more health applicable metric of heat-has similarly evolved over this period. Moreover, the extent to which these distributional changes have overlapped with indicators of social vulnerability has not been established, despite the applicability of co-varying climatic and sociodemographic characteristics to heat-related health adaptations. Presented here is an analysis of trends in the median, 95th percentile, and 'warm-tail spread' (i.e., intra-seasonal range between the upper extreme andmedian) of warm-season (May-September) maximum heat index between 1979 and 2018 across the conterminous US. Using 40 years of data from the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset, it is shown that most of the US has experienced statistically significant positive trends in summertime heat, and that both the magnitude of trends and the shape of the frequency distributions of these measures vary regionally. Comparisons with data from the Social Vulnerability Index show that the most socially vulnerable counties appear to be warming faster than the least vulnerable, but that opposite patterns hold for trends in warm-tail spread. These findings may be applicable to further studies on climate change, heat adaptations, and environmental justice in the US.

AB Low-income communities and communities of color often suffer from multiple environmental hazards that pose risks to their health. Here we extended a cumulative environmental hazard inequality index (CEHII) - developed to assess inequalities in air pollution hazards - to compare the inequality among three urban counties in California: Alameda, San Diego, and Los Angeles. We included a metric for heat stress to the analysis because exposure to excessively hot weather is increasingly recognized as a threat to human health and well-being. We determined if inequalities from heat stress differed between the three regions and if this added factor modified the metric for inequality from cumulative exposure to air pollution. This analysis indicated that of the three air pollutants considered, diesel particulate matter had the greatest inequality, followed by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). As measured by our index, the inequalities from cumulative exposure to air pollution were greater than those of single pollutants. Inequalities were significantly different among single air pollutant hazards within each region and between regions; however, inequalities from the cumulative burdens did not differ significantly between any two regions. Modeled absolute and relative heat stress inequalities were small except for relative heat stress in San Diego which had the second highest inequality. Our analysis, techniques, and results provide useful insights for policy makers to assess inequalities between regions and address factors that contribute to overall environmental inequality within each region.

AB Ensuring sustainability of earth systems is intrinsically dependent on the incorporation of equity and fairness in the regimes and institutions that govern the global economy. Accordingly, to design effective and just earth system governance (ESG), it is crucial to understand how the global economic system affects access to and allocation of environmental benefits and burdens among people and countries around the world and what are the relevant causal mechanisms. By focusing on trade and investment as two predominant elements of today's global economic system, this paper reviews the literature developed within the ESG project in 2008-2017 to explore the relationships between the global economic system and access to and allocation of environmental benefits and burdens. Our review shows that ESG scholarship has begun to highlight the dynamics of unfair access and allocation deriving from the global economic system, ranging from the direct impacts of trade and investment on environmental inequality and socioeconomic opportunities to the indirect equity implications of certification schemes, environmental decision-making processes and environmentally motivated restrictions in international trade and investment regimes. However, it also notes that critical questions about the identity of vulnerable groups and the potential pathways for more equitable sharing of benefits and burdens remain understudied by ESG scholars. Hence, we call for more critical analysis of the role of the global economic system in perpetuating unsustainable patterns of access and allocation in ESG, as well as research about the local impacts of the global economic system on environmental access and allocation.

AB Urban surface water floods pose growing threats in urban areas, which cause not only massive physical water disturbance, but also loss of human lives, destruction of social and economic infrastructures and disorder of society. The number and scale of flood damage in urban areas will continue to increase in the next several decades due to global trend in urbanization and climate change. Despite the extensive construction of grey infrastructures, many cities in the world remain vulnerable to surface water flooding, especially during the extremely weather events. Since the 1990s, green infrastructure has developed as an alternative and sustainable approach to mitigate flood hazard in urban areas. Despite the great effectiveness of urban green infrastructures in alleviating storm water runoff, there is comparatively little research for planners and designers to determine an appropriate strategy for green infrastructure planning. To address this gap, we propose a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the priority areas to site green infrastructure, based on five criteria: 1) storm-water runoff mitigation; 2) social flood vulnerable group protection; 3) flood sensitive area road infrastructures protection; 4) flood sensitive area buildings protection and 5) environmental justice. The weights of the five criteria are defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We focus particularly on mitigating urban surface water flooding risk and demonstrate how the method can be applied using a case study of Ghent.

AB Our study elucidated knowledge and perceptions of natural resources and climate change by African Americans/Blacks in Washington, DC since they are a traditionally marginalized population and to see if we could dispel the perception that they have low knowledge and interest in environmental issues. Secondarily, we wanted to determine if knowledge and perceptions vary across age groups. We conducted a survey of 491 Blacks in the District and asked 26 questions/statements related to natural resources, climate change, economics, and health. Participants were categorized into four age groups 18-25, 26-40, 41-65, and 66 and older for analysis. We found that the level of environmental knowledge across the age groups was relatively high and largely similar. Our results suggest that Blacks care about the environment, see the environment as beneficial to their health, and are knowledgeable about natural resources. However, younger Blacks (18-25) were the least likely to think of the natural world as a community to which they belong, report feelings of connection to it, and recognize that it impacts their personal welfare. In conclusion, we find that Blacks in the District possess environmental awareness and use local environmental language, depicting the uniqueness of their community. The mainstream environmental movement may fail to recognize this local language, leading to exclusion of vulnerable populations based on a faulty premise that these populations lack knowledge or interest in environmental issues.

AB In social and environmental terms we live in precarious and uncertain times, where not only the sustainability of the planet rests in the balance, but also that of human existence. Many nation-states around the world talk of the importance of social cohesion, and are aware of the threat of environmental degradation, climate change, and ecological well-being. However, the dominating global policy discourse, particularly championed in the West, is located within a delimiting neo/liberal political framework. With a few noticeable exceptions, the influence of neo/liberal thinking continues to flourish in the contemporary career literature where there has been little deep critical engagement with the discourse of capitalist economics and how these impact human and environmental well-being. Often caught up in market-led discourses, and captured by the notion that 'work sets you free', educational and career guidance has been located within an uncritical economic frame. Its energies tend to be directed towards the preparation of individuals to make 'good' educational and occupational choices, underpined by the need for 'clients' to acquire the skills and competencies demanded by employers (and the economy) (Bengtsson, 2011; Irving, 2018). The disjuncture between educational and career guidance and social and environmental justice (i.eec.ojustice) has rarely been breached. In this article, we seek to disrupt dominant discourses of the market that currently permeates thinking in education by identifying how an ecojustice perspective provides a forward looking and equitable foundation for educational and career guidance.

TI Potential impacts of increased coastal flooding in California due to
   sea-level rise
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC COST
AB California is likely to experience increased coastal flooding and erosion caused by sea-level rise over the next century, affecting the state's population, infrastructure, and environment. As part of a set of studies on climate change impacts to California, this paper analyzes the potential impacts from projected sea-level rise if no actions are taken to protect the coast (a "no-adaptation scenario"), focusing on impacts to the state's population and infrastructure. Heberger et al. (2009) also covered effects on wetlands, costs of coastal defenses, and social and environmental justice related to sea-level rise. We analyzed the effect of a medium-high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2 in IPCC 2000) and included updated projections of sea-level rise based on work by Rahmstorf (Science 315(5810): 368, 2007). Under this scenario, sea levels rise by 1.4 m by the year 2100, far exceeding historical observed water level increases. By the end of this century, coastal flooding would, under this scenario, threaten regions that currently are home to approximately 480,000 people and $100 billion worth of property. Among those especially vulnerable are large numbers of low-income people and communities of color. A wide range of critical infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals, schools, emergency facilities, wastewater treatment plants, and power plants will also be at risk. Sea-level rise will inevitably change the character of California's coast; practices and policies should be put in place to mitigate the potentially costly and life-threatening impacts of sea-level rise.

AB Athens, Greece has been in economic and social crises after the 2008 global recession, resulting in an increase in wood burning as a cheaper method of residential heating in the winter. Reducing wood burning emissions is a source-specific method to address air quality degradation, and indirectly climate change, through instituting policies aimed at human health co-benefits. In this work, we investigate and quantify the potential health co-benefits from policies reducing outdoor particulate matter (PM) pollution from residential wood burning by assessing the pollution conditions during the 2015 calendar year in Athens, Greece, emphasizing vulnerable populations. We conducted a systematic literature search to extract data regarding effective improvements to outdoor PM due to wood burning interventions, and get a range of potential ambient PM reduction estimates regarding realistic benefits from different interventions. We applied a health impact assessment methodology and used existing Athens specific data to calculate the preventable daily average non-accidental deaths associated with reducing PM, additionally considering low and high socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We found that the reduction in outdoor PM concentration showed the potential to benefit lower SES groups as much as 13.5 times more than the high SES group, representing an opportunity for policies to improve not only the health of the total population but also improve environmental equity and health disparities.

AB Emerging grid resources such as energy storage and demand response have the potential to provide numerous environmental and societal benefits, but are primarily sited and operated to provide grid specific services without optimizing these co-benefits. We present a four-metric framework to identify priority regions to deploy and dispatch these technologies to displace marginal grid air emissions with high environmental and health impacts. To the standard metrics of total mass and rate of air pollutant emissions we add location and time, to prioritize emission displacement near densely populated areas with poor air quality, especially at times when air pollutant concentrations exceed regulatory standards. We illustrate our framework with a case study using storage, demand response, and other technologies to displace peaker power plants, the highest-rate marginal emitters on the California grid. We combine spatial-temporal data on plant electricity generation, air quality standard exceedance days, and population characteristics available from environmental justice screening tool CalEnviroScreen 2.0 to determine where emissions reductions may have the greatest marginal benefit. This screening approach can inform grid siting decisions, such as storage in lieu of peaker plants in high impact regions, or dispatch protocol, such as triggering demand response instead of pealcer plants on poor air quality days.

DT Article
ID SOVEREIGNTY
AB Since the early 1980s, the Hopi filmmaker and photographer Victor Masayesva Jr. has played an influential role in Native American multimedia production in the United States. This article examines Masayesva's film Paatuwaqatsi: Water, Land and Life (2007), which documents a 1,650-mile run made by Hopis from their home villages in Northern Arizona to Mexico City in early 2006 The run marked the closure of the Mohave Generating Station in southern Nevada and the Black Mesa coal mine which fuelled the power plant. It also celebrated the shutting down of the controversial coal slurry pipeline between the plant and mine that required for its operation the pumping of 1.2 billion gallons of pristine water annually from the Navajo Aquifer, which lies under the homelands of the Hopi and Navajo nations. The article explains how Hopis' affective relationship with place is put into action through the acts of running, prayer and personal sacrifice. It reviews Masayesva's filmmaking career to date and considers his core idea of the indigenous aesthetic, a set of principles that has guided the practical decisions and artistic choices he has made in the course of over thirty years' working as an independent media producer. After a close analysis of selected scenes in Paatuwaqatsi, the article concludes by noting, first, how the film negotiates internal divisions within Hopi society over development and environmental issues and, second, how it engages the impact of continuing drought and ongoing climate change on the American Southwest.

AB This paper examines the opportunities and challenges faced by "Adaptation to the Health Impacts of Air Pollution and Climate Extremes in Latin American Cities" (ADAPTS). ADAPTE is an issue-driven research endeavor that integrates different disciplinary domains to explore the complex nature of urban vulnerability/adaptive capacity to weather and air pollution in Buenos Aires, Bogota, Mexico City and Santiago. The paper also critically reflects on some of the possible challenges to be encountered, along with the benefits to be gleaned, when doing issue-driven research that seeks to be scientifically robust and socially relevant and is defined by such attributes as integration of heterogeneous research domains, interactivity and reflexivity. ADAPTE's efforts to integrate concepts, methods and data from different disciplines were fundamental in the design of a conceptual framework on urban vulnerability. The integrating research question and the use of quantitative and qualitative methods allowed ADAPTS to shed a slightly different light on the nature and interconnections between the different dimensions of urban vulnerability. However, it has proven difficult for us to fully explore the dynamics of urban vulnerability as well as the issues of scale and context. A set of cultural and communication challenges has arisen, not only from the diverse conceptualization approaches, methods, differing terminologies and mechanisms for analyzing and presenting results that ADAPTS has attempted to integrate, but also from institutional and interpersonal issues affecting team interactions.

AB Across the globe, communities are facing unprecedented environmental challenges in many cases because of climate change. The increase in urbanization, the movement of people from rural communities relocating into urban areas, the issue of population density, and a rise in extreme weather are all contributing to these challenges. Although natural and manmade disasters have always existed, the increase in urbanization as a result of the movement of people into urban areas, the resulting increase in population density, and a rise in frequency of extreme weather events are factors that contribute to these challenges. There is a growing field of evidence that individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted by disasters due to factors such as exposure to the elements, lack of resources and services, as well as disenfranchisement, and stigma associated with homelessness, all while experiencing greater occurrences of environmental injustice. The shrinking support for funding such services, increasing income inequality between classes, and cultural justifications for criminalizing poverty and homelessness contribute to our collective understanding of disaster vulnerability when experiencing homelessness. Given that there are distinct needs for individuals experiencing homelessness when affected by disasters, this article proposes recommendations for improving policy, research, and services to address these disparities. Trends in income inequality and homelessness have serious implications for planning and response, and recovery from natural or manmade disasters. As such, there is a need to periodically review progress, identify current gaps and unmet needs, and identify opportunities for improvement.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is an agricultural, recreational, historical, and cultural center and the hub of the state's water supply system. For decades the region has been ripe with political controversies stemming from conflicting interests over its natural resources which all depend on the protection of approximately 1800 km of earthen levees that surround over 60 islands, some of which are below sea level and two-thirds of which are privately owned. This study uses the Q methodology to explore the discourses of the broad range of stakeholders, including farmers, land- and water-based recreation enthusiasts, water exporters, utilities, environmentalists, and government agencies, about flood risk and flood management in the Delta. The results of this study reveal five distinct views regarding the risk of submersion of one or more islands due to either overtopping during high waters or structural levee failures. The findings of this study also elucidate nuanced narratives on the viability of anticipatory climate change adaptation in the Delta. Proximity, sense of vulnerability, values, trust, and views of climate change are the underlying factors in these perspectives. The perspectives identified suggest that resolving decades of distrust among stakeholder groups will remain difficult; however, taking a cultural approach to understanding perspectives may provide an opportunity to open up the conversations to adaptation approaches, and thus fulfill the legal mandate to protect the Delta as an evolving place.

AB Participatory GIS (PGIS) emerged from the contentious GIS debates of the 1990s as a means of political intervention in issues of social and environmental justice. PGIS has since matured into a distinct subfield in which GIS is used to enhance the political engagement of historically marginalized people and to shape political outcomes through mapping. However, this has proven to be difficult work. We suggest that this is because PGIS, particularly in its community development incarnations, though well-intentioned in endeavoring to enhance the voices of the excluded, is inherently limited because it primarily aims to enhance the inclusion and participation of the historically marginalized by working within established frameworks of institutionalized governance in particular places. This, we suggest, has left this mode of PGIS ill-equipped to truly challenge the political-economic structures responsible for (re)producing the very conditions of socio-economic inequality it strives to ameliorate. As a result, we argue that PGIS has become de-politicized, operating within, rather than disrupting, existing spheres of political-economic power. Moving forward, we suggest that PGIS is in need of being retheorized by engaging with the emergent post-politics literature and related areas of critical social and political theory. We argue that by adopting a more radical conception of democracy, justice, and 'the political', PGIS praxis can be recentered around disruption rather than participation and, ultimately, brought closer to its self-proclaimed goal of supporting progressive change for the historically marginalized.

AB Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in high-level, decision-making arenas as a response to global policy challenges. Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS.
   In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice.
   The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research.

AB Air quality and climate change policies are finding new common grounds today as increasing social complexity requires better integration of separate knowledge domains. This chapter addresses the complex relationship between these two policy domains, their scientific background and the related acceptability issue, which varies substantially among countries and social groups and is influenced by social and cultural factors. The first section of this chapter describes the relationship between air quality and climate change policies. Indeed, global CO2 reduction objectives require complex adaptations of socio-economic behaviours that might not directly appear to be related to pollution reduction or to improvement the exposure of citizens to harmful pollutants. Recent studies, however, have confirmed that air pollution and its impacts are one of the main environmental concerns for citizens, even if relevant differences in public perception between countries still remain. This section also addresses the ambiguities and conflicts that characterise communication between experts and citizens. The second section briefly describes recent scientific evidence that shows the possibility of coupling air quality and climate change mitigation benefits with policies targeted at specific pollutants called short lived climate forcers (SLCF). The third section spells out some preliminary research questions on the acceptability of these policies and their complex relationship with individual interests and cultural contexts. Linking air quality to climate change could be a win-win strategy to increase the social acceptability of specific policies and their implementation if knowledge and communication gaps between citizens and policy makers will be reduced.

DE Human rights education; nationalism; cosmopolitan citizenship; populism;
   social justice; migration; Islamophobia
AB In 2003, citizenship education had recently been introduced to the national curriculum for England, and the model adopted was proving to be influential in a variety of settings worldwide. We sought to challenge a nationalist version of citizenship education by proposing "education for cosmopolitan citizenship" arguing for citizenship learning founded in human rights, that recognises and builds upon cosmopolitan values at all scales. Building upon David Held's theories of cosmopolitan democracy we examined research data from young people living in communities characterised by diversity. We characterised them as emergent cosmopolitan citizens, who were negotiating daily their multiple loyalties and belongings. Nearly two decades later, many people are less optimistic about the global political climate. In the face of economic difficulties, demographic change and uncertainties, some welcome authoritarian and populist leaders whose rhetoric suggests easy solutions to complex problems, blaming the most vulnerable (e.g. refugees, foreigners) for society's ills. A politics of solidarity and hope is derided as those who have suffered the negative impact of globalisation, economic crisis and austerity policies are urged to put "our people" first. This paper examines various challenges confronting teachers who seek to educate young people for living together in democratic communities in which human rights, justice and peace prevail. We argue that education for human rights and cosmopolitan citizenship is more urgent than ever. Such an education can offer young people alternative narratives, empowering them to struggle for justice in their own lives and those of others.

AB The global Covid-19 pandemic has rapidly overwhelmed our societies, shocked the global economy and overburdened struggling health care systems and other social institutions around the world. While such impacts of Covid-19 are becoming clearer, the implications of the disease for energy and climate policy are more prosaic. This Special Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices, and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups.

AB Water security is a worldwide pressing social justice and human rights issue. In many countries, water security disparities are evident among households in the same community. The consequences of low water security are well documented, including morbidity, mortality, financial hardship, and social conflict. However, the social determinants of water security are less understood, particularly in urban areas of developing countries. This study uses a mixed methods approach with a focus on household resources in an urban Philippine community to address 2 aims. First, the study examines the association of financial, physical, and social resources with 4 water security measures: consumption, perceived cleanliness, perceived ease, and affordability. Second, the study examines ways in which households acquire and use financial, physical, and social resources to improve water security. Data are from randomly sampled household surveys (N = 396) and purposively sampled in-depth interviews (n = 18). Results of multiple regression analysis show income is positively associated with reported consumption and affordability of water; water storage capacity is positively associated with reported consumption and perceived cleanliness, but negatively associated with affordability; and having a household connection to the municipal utility is positively associated with reported consumption, perceived cleanliness, perceived ease, and affordability. Qualitative results shed light on the challenges to water access, and the role of social resources in improving water security. Findings can inform social programs and policies to improve equitable distribution of water-related resources among households.

AB The United States is in the midst of an historical moment of heightened awareness and division regarding the experiences of people of color, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. Activism around social justice, equality, and identity is transforming society, media, and campuses. In this super-charged climate and context, the stakes involved in courses that examine the interplay between race, gender, and media are high. Diversity initiatives have been a formal part of the accrediting process for journalism programs since the 1980s, and race, gender, and media courses are elective or required in many programs. This article, based on in-depth interviews with 11 seasoned instructors - many of whom had careers in the media professions before turning to the classroom - finds that these instructors contest the value of traditional objectivity in upper-level journalism courses, but they have not thoroughly embraced advocacy, either. Instructor race and gender identity, student body diversity, as well as instructor rank, all have an impact on the instructors' perception of vulnerability or freedom to teach this sensitive material. Instructors of these courses experience individual, interpersonal, and structural tensions regarding the objectivity/advocacy balance in their classrooms. Since individual-level tensions may be a sign of healthy introspection, resolution may not be necessary. Suggestions for managing interpersonal tensions specific to race, gender, and media classrooms are offered. It is also recommended that the inherent structural tensions are taken into account in promotion and tenure decisions.

AB The world is facing severe global challenges such as climate change, food security, rising migration, social justice, or the current corona crisis. In these times, citizenship education seems more important than ever. How can this citizenship education relate to mathematics and science learning? The research project MaSDiV (Supporting mathematics and science teachers in addressing diversity and promoting fundamental values) connected mathematics and science with citizenship education by modeling real-life problems relevant to society. In this paper, we present the foundational design features of the PD course as well the results from the accompanying evaluation of this PD course, which was implemented by partners in six countries to support teachers in connecting mathematics and science education with citizenship education. More specifically, we investigate how participating teachers experienced the PD program; how their self-efficacy beliefs, learning-related beliefs, as well as teaching practices change; and which factors contributed to that change. In order to investigate the outcome of the PD program, we surveyed N = 311 mathematics and science teachers' pre- and post-participation of the PD in six different European countries. Among others, our results show that in general, most participating teachers reported a high overall satisfaction with the course across all six participating countries. They also indicate that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about using relevant contexts, their learning-related beliefs about the benefits of using contexts, as well as their own teaching practice changed significantly after participating in the MaSDiV PD course.

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
LA English
DT Article
DE complexity studies; climate mitigation; social justice; coal-fired
   power; electricity sector
AB The implementation of climate change policy in South Africa inevitably requires decision-makers to navigate issues of development. This paper explores some of the implications of this requirement by examining the case of a proposed new independent coal-fired power producing plant, Khanyisa, in the province of Mpumalanga from the perspective of complexity studies, an emerging transdisciplinary field. Complexity thinking re-casts the Khanyisa project in a whole-system view, encouraging an active consideration of scale, perspectives, different knowledges, and cumulative impacts. In so doing, tensions both between and within dimensions of climate mitigation and development are quickly revealed, a complexity which is theorised in complexity studies as the raw material for systemic transformation. This whole-system conceptualisation also undermines incremental and relative arguments that Khanyisa mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the complex systemic property of non-linearity suggests that the Khanyisa decision is more significant than its power generation capacity indicates. Attention to the conceptual simplification inherent in 'development' highlights what is lost through such simplification, as well as what is gained, and by whom. Finally, complexity thinking foregrounds the multiple scales at which the systemic climate mitigation and development implications of Khanyisa play out. Currently there is very little policy-making capacity nationally, regionally or in eMalahleni to look at alternatives, or 'spaces of possibility' through the complexity lens for both development and climate mitigation. This case argues that new policy processes are needed, which go far beyond policy and regulatory processes steeped in path dependencies and incrementalism.

AB Major declines in insect biomass and diversity, reviewed here, have become obvious and well documented since the end of World War II. Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11% of the world's land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.

AB Aim To investigate the emotions associated with environmental activism among nurses. Background Nursing has a long history of political activism in relation to social justice issues. Some nurses are environmental activists. Design Ethnography. Methods Focus groups and individual interviews were triangulated with additional observational data. The 40 participants (USA = 23, UK = 17) were nurses actively engaged with environmental/sustainability issues. Data collection was from March-October 2017. Data were analysed using discourse analysis. Results The trigger for nurses' environmental activism was a strong emotional response to recognizing risks to human health. Their activism results in an additional emotion burden above which they routinely experience in caring for patients. Many feel over-whelmed by the magnitude of the issues. Nurses in America feel more supported and empowered to be activists than UK nurses. Conclusion This study reveals for the first time that advocating for the environment is emotional labour, additional to the previously recognized emotional labour associated with caring for patients. Encouragement and support from others, particularly fellow nurses, helps nurse environmental activists continue to fight for the health of communities and the planet. Impact Outrage at threats to human health triggers nurses' environmental activism. Environmental activism creates an additional emotional burden above that routinely experienced in caring for patients. Nurses in America feel more supported and empowered to be activists than UK. Nurses whose practice embraces environmental activism need practical and emotional support from other nurses.

AB inVIVO Planetary Health (inVIVO) is a progressive scientific movement providing evidence, advocacy, and inspiration to align the interests and vitality of people, place, and planet. Our goal is to transform personal and planetary health through awareness, attitudes, and actions, and a deeper understanding of how all systems are interconnected and interdependent. Here, we present the abstracts and proceedings of our 8th annual conference, held in Detroit, Michigan in May 2019, themed "From Challenges, to Opportunities". Our far-ranging discussions addressed the complex interdependent ecological challenges of advancing global urbanization, including the biopsychosocial interactions in our living environment on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, together with the wider community and societal factors that govern these. We had a strong solutions focus, with diverse strategies spanning from urban-greening and renewal, nature-relatedness, nutritional ecology, planetary diets, and microbiome rewilding, through to initiatives for promoting resilience, positive emotional assets, traditional cultural narratives, creativity, art projects for personal and community health, and exploring ways of positively shifting mindsets and value systems. Our cross-sectoral agenda underscored the importance and global impact of local initiatives everywhere by contributing to new normative values as part of a global interconnected grass-roots movement for planetary health.

TI Deforestation, Territorial Conflicts, and Pluralism in the Forests of
   Eastern Panama: A Place for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
   Forest Degradation?
SO CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID REDD PLUS; LAND-TENURE
AB Deforestation is a primary contributor to global climate change. When the forest is felled and the vegetation is burnt or decomposes, carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is released into the atmosphere. An approach designed to stem climate change is Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), a global financial mechanism that requires intricate governance requirements to be met-a significant challenge in the developing areas. In Panama, the government is responsible for designing and implementing a national REDD+ strategy with support from multilateral organizations. This case study is built through the experience of a public hearing on the potential implementation of REDD+ in the highly contested Upper Bayano Watershed in eastern Panama. The Upper Bayano Watershed is composed of vast and diverse forest ecosystems. It forms a part of the Choco-Darien ecoregion, a global biodiversity hotspot, and is home to two Indigenous groups (Kuna and Embera) and populations of migrant farmers (colonos), all with different histories, traditions, and worldviews concerning forests and land management, often resulting in territorial conflicts. A major socioecological issue facing the region is deforestation, which is driving biodiversity loss and landscape change and threatening traditional livelihoods and cultures. The public hearing stimulates difficult discussions about access to land, tenure security, biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, identity, power, trade-offs, and social justice. The case is designed to confront participants with the challenges of implementing ambitious, international, and often-prescriptive natural resource policies at local levels.

TI The paradox model: towards a conceptual framework for engaging with
   sustainability in higher education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Higher education; Wisdom; Sustainability education; Paradox; Conceptual
   framework
AB Purpose
   The growing awareness of climate change, biodiversity loss and the wider global environmental emergency has led to calls for decisive and immediate action from all sections of society. This paper aims to consider the question of how universities should respond and what role they might best adopt in current circumstances.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper presents a conceptual framework, the paradox model, which places sustainability within the contradictory, messy and uncertain terrain that characterises higher education (HE). This is derived from the own experience of leading sustainability within one UK university, as well as the continued engagement with educational theory and philosophy.
   Findings
   This paper identifies two fundamental contradictions or paradoxes facing those seeking to engage in sustainability in HE, namely, how to develop authentic sustainability responses within the context of existing HE structures and processes and how to reconcile the demand for immediate action with the much more gradual processes of education. This paper represents these two paradoxes as intersecting axes on a diagram, which creates four quadrants in which a diverse range of responses can be located. The point where these two axes intersect is particularly significant and provides a place from which to navigate responses both individually, collectively and institutionally.
   Originality/value
   This paper argues that wisdom provides a guiding principle for discerning which type of response might be appropriate in any given context. It may also indicate a route towards institutional change and underpin the vision of the ecological university of the future based on principles of civic responsibility and social justice.

AB We urgently need to put the concept of resilience into practice if we are to prepare our communities for climate change and exacerbated natural hazards. Yet, despite the extensive discussion surrounding community resilience, operationalizing the concept remains challenging. The dominant approaches for assessing resilience focus on either evaluating community characteristics or infrastructure functionality. While both remain useful, they have several limitations to their ability to provide actionable insight. More importantly, the current conceptualizations do not consider essential services or how access is impaired by hazards. We argue that people need access to services such as food, education, health care, and cultural amenities, in addition to water, power, sanitation, and communications, to get back some semblance of normal life. Providing equitable access to these types of services and quickly restoring that access following a disruption are paramount to community resilience. We propose a new conceptualization of community resilience that is based on access to essential services. This reframing of resilience facilitates a new measure of resilience that is spatially explicit and operational. Using two illustrative examples from the impacts of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we demonstrate how decisionmakers and planners can use this framework to visualize the effect of a hazard and quantify resilience-enhancing interventions. This "equitable access to essentials" approach to community resilience integrates with spatial planning, and will enable communities not only to "bounce back" from a disruption, but to "bound forward" and improve the resilience and quality of life for all residents.

ID PUBLIC-LIBRARY; GAY; EMPOWERMENT; STUDENTS; STORIES; MODEL
AB The need for progressive change in people's attitudes and behaviors is essential for a communitywide acceptance of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders, and questioning (LGBTQ) individuals. This article examines our role as library and information science (LIS) professionals working in an academic environment to promote equality of sexual minorities by taking community action and creating social awareness and acceptance on their behalf. Findings based on qualitative studies and action research conducted in the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK) help identify typical barriers and challenges faced by local LGBTQ individuals toward self-fulfillment and social and political empowerment. Research participants share their marginalizing experiences that paint a picture of slow acceptance reflected in the lukewarrn campus and community climate of support toward LGBTQ individuals. It forms the contextual motivation for the authors as openly gay LIS professionals to promote "top ten" prioritized community actions of "what do we need to do" and "how do we do it" on behalf of people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Current directions of progress made in the UTK academic environment over a period of two years are shared in this paper. Future efforts are also identified that require extending traditional library functions of information provision to reflect contemporary nontraditional expectations of relevance that include proactive social justice efforts for libraries and LIS professionals to come out of the closet in support of people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Displacement; Climate change; Migration; CO2; Climate justice; Climate
   refugee
ID JUSTICE; DHAKA; LAND; CYCLONE
AB Purpose - "No climate change, no climate refugees". On the basis of this theme, this paper aims to propose a method for undertaking the responsibility for climate refugees literally uprooted by liable climate polluting countries. It also considers the historical past, culture, geopolitics, imposed wars, economic oppression and fragile governance to understand the holistic scenario of vulnerability to climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is organized around three distinct aspects of dealing with extreme climatic events-vulnerability as part of making the preparedness and response process fragile (past), climate change as a hazard driver (present) and rehabilitating the climate refugees (future). Bangladesh is used as an example that represents a top victim country to climatic extreme events from many countries with similar baseline characteristics. The top 20 countries accounting for approximately 82 per cent of the total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are considered for model development by analysing the parameters-per capita CO2 emissions, ecological footprint, gross national income and human development index.
   Findings - Results suggest that under present circumstances, Australia and the USA each should take responsibility of 10 per cent each of the overall global share of climate refugees, followed by Canada and Saudi Arabia (9 per cent each), South Korea (7 per cent) and Russia, Germany and Japan (6 per cent each). As there is no international convention for protecting climate refugees yet, the victims either end up in detention camps or are refused shelter in safer places or countries. There is a dire need to address the climate refugee crisis as these people face greater political risks.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a critical overview of accommodating the climate refugees (those who have no means for bouncing back) by the liable countries. It proposes an innovative method by considering the status of climate pollution, resource consumption, economy and human development rankings to address the problem by bringing humanitarian justice to the ultimate climate refugees.

SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ADAPTATION; HEALTH; IMPACTS; RISK
AB Climate change impacts are already happening through the world, and it is now clear that there is the need for an adaptive response from global institutions down to the local level. Reducing vulnerability to cope with climate variability might be more challenging in tropical countries than in North America or Europe. The ten papers of this special issue were presented during the Adaptclim conference that was held by the Sinergia Project, the CLARIS LPB project, and the GeoData Institute in Asuncin, Paraguay, in 2010. All papers, except one regarding the Brahmaputra Basin in South Asia, present studies from South America. These studies are first contextualized geographically and then are related one to another by a simplified vulnerability concept linking climate stress to sensitivity and adaptive capacity of natural and human systems. One half of the papers focus on actual or future climate change and the present-day causes of the vulnerability of natural and agrosystems. Droughts are and will be the main source of stress for agriculture in South America. Increasing fragmentation of forest of the center of this continent is aggravating their vulnerability to dry spells. Another half of the studies of this special issue deal with the adaptive capacity human populations to system perturbations produced or enhanced by climate change. The studies point out inclusion of traditional knowledge and involvement of local actors in their own vulnerability assessment to increase adaptive capacity. These elements of climate justice, giving voice to those less responsible for carbon emissions but bearing their most severe consequences, allow the particular needs of a community to be considered and can direct adaptation policy toward preserving or rebuilding their specific capabilities under threat from climate change.

ID EVENTS
AB This paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE Social-ecological system; Land use; Climate change; Adaptation;
   Traditional livelihoods; Arctic
AB Reindeer management (RM) in northern Fennoscandia is an example of social-ecological systems (SESs) providing social, cultural, ecological, and economic values. Changing climate and pasture conditions and societal changes continue to transform the operational environment of RM. These key drivers, and resulting transformations including alternative SES states, have not been studied in detail before. Our comprehensive literature review and interviews with herders reveal that land use, climate change, and governance drive the emergence of SES tipping points. The basis of successful RM depends on the quantity and quality of pastures to secure animal fitness. However, intensive forestry, extreme weather, and predators constrain the availability of forage and suitable calving grounds. Maintaining RM by means of predation compensation mechanisms and regular supplementary winter feeding to adapt to changes brought about by land use and warming climate comprises an alternative system state. However, if negative impacts increase remarkably or rapidly and compensatory mechanisms become insufficient, long-term impacts on system identity, and even local collapses, are expected. Although some environmental and societal changes are perceived as pressures by herders, they can be beneficial for other livelihoods in the region. Therefore, our study raises questions for future studies on social justice, such as who has the right to decide what constitutes a desirable system state, or what collaborative efforts to maintain RM in Fennoscandia would entail. Our work is applicable also in other Arctic/sub-Arctic regions where nature-based livelihoods, such as small-scale forestry and agriculture, hunting, traditional fishing, and gathering are practiced.

AB We are currently facing myriad socio-ecological crises, from global climate change to resource depletion to the loss of dozens of species every day. Despite a longstanding and impassioned environmental movement, these problems persist and are worsening. The extent and degree of human-induced change on the planet is significant enough to have placed us in a new geological age: the Anthropocene. Three perspectives are engaged as a way to understand this new era and address our fractured human-nature relationship: (1) political ecology, (2) the ecological humanities, and (3) the informal economy. An exploration of intersecting themes leads to the start of a new theoretical contribution, which manifests at the convergence of theories: a "whole-of-community" approach. This whole-of-community approach is one that is concerned with both inter-human and interspecies relationships to move us towards communities that are place-based, integrated, participatory, and grounded in eco-social justice and equity. Pollinating bees are used as an illustrative example of how to achieve this vision. Bees can be both a bridge and gateway. As a bridge, they can provide a way of (re)connecting human and nonhuman nature and as a gateway, they can guide humans to a deeper understanding and connection with urban natures. Reconciling humans with the rest of the biotic community through place-based initiatives is possible by fundamentally and radically expanding our current framing of the concept of community.

DE Managed retreat; Affordable housing; Receiving communities or receiving

AB Increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events are pushing communities to confront difficult decisions in order to protect people and infrastructure sitting in harm's way. One decision is around managed retreat or the voluntary movement and transition of individuals and communities away from coastal and other climate-vulnerable areas. "Receiving communities" and other low-risk areas where people may choose to relocate must adopt a multi-pronged strategy that addresses the full breadth of services and resources that relocating residents will need in order to adapt to their new communities, such as in areas of health, education, and workforce development. A critical consideration for receiving communities is the provision of adequate and affordable housing for new residents, many of whom have been driven to relocate due to housing insecurity caused by climate change impacts. Climate change can contribute to housing insecurity in multiple ways, such as when insurance rates increase for low-income homeowners living in flood-prone areas, or when disasters destroy existing affordable housing stock. These impacts can trigger the displacement of individual households or entire communities, requiring local governments to plan ahead for community-centered housing solutions. This article (1) explores the affordable housing crisis in the USA and the compounding impacts of climate change; (2) analyzes the concept of receiving communities and the unique considerations for preparing and investing in affordable housing; and (3) recommends how local governments can use new and existing planning, funding, and legal tools to ensure an effective and inclusive housing strategy for receiving communities.

AB This paper shows that a fuller integration of the economic theory of well-being into strategies adopted to reduce the impact of climate change could help to avoid potential conflicts between the mitigation measures applied and the consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels. The paper moves along the path traced by Wood and Roelich (2019) with their Tensions Triangle Theory, but aims to develop it further from an operational point of view, showing how contemporary ecological tax reforms, if inspired by the Capabilities Approach, could more effectively contribute to achieving an inclusive, sustainable, accessible and secure global energy system, that provides solutions to energy challenges and, at the same time, creates value for business and civil society as a whole, without compromising the balance between the three fundamental elements of the tensions triangle described by Wood and Roelich. In particular, this chapter aims to show how the enlargement of the tax area according to new criteria of distributive justice inspired by the Capabilities Approach could serve to increase the mobility of social assets and to develop strategies to adapt public finance systems to the changes produced not only by environmental emergencies, but also by other sudden and adverse phenomena, such as economic crises and significant revenue losses caused by the adoption of non-transparent or harmful tax practices. Finally, the paper considers the proposal to establish taxes on so-called global commons-such as the atmosphere, climate, healthy environment, oceans-and to redistribute their revenue to reduce economic inequalities and poverty.

AB Southeast Asia has long promoted social forestry (SF) in conservation areas, fallow forests, tree plantations, areas in timber concessions and locally managed agro-forest systems, with the engagement of diverse actors and objectives. SF has evolved from early aims of empowerment and devolution of rights advocated by global reform movements, and is now reframed in the market ideal as a win-win-win endeavor for sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation and robust entrepreneurial livelihoods. Southeast Asian states have formulated numerous standardized SF programs and policies that are often linked to broader development goals and priorities, but which have not always been a 'win' for local communities in falling short to provide full tenure rights. Civil society organizations that have provided grounded perspectives on environmental justice and rights have also converged with states on entrepreneurship and market-based solutions. Meanwhile, the private sector actor that is seen as key to these solutions is conspicuously absent within the SF policy space. Within this space of diverse and at times contradictory objectives, whose interests do SF policies serve? We examine the social forestry assemblage to investigate the different discourses, interests and agendas in the implementation of SF schemes in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Malaysian state of Sabah. The formal SF schemes involve shifting or reinforcing old discourses around forest problems and possible solutions, territorialization processes that can lead to inequities in the exclusion of rights, participation and access, and risks exacerbating contestations and inequities in claims to forest land and resources.

AB An under-researched story is how large shareholders (e.g. Pension Funds) and investors (e.g. Export Credit Agencies) whose investments in fossil fuels may amount to trillions of dollars are implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and in particular leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU). Hence, this paper addresses the question: What arguments are used by shareholders and investors in making their financial flows consistent with LFFU, and what do these arguments imply for: access to fulfilling needs; allocation of related resources, responsibilities and risks; and, the right to (sustainable) development? This paper identifies the different arguments used and clusters them into five investor/shareholder scenarios. It assesses these scenarios using the inclusive (access and allocation) development framework. We find that there is prima facie evidence that fossil fuels and associated infrastructure are doomed to become obsolete and hence stranded, which poses a series of risks for (potential) investors and various stakeholders. Three of the five identified scenarios indicate that Pension Funds and Export Credit Agencies may transfer their risks associated with fossil fuel resources, assets and/or related knowledge to developing countries justified by the latter's Right to Development. Such transfers have negative access and allocation impacts-creating, inter alia, a fossil fuel infrastructure and path dependency in the South and amounting to a de facto transfer of a carbon budget along with carbon dependency and related debt to the Global South.

AB Cases involving climate change have been litigated in the courts for some time, but new directions and trends have started to emerge. While the majority of climate litigation has occurred in the United States and other developed countries, cases in the Global South are growing both in terms of quantity and in the quality of their strategies and regulatory outcomes. However, so far climate litigation in the Global South has received scant attention from the literature. We argue that climate litigation in the Global South opens up avenues for progress in addressing climate change in highly vulnerable countries. We first highlight some of the capacity constraints experienced in Global South countries to provide context for the emerging trend of strategic climate litigation in the area. In spite of significant constraints experienced, the strategies adopted by litigants push the climate litigation agenda forward as a result of their outward-looking objective of combating ongoing environmental degradation, and, on a doctrinal level, the way in which they link climate change and human rights. Bearing in mind the limitations resulting from the selective nature of the cases examined, we draw upon Legal Opportunity Structures (LOS) approaches and identify two reasons for innovative cases and outcomes in Global South strategic climate litigation: (i) how litigants are either overcoming or using procedural requirements for access to environmental justice, and (ii) the existence of progressive legislative and judicial approaches to climate change. The strategies and outcomes from these judicial approaches in the Global South might be able to contribute to the further development of transnational climate change litigation.

AB This study explores the spatial distribution of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) relative to sociodemographic and landscape characteristics in Portland, OR, and Baltimore, MD, USA at census block group (CBG) and census tract scales GSI density is clustered in Portland, while it is randomly distributed over space in Baltimore. Variables that exhibit relationships with GSI density are varied over space, as well as between cities. In Baltimore, GSI density is significantly associated with presence of green space (+), impervious surface coverage (+), and population density (-) at the CBG scale; though these relationships vary over space. At the census tract scale in Baltimore, a different combination of indicators explains GSI density, including elevation (+), population characteristics, and building characteristics. Spatial regression analysis in Portland indicates that GSI density at the CBG scale is associated with residents identifying as White (-) and well-draining hydrologic soil groups A and B (-). At both census tract and CBG scales, GSI density is associated with median income (-) and sewer pipe density (-). Hierarchical modelling of GSI density presents significant spatial dependence as well as group dependence implicit to Portland at the census tract scale. Significant results of this model retain income and sewer pipe density as explanatory variables, while introducing the relationship between GSI density and impervious surface coverage. Overall, this research offers decision-relevant information for urban resilience in multiple environments and could serve as a reminder for cities to consider who is inherently exposed to GSI benefits.

AB The rapidly growing physical footprint of cities makes understanding residential landscaping preferences increasingly important for water quality, biodiversity conservation, and addressing climate change. In this paper we answer four interrelated questions about residential landscaping preferences with a case study in Raleigh, NC: (1) How are residents' landscaping preferences influenced by what residents believe their neighbors prefer? (2) Do residents accurately assess their neighbors' landscaping preferences? (3) How does ethnicity influence landscaping preferences? and (4) Do the socio-demographic and neighborhood norm based correlates of landscaping preferences persist when both are accounted for in multivariate models? Respondents (n = 179) in this study preferred a 50% native plant garden design over 100% turf grass or the 75% and 100% native plant garden designs, and inaccurately assumed that their neighbors preferred turf over the native plant garden based landscaping designs. These results suggest that correcting erroneous assumptions about neighborhood preferences may alleviate normative pressure against adopting alternatives to turf grass landscaping. Although landscaping choices were best predicted by what residents perceived their neighbors preferred, ethnicity, income, and home ownership were also related to landscape preferences. African American ethnicity and income were positively related to preference for turf grass coverage. Environmental justice concerns linked to urban vegetation should be considered in light of the finding that African Americans appeared to prefer turf grass dominated landscaping. Results from this study indicate that middle income neighborhoods with high levels of home ownership may prove most receptive to initiatives aimed at increasing the use of more sustainable landscaping.

AB Models for supporting climate adaptation and mitigation planning, mostly in the form of Integrated Assessment Models, are poorly equipped for aiding questions related to fairness of adaptation and mitigation strategies, because they often disregard distributional outcomes. When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

TI Environmental Migration and Regional Livelihood Planning: A Livelihood
   Planning Approach to Circular Migration
SO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE circular migration; environmental change; environmental justice; natural
   livelihoods
AB Climate change is causing people to migrate, affecting developing countries' regional development and disproportionately impacting economically vulnerable communities. Low socioeconomic status and limited political power means that migrants suffer from reduced visibility and legitimacy, which increases poverty and economic degradation. Climate migration lacks a comprehensive and universally accepted name or status. Current policies focus on post-impact scenarios and do little to address structural flaws or humanitarian issues associated with state-aid practices. This article asks what role can be played for and by climate-displaced populations. It answers this by looking at climate-induced circular migration in coastal regions of the Global South. It explores spatial planning and governance best practices, seeing them as tools to adapt climate-induced migration to benefit both sending and receiving regions, as well as the migrants themselves. It advocates a pre-emptive regional approach, highlighting the role that traditional knowledge can play in helping people regenerate livelihoods and increase climate resilience by incorporating traditional knowledge into economic and spatial plans. This can contribute to conservation, and strengthen local ownership of identity and culture, which, in turn, can aid rural development strategies at a regional level. The article builds on existing literature, sees migrants as a source of traditional knowledge, and proposes a three-part framework. "Define - Include - Recognize" addresses climate-induced migration by providing a universal definition for the environmentally displaced; includes environmental migration in national and local spatial planning policy instruments; and stresses the need for community-based strategies and pre-emptive planning to make concrete proposals for the material improvement of migrants' lives.

AB Household waste has evolved into a core urban challenge, with increased quantities of waste being generated and with more complex material compositions, often containing toxic and hazardous elements. Critical systems theory understands cities as urban metabolisms, with different material and energy flows, highlighting the circularity in production, consumption, and discard. Waste pickers in low- and medium-income countries work on dumps and landfills, sifting through highly contaminated household waste and are exposed to health hazards. This paper discusses the risk factors, hazards, and vulnerabilities waste pickers are exposed to during collection and separation of recyclables, based on the review of literature on waste and environmental health and on findings from participatory research with waste pickers conducted in Brazil. We take a social and environmental justice perspective and identify the vulnerabilities and waste-borne hazards of household waste, associated with these workers, their communities, watersheds, and the environment. Household waste, although not always per se toxic or hazardous, can become a hazard if not collected or inadequately managed. Those communities where household waste is not collected or waste collection is insufficient are the most critical places. Informal and organized waste pickers, municipal or private waste collectors/workers, small waste traders and sometimes residents, particularly small children, may be considered vulnerable if exposed to waste-borne hazards. The results include recommendations to address household waste-borne hazards and vulnerabilities, according to waste workers involved in this research.

AB The United States' deeply racialized history currently operates below the surface of contemporary apolitical narratives on vulnerability mitigation and adaptation to sea-level rise. As communities, regulatory agencies, and policy-makers plan for rising seas, it is important to recognize the landscapes of race and deep histories of racism that have shaped the socio-ecological formations of coastal regions. If this history goes unrecognized, what we label colorblind adaptation planning is likely to perpetuate what Rob Nixon calls the "slow violence" of environmental racism, characterized by policies that benefit some populations while abandoning others. By colorblind adaptation planning, we refer to vulnerability mitigation and adaptation planning projects that altogether overlook racial inequality or worse dismiss its systemic causes and explain away racial inequality by attributing racial disparities to non-racial causes. We contend that responses to sea-level rise must be attuned to racial difference and structures of racial inequality. In this article, we combine the theory of racial formation with the geographical study of environmental justice and point to the ways racial formations are also environmental. We examine vulnerability to sea-level rise through the process of racial coastal formation on Sapelo Island, Georgia, specifically analyzing its deep history, the uneven racial development of land ownership and employment, and barriers to African American participation and inclusion in adaptation planning. Racial coastal formation's potential makes way for radical transformation in climate change science not only in coastal areas, but other spaces as situated territorial racial formations.

AB Traditional infrastructure adaptation to extreme weather events (and now climate change) has typically been techno-centric and heavily grounded in robustness-the capacity to prevent or minimize disruptions via a risk-based approach that emphasizes control, armoring, and strengthening (e.g., raising the height of levees). However, climate and nonclimate challenges facing infrastructure are not purely technological. Ecological and social systems also warrant consideration to manage issues of overconfidence, inflexibility, interdependence, and resource utilization-among others. As a result, techno-centric adaptation strategies can result in unwanted tradeoffs, unintended consequences, and underaddressed vulnerabilities. Techno-centric strategies that lock-in today's infrastructure systems to vulnerable future design, management, and regulatory practices may be particularly problematic by exacerbating these ecological and social issues rather than ameliorating them. Given these challenges, we develop a conceptual model and infrastructure adaptation case studies to argue the following: (1) infrastructure systems are not simply technological and should be understood as complex and interconnected social, ecological, and technological systems (SETSs); (2) infrastructure challenges, like lock-in, stem from SETS interactions that are often overlooked and underappreciated; (3) framing infrastructure with a SETS lens can help identify and prevent maladaptive issues like lock-in; and (4) a SETS lens can also highlight effective infrastructure adaptation strategies that may not traditionally be considered. Ultimately, we find that treating infrastructure as SETS shows promise for increasing the adaptive capacity of infrastructure systems by highlighting how lock-in and vulnerabilities evolve and how multidisciplinary strategies can be deployed to address these challenges by broadening the options for adaptation.

AB Only recently has social work begun to grapple with its place in relation to environmental issues. While considerable progress has been made in bringing environmental considerations into the centre of our profession's scholarship and practice, this project is far from complete. Drawing on environmental literature and based on findings of a qualitative case study of water activism in one Canadian city, this paper argues that the concept of community resilience provides both a practical and a conceptual framework for advancing social work's engagement with issues of the natural environment and environmental justice through community praxis.
   Findings In Guelph, Ontario, Canada, water issues are the focal point of considerable community activism. The case study research reveals, however, that while water is the focus, much of this activism is driven by three broad social priorities that reflect ideas of community resilience and which suggest entry points for social work participation in community-based environmental initiatives: self-reliance and sustainability, localization and direct citizen participation, and community.
   Applications Community resilience is increasingly popular in environmental and community development fields as a conceptual framework for assessing and building the capacity of communities to support wellbeing in the face of environmental change, adversity and risk. While the concept of resilience is well established in social work, community resilience remains under-examined in social work literature. In this paper, the author draws attention to this arena of resilience thinking, highlighting its potential for the integration of considerations of the natural environment into social work scholarship, education, and practice.

AB The rapid growth of human population and associated industrialisation creates strains on resources and climate. One way to understand the impact of human activity is to quantify the total environmental pressures by measuring the 'footprint'. Footprints account for the total direct and/or indirect effects of a product or a consumption activity, which may be related to e.g. carbon, water or land use, and can be seen as a proxy for environmental responsibility. Footprints shape climate and resource debates, especially concerning environmental strategies. However, in general, footprints hold a dichotomous producer-consumer perspective that is not unanimously accepted. In addition, the current footprinting system transmits a simplistic message about environmental responsibility that taints the justice debate and jeopardises the validity of policies based on them. Consequently, it is crucial to question who is (and should be) accountable for adverse environmental effects. It is also critical to investigate how the methodological characteristics of footprints shape and affect the efficacy of policies on climate and natural resources. This article examines these challenges, focusing on negative justice and policy implications resulting from assigning environmental responsibility to a sole agent. The article proposes, and morally justifies, the development of a footprinting method that includes justice parameters in an attempt to render fair results that are more meaningful for environmental action. The second objective is to establish the potential of this new framework to promote environmental responsibility and justice while facilitating policymaking. The suggested justice elements aim at turning footprints into a concrete environmental policy instrument framed under the value of environmental fairness.

AB Background: The health-care community has a responsibility to address the environmental impact of delivering health-care services. Educational programmes present ideal fora to confer 'environmental competencies' to future health system leaders, managers, practitioners and researchers. The aim of this review is to synthesise the literature on health-care competencies, education and training of relevance to issues of environmental sustainability and climate change in the health sector. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English language articles on environmental competencies in healthcare in the MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and ProQuest databases published from inception to April 2019. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to synthesise the findings and develop a typology of environmental competencies. Results: Of the 902 unique citations, we identified 23 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Environmental competencies that align with general management skills were most frequent (40%), followed by research skills (37%). Three competencies specific to the environment (22%) were identified: resource stewardship (n = 16), systems thinking (n = 14) and social and environmental justice (n = 7). The majority of work was identified in nursing, medicine and public health. Competencies were most commonly embedded in existing curricula or offered as new courses or workshops. Conclusion: Incorporating environmental competencies into education programmes will serve to raise awareness of, and advance the significance of, the health sector's impact on climate change and environmental sustainability. Our findings that environmental competencies align with previously validated health-care competencies support the perspective that these competencies represent essential knowledge and skills for the health-care workforce.

AB In this article, core tenets and claims of the theory of ecologically unequal exchange (EUE) are synthesized. EUE theory postulates a net flow of natural resources from peripheral developing to core industrialized countries through international trade, a situation which undermines the development of the periphery while enhancing that of the core. The key claims and EUE mechanisms are categorized and discussed under three topics: 1) the structure of the capitalist world-economy, 2) monetary valuation, and 3) equity and justice. The treadmill logic of capitalism in which capital extracts ecological resources and release waste in an endless pursuit of profits creates an expansionary dynamic which draws peripheral countries into exploitative market relations. This peripheralization is supported by 'free trade' economic policies, while nation-states and other political-economic institutions such as the WTO and IMF provide the regulations which ensure proper functioning of the system. Monetary valuation caps it by obscuring the inverse relationship between thermodynamics and economics, in which low-entropy energy and materials indispensable in economic production processes are lowly priced while processed goods which have dissipated most of their matterenergy are highly priced, ensuring that biophysical resources and profits accumulates in the industrialized Northern countries. This EUE framework is applied to the EU's Raw Materials Initiative from the vantage point of policy as implicit theory. By challenging mainstream policies and their underlying theories, the EUE perspective demonstrates that alternatives to neoliberal policy prescriptions exist and policy can play a crucial role in bringing about the necessary structural changes.

AB Due to anthropogenic climate change and the ongoing integration of agriculture into the world market economy, access to arable and habitable land has become an urgent issue within current transnational debates on environmental (in)justice. In particular, the emerging calls for 'food sovereignty' (FS) and 'migrate with dignity' (MWD) show how most vulnerable groups from the Global South, i.e. small-scale farmers and inhabitants of small Pacific islands, respond to deteriorating environments by claiming universal and emancipatory rights 'from below'. These contestations show that the struggle over land is tied not only to the potential loss of physical resources but also to the struggle over cultural and political sovereignty, as well as to the emergence of post-national forms of citizenship. In drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Bolivia and Kiribati, where these claims-FS in the former case, MWD in the latter - are currently being negotiated and fought over, this contribution aims to sketch a 'geography of emerging rights' to make transnational politico-legal responses to environmental injustice visible and understandable. Conceptually, it draws on the assumption that, by now, environmental justice research has paid too little attention to the sphere of 'the legal', and that conversely, legal geography research has been reluctant to analyze dimensions of law and social order within deteriorating environments. This contribution thus discusses analytical entry points from legal geography, legal anthropology, and political theory in order to bring these disciplines into dialogue with empirically grounded research on movements struggling for land and sovereignty.

AB Businesses and governments in postcolonial countries frame investments in wind energy as efforts to address climate change and sustainable development. However, when wind energy projects encroach on indigenous peoples' lives and land, there is often a lack of recognition and participation of these peoples and an unequal distribution of cost and benefits of such projects toward them, which leads to opposition against wind energy projects and often triggers conflicts for justice. Worryingly, such conditions have repeatedly resulted in the assassination of human rights defenders, which further inflames the conflict. Herein, I discuss these concepts based on a longitudinal study centered on a wind energy project in Oaxaca, Mexico, with the aim of exploring and understanding the conditions under which wind energy investments fail to respect current laws and norms, as well as the consequences of such negligence. My in-depth analysis of the actions of the government, businesses, and indigenous peoples revealed a phenomenon that is less discussed in environmental (in)justice research: the gradual and continuous transformation of indigenous peoples' norms and behaviors away from their traditional economic and cultural livelihoods. This phenomenon helps to extend the conceptual understanding of environmental (in)justice with regard to social turbulence, which is defined as the unpredictable behavior of political and social systems in contexts in which existing laws, regulations, and norms regarding environmental justice are not observed. The concept of social turbulence of environmental (in)justice helps to explain how indigenous peoples sacrifice their territories, norms, and traditions to a technical solution to climate change and sustainable development.

AB Over the past two decades, political ecologists have provided extensive critiques of the privatization, commodification, and marketization of nature, including of the new forms of accumulation and appropriation that these might facilitate under the more recent guise of green growth and the green economy. These critiques have often demonstrated that such approaches can retain deleterious implications for certain vulnerable populations across the developing world and beyond. With few exceptions, however, political ecologists have paid decidedly less attention to expounding upon alternative initiatives for pursuing both sustainability and socio-environmental justice. Accordingly, the contributions to this Special Section engage the concept of the green economy explicitly as a terrain of struggle, one inevitably conditioned by the variegated forms that actually-existing 'green economy' strategies ultimately take in specific historical and geographical conjunctures. In doing so, they highlight the ways in which there is likewise not one but many potential sustainabilities for pursuing human and non-human well-being in the ostensibly nascent Anthropocene, each of which reflects alternative - and, potentially, more progressive - constellations of social, political, and economic relations. Yet they also foreground diverse efforts to pre-empt or to foreclose upon these alternatives, highlighting an implicit politics of precisely whose conception of sustainability is deemed to be possible or desirable in any given time and place. In exploring such struggles over alternative sustainabilities and the 'ecologies of hope' that they implicitly offer, then, this introduction first reviews the current frontiers of these debates, before illuminating how the contributions to this issue both intersect with and build upon them

AB How people perceive the risks of climatic hazards is currently a major research thrust in the field of risk perception. In the wake of recent flood disasters in the United States (US) and globally, more researchers are investigating social vulnerabilities as well as the role of cognition in explaining risk perceptions. This study analyzed how people in the US perceive the risk (i.e., likelihood and seriousness) of flooding via a layered analysis that considered several plausible and intertwined lines of inquiry from the risk perception literature. We surveyed 9250 individuals within nine major urban areas, including the largest city and one smaller city in each region. The National Flood Hazard Layer product provided data for deriving their potential exposure to flood hazards. The analyses tested and confirmed several hypotheses drawn from Social Vulnerability Theory and from Protective Motivation Theory: characteristics associated with social vulnerability (older, female, race/ethnic minorities, low income), previous experiences with and awareness of flood news, and potential exposure to flood hazard (local fraction of flood prone area) significantly increased risk perceptions of floods. Self-confidence in ability to cope with a future flood disaster lowered risk perceptions. This study is the first snapshot of flood risk perceptions nationwide in the US. It points to needs for more theoretically-driven research about flood risk perceptions and behaviors, flood risk communication within local communities, and more social and economic support for vulnerable populations.

AB The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) programme seeks to reshape the way we value, govern and interact with forests. Rather than managing forests according to interests in timber, conservation, land or livelihoods, REDD+ encourages forms of forest management that prioritise carbon. While international negotiations are shaping the rules of the programme, how it takes place on the ground will depend on its interpretation and implementation in different places. In this paper, we are interested in how the REDD+ Task Force (SatgasREDD+), an ad hoc body formed by presidential decree to design and implement REDD+ readiness activities in Indonesia, has attempted to mainstream the programme from 2010 to 2013. We develop a governmentality approach to focus on how the Task Force sought to introduce REDD+ carbon rationalities to forest politics. Based on extended ethnographic research, we identify three strategies: adopting and promoting the carbon discourses circulating among global REDD+ communities; making carbon visible and governable through mapping technologies; and implementing participatory technologies to encourage pro-REDD+ subjectivities. In some ways, the Task Force has been successful in building awareness about forest carbon among forest stakeholders in Indonesia. National civil society organisations, in particular, appear to be supportive of REDD+; however, they emphasise co-benefits' framed as Beyond Carbon', informed by social and environmental justice. For others, however, forests remain sources of timber and land, and new strategies are required if REDD+ is to have substantial impacts on forest governance in Indonesia. The Task Force's efforts reveal the difficult and contested processes through which global climate change programmes come to be embedded in national arenas.

AB This essay presents an overview of foundational considerations and perceptions which collectively form a framework for thinking about Indigenous community building in relationship to the tasks of addressing the real challenges, social issues, and consequences of climate change. The ideas shared are based on a keynote address given by the author at the International Conference on Climate Change, Indigenous Resilience and Local Knowledge Systems: Cross-time and Cross-boundary Perspectives held at the National Taiwan University on 13-14 December 2019. The primary audience for this essay is Indigenous Peoples and allies of Indigenous Peoples who are actively involved in climate change studies, sustainable community building, and education. As such, it presents the author's personal view of key orientations for shifting current paradigms by introducing an Indigenized conceptual framework of community building which can move Indigenous communities toward revitalization and renewal through strategically implementing culturally responsive Indigenous science education, engaging sustainable economics and sustainability studies. As an Indigenous scholar who has maintained an insider perspective and has worked extensively with community members around issues of culturally responsive science education, the author challenges all concerned to take Indigenous science seriously as an ancient body of applied knowledge for sustaining communities and ensuring survival over time and through generations. The author also challenges readers to initiate new thinking about how to use Indigenous science, community building, and education as a tool and a body of knowledge which may be integrated with appropriate forms of Western science in new and creative ways that serve to sustain and ensure survival rather than perpetuate unexamined Western business paradigms of community development.

AB Urban living environments are known to influence human well-being and health. The literature on environmental equity focuses especially on the distribution of nuisances and resources, which, because of the unequal spatial distribution of different social groups, leads to an increased exposure to risks or to less access to beneficial elements for certain populations. Little work has been done on the multidimensionality of different environmental burdens and the lack of resources in some urban environments. This article has two main objectives. The first objective is to construct an environmental equity index that takes into consideration seven components of the urban environment (traffic-related pollutants, proximity to major roads and highways, vegetation, access to parks, access to supermarkets, and the urban heat island effect). The second objective is to determine whether groups vulnerable to different nuisances-namely, individuals under fifteen years old and the elderly-and those who tend to be located in the most problematic areas according to the environmental justice literature (i.e., visible minorities and low-income populations) are affected by environmental inequities associated with the application of the composite index at the city block level. The results obtained by using four statistical techniques show that, on the Island of Montreal, low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities are more frequently located in city blocks close to major roads and with higher concentrations of NO2 and less vegetation. Finally, the environmental equity index is significantly lower in areas with high concentrations of low-income populations in comparison with the wealthiest areas.

AB The vulnerabilities and health burdens of climate change fall disproportionately upon lower income communities and communities of color. Yet the very groups who are most affected by climate change impacts are least likely to be involved in climate adaptation discussions. These communities face critical barriers to involvement including historical disenfranchisement, as well as a sense that climate change is distant and not personally relevant. Boundary organizations are increasingly playing an important role in bringing science to bear on policy decision-making with respect to climate change adaptation, an issue fraught with political and ideological tensions. Our project aimed to engage underrepresented communities in climate change adaptation decision-making using a neighborhood consensus conference model developed and tested in several diverse districts of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Our partnership, a "linked chain'' of boundary organizations, devised a neighborhood consensus conference model to present best-available climate data as tangible, place-based scenarios. In so doing, we made climate change "personal'' for those who remain outside of climate change planning discourses and opened an opportunity for them to assess their community's vulnerabilities and communicate their priorities for public investment. Our neighborhood-based model built trust and social capital with local residents and allowed us to bring new voices into conversations around climate change adaptation concerns and priorities. We believe this work will have a long term impact on local climate adaptation planning decisions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper investigates how three aspects of governance systems, namely the policy context, the influence of key agents and their discursive practices, are affecting national-level processes of policy design aimed at REDD +, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. We conducted analysis in six REDD + countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam). The paper combines three methods: policy analysis, media-based discourse analysis and policy network analysis. The paper shows that policies both within and outside the forestry sector that support deforestation and forest degradation create path dependencies and entrenched interests that hamper policy change. In addition, most dominant policy coalitions do not challenge business-as-usual trajectories, reinforcing existing policy and political structures. No minority policy coalitions are directly tackling the root causes of deforestation and forest degradation, that is, the politico-economic conditions driving them. Instead they focus on environmental justice issues, such as calls for increased participation of indigenous people in decision-making. Only in two of the six countries are these transformational change coalitions vocal enough to be heard, yet to exercise their agency effectively and to support more substantial reforms, these coalitions would need the participation of more influential policy actors, particularly state agencies that have the authority to make binding decisions about policy. Furthermore, discourses supporting transformational change would need to be reflected in institutional practices and policy decisions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Nature-based solutions promoting green and blue urban areas have significant potential to decrease the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of cities in light of climatic change. They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning.

AB Stakeholder contributions to conservation projects often occur during the problem formulation stage, yet the role of stakeholders throughout the process is seldom considered. We examine the diversity of state and federal agencies, conservation organizations, other non-governmental organizations, environmental justice communities, consultants, industry, and the general public in the conservation of red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) and black skimmer (Rynchops niger) in New Jersey. We suggest that (1) governmental agencies provide the legal, regulatory, and management framework, but it is often the universities, conservation organizations, consultants, and the public that conduct the research and perform activities that lead to increased research and conservation efforts; (2) departments within agencies may have conflicting mandates, making it difficult to resolve differences in actions; (3) there is often conflict among and within state agencies and conservation organizations about roles and priorities; and (4) the role of the public is critical to ongoing research and conservation efforts. Identification of all the relevant stakeholders is necessary to recognizing competing claims, identifying the threats, deciding how to manage the threats, and enhancing population viability. Conflicts occur even within an agency when one department oversees science and protection of populations and another oversees and fosters an industry (aquaculture or fisheries, or permits for off-road vehicles). Conflicts also occur between resource agencies, industry, and conservation organizations. Recognizing the different stakeholders and their mandates, and encouraging participation in the process, leads to a better understanding of the threats, risks, and possible solutions when conflicts arise. Tracking stakeholder viewpoints and actions can lead to increased involvement and conflict resolution.

ID REVIEWS
AB In this era of climate change, novel nature-based solutions, like the daylighting (de-culverting) of streams, that enhance the socio-ecological resilience are gaining prominence. Yet, the growing body of literature on stream daylighting spreads over an array of seemingly disconnected disciplines and lacks consistency in the terminology and the definitions of the practice. Moreover, nearly all the literature review studies on stream daylighting (mostly produced since 2000) underscore, as their point of departure, the daylighting projects rather than a review of the literature's content per se. Therefore, this study reassesses the literature on stream daylighting with a particular focus on its role, as a nature-based solution, for climate change mitigation and adaptation and for socio-environmental justice. We combine the systematic literature review (an all-encompassing review of the available literature on stream daylighting) with the inductive content analysis (an in-depth analysis of this literature's nature). Accordingly, we investigate all the relevant English-language publications since the first peer reviewed article on stream daylighting was published in 1992 until the end of 2018 to analyze four themes: the disciplines and sub-disciplines of the literature; the terminologies and synonyms of stream daylighting; the definitions of stream daylighting; and the case studies tackled in the literature.
   We develop a method that combines a systematic review of the stream daylighting literature and inductive content analysis.
   The method provides insights on the stream daylighting's literature's disciplines, terminologies, synonyms and case studies.
   The method is adaptable particularly, to nascent areas of study where sources' numbers range between 100-200. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Around the world, many urban districts and some entire cities are dominated by vacant and abandoned property. Former uses of these properties range from heavy industry to residential neighborhoods, and each bears many potential legacies of past uses, including: introduction of contaminants that may threaten the health of humans and other species, engineering of land and infrastructure that may undermine hydrological ecosystem services, and introduction of species including invasives. While the ecological functions that characterize vacant urban lands have been only partially investigated, the legacies associated with their past uses are known to affect ecosystem services. In addition, changed industries, weakened economies, arcane financial systems, population migration, and aging resident populations have left many people living in the midst of this vacancy, with clear implications for human health and safety. Since market demand is weak in highly vacant districts, social capital may be particularly important to protecting quality of life and ecosystem services. New design and planning approaches should be informed by urban ecological knowledge that is synthesized with social and cultural understanding of residents' perceptions and values. Interest in urban agriculture, green infrastructure, and open space planning for vacant urban lands is burgeoning. However, without adequate knowledge of highly vacant districts as socio-ecological systems, design and planning may have unintended consequences for human health, water quality, adaptation to climate change, and a panoply of other ecosystem services. Research questions and design and planning applications require a transdisciplinary approach to address highly vacant urban districts with legitimacy and relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; ADAPTATION; LOUISIANA
AB Climate change will necessitate evermore frequent and complex managed retreats in the future, and drafting policies that are equitable and just for those residents who are relocating will be essential. The USA's first federally funded, community-scale, climate-driven resettlement is currently underway in coastal Louisiana. In January 2016, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded the state of Louisiana $48.3 million to plan, design, and implement a structured, just, and scalable resettlement with former and current Isle de Jean Charles residents. Most Island households are multi-generational and directly descended from Jean Marie Naquin, after whose father the Island is named. Using interviews, ethnographic data, and policy documents, this paper will delineate and analyze the dimensions of sense of place, which, in this case, prompted policy changes dramatically different from standard relocation policies: assurance that the properties and land from which residents are departing will remain in their possession as long as the land remains. For most Island residents, this was non-negotiable. The intangible connection to place-feelings of belonging, lifestyle, family connections, and culture-plays a central role in many families' decision to stay or go. The choice to relocate is rooted in this complex entanglement of identity, familial ties, land loss, historical and current marginalization, and a way of life passed on by multiple generations. In forthcoming community resettlements, continued access and ownership of the properties being left behind should be considered as a critical component for planning just retreats.

AB Flooding exacerbated by climate change has resulted in more mandatory community participation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The purpose of this research is social regulatory floodplain criteria that may have an impact on various socioeconomic factors at the county and sub-county level. Updated mapping can result in widespread changes to the NFIP Special Flood Hazard Area, while no socioeconomic vulnerability assessments are completed before changes in risk designation or subsidy elimination occurs. These changes can result in additional compulsory flood insurance policies, heightened policy costs, and ultimately produce socioeconomic barriers for lower-income residents. The objectives include demonstrating the potential nationwide implications of increasing community risk with these changes to national policy through a case study from Ada County, Idaho where FEMA began updating the floodplain maps in 2015. Ada County was chosen for being reflective of other communities that may be suffering similar impacts from NFIP policy. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was employed using semi-structured interviews, spatial analysis, and the Spatially Explicit Resilience-Vulnerability (SERV) model to assess potential community impacts. Results indicate increased vulnerability in the revised floodplain. Total annual sales volume, employee numbers, industry sectors, and overall community vulnerability are higher in the revised floodplain. Interviews with community leaders corroborated these results. This case study provides a foundation for further research on the impacts of flood insurance on communities across the USA while discussing the social injustice of a national program that is likely promoting the upward distribution of wealth county by county.

AB Purpose Few people living in informal settlements in the Global South spontaneously claim that they are "resilient" or "adapting" to disaster risk or climate change. Surely, they often overcome multiple challenges, including natural hazards exacerbated by climate change. Yet their actions are increasingly examined through the framework of resilience, a notion developed in the North, and increasingly adopted in the South. To what extent eliminate' do these initiatives correspond to the concepts that scholars and authorities place under the resilience framework? Design/methodology/approach Three longitudinal case studies in Yumbo, Salgar and San Andres (Colombia) serve to investigate narratives of disaster risks and responses to them. Methods include narrative analysis from policy and project documents, presentations, five workshops, six focus groups and 24 interviews. Findings The discourse adopted by most international scholars and local authorities differs greatly from that used by citizens to explain risk and masks the politics involved in disaster reduction and the search for social justice. Besides, narratives of social change, aspirations and social status are increasingly masked in disaster risk explanations. Tensions are also concealed, including those regarding the winners and losers of interventions and the responsibilities for disaster risk reduction. Originality/value Our findings confirm previous results that have shown that the resilience framework contributes to "depoliticize" the analysis of risk and serves to mask and dilute the responsibility of political and economic elites in disaster risk creation. But they also show that resilience fails to explain the type of socioeconomic change that is required to reduce vulnerabilities in Latin America.

AB Food security is a global societal challenge, and one geographic region where food insecurity is increasing is the North American Arctic and Subarctic. In this paper we synthesize research on food security in this region; important precursors and early work include reports on the impacts of land claims, the cumulative effects of industrial development and environmental change, and the health impacts of the nutrition transition among Indigenous peoples. Building on these foundations, food security research in the North has followed a path similar to that taken in the global food security literature, beginning with nutritional adequacy and security of food supplies and then downscaling to a focus on issues at the livelihood and household level. Our meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature reveals many reasons why people are food-insecure: challenges such as remoteness, climate change, and the high costs of food and fuel all play important roles. However, the primary drivers of food insecurity that we identify in this review relate to governance and policy challenges that have been recognized and critiqued for decades. Recommendations for future research include an improved focus on participatory research and food security interventions that acknowledge and focus on supporting the rights of local peoples to pursue food security on their own terms. This paper is relevant in the context of climatic and environmental change because it captures the role of shifting political ecologies as increased geopolitical interests in the North appear to be obscuring the rights and needs of local peoples to access and control their own land and resources.

DE climate action; climate ambition; climate governance; Nationally

ID PARIS AGREEMENT; POLICY; SUSTAINABILITY; POLITICS; LOGIC
AB Growing concerns that it may indeed be too late to address climate change have led to calls for urgent action from scientists, governments and citizens. To understand how these calls may be useful requires exploring how they are mediated by both global and national climate governance architectures. Globally, the Paris Agreement architecture is premised on a learning by doing logic that prioritizes experimentation. National governance mechanisms have emerged in reaction to such international processes, but are deeply shaped by local contexts. National systems differ in the narratives on which they are based, their institutional forms, and the resultant interests mobilized. Specifically, they differ in the centrality of climate change itself to national narratives of action and, instead, often embed climate motivations within other national objectives. As a result, calls for enhanced ambition can have different effects depending on how they are framed, and therefore how amenable they are to being internalized nationally. In particular, ambition understood predominantly as enhanced quantitative pledges could yield perverse outcomes truncating the learning by doing dynamic of the Paris Agreement; returning the focus of global political attention disproportionately to a burden-sharing discussion; creating incentives for gaming pledges; and stretching scarce implementation capacity in the developing world. More flexible framings that can harness ambition to accelerated experimentation, broader coalitions, and synergies with other objectives can be fruitful. Questions such as "is it too late?" are useful if they encourage action and learning by doing; less so if they shift attention to future intent over current action.

AB As the extraction of shale gas and oil transforms localities, these places emerge as important, if understudied, sites of contemporary carbon politics. In this paper, we develop a new approach for examining lived connections between fossil fuel extraction and climate change. We propose the concept of carbon mobilization to describe the multiple stages of fossil fuel extraction and combustion that may be experienced independently (as an economic boom, climate disaster, or air pollution, for example) or simultaneously, in locally distinctive combinations - but until now have been considered separately in most scholarship and public policy. We explore lived experiences of carbon mobilization in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, a community that, in the last decade, has gone through a shale gas boom and bust and has suffered from severe flooding. Interviews with social service providers and county leaders indicated that connections between the fossil fuel industry and climate disaster manifested most saliently around housing security-particularly the loss of housing due to floods and economic insecurity related to boom-bust cycles. Economic changes that gas development brought to the community made flood resilience more challenging for some, and easier for others. Perhaps surprisingly, the natural gas industry was a "double winner," benefitting from climate disaster by gaining a reputation for helping with flood recovery. We suggest that while global climate discourse may not resonate locally in communities that host fossil fuel extraction, people make locally-salient connections between different stages of carbon mobilization, and these connections have important public policy and social justice implications.

AB Climate change has far-reaching effects on human and ecological systems, requiring collaboration across sectors and disciplines to determine effective responses. To inform regional responses to climate change, decision-makers need credible and relevant information representing a wide swath of knowledge and perspectives. The southeastern U. S. State of Georgia is a valuable focal area for study because it contains multiple ecological zones that vary greatly in land use and economic activities, and it is vulnerable to diverse climate change impacts. We identified 40 important research questions that, if answered, could lay the groundwork for effective, science-based climate action in Georgia. Top research priorities were identified through a broad solicitation of candidate research questions (180 were received). A group of experts across sectors and disciplines gathered for a workshop to categorize, prioritize, and filter the candidate questions, identify missing topics, and rewrite questions. Participants then collectively chose the 40 most important questions. This cross-sectoral effort ensured the inclusion of a diversity of topics and questions (e.g., coastal hazards, agricultural production, ecosystem functioning, urban infrastructure, and human health) likely to be important to Georgia policy-makers, practitioners, and scientists. Several cross-cutting themes emerged, including the need for long-term data collection and consideration of at-risk Georgia citizens and communities. Workshop participants defined effective responses as those that take economic cost, environmental impacts, and social justice into consideration. Our research highlights the importance of collaborators across disciplines and sectors, and discussing challenges and opportunities that will require transdisciplinary solutions.

AB Recent political events and policy changes in the United States have fueled antirefugee/immigrant rhetoric and an increase of xenophobic harassment and intimidation, which together present a significant threat to the physical and mental health of refugee/immigrant children and families. This article aims to provide an overview of how the current sociopolitical context threatens the public health of refugee and immigrant communities and to describe the role of psychologists in advocating for social justice and responding to this urgent public health need through interprofessional collaboration and translation of scientific knowledge into multilevel intervention development. The case study of the You're Not Alone (YNA) initiative describes swiftly mobilized advocacy efforts (e.g., press conference, webinars, resources development and dissemination) and participatory development and roll-out of community capacity-building trainings to address the needs of refugee/immigrant children and families. Trainings aimed to raise awareness of the refugee/immigrant experience and to equip refugee/immigrant community members and providers across a variety of public sectors to implement culturally responsive and trauma-informed strategies to promote resilience, respond to distress, and prevent mental health crises. Between March 2017 and June 2018, a total of 1,642 individuals attended 48 training events. The role of psychologists in future policy and advocacy efforts to promote mental health among refugee/immigrant families is discussed as well as implications for how other marginalized communities affected by the current sociopolitical climate might benefit from broadening the scope of this public health response.

   factors; Landscape adaptive farming
AB The article substantiates the urgency of environmental optimization of steppe land use, aimed at overcoming the acute challenges of our time, associated with the depletion of natural resources, climate change and food tension. The article analyzes the main problems of nature use, typical for steppe regions of Russia at a modern geoecological state of landscapes. The transboundary character of the territory under consideration is noted and the evolution of its landscapes under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors, which make the study of the issues of rational use of natural resources and sustainable development of steppe regions actual, is described. The attention is focused on the significant participation of the mesoregion under consideration, which has the main share of the area of spread of black earths, in the production of agricultural products and strategic importance for the sustainable functioning of the Russian economy. Correlation-regression relations of the main ecological factors with productivity of grain agrocenoses are analyzed and ecologically oriented methods of increasing the efficiency of bioclimatic resources use of the mentioned territory are substantiated. Promising technological solutions, the introduction of which guarantees the maintenance of social and food security, will ensure the inexhaustible use of soil and land resources and reduce the anthropogenic impact on natural ecosystems, the preservation of biological diversity in the steppe regions in their agricultural use. The conclusion is made about the possibility of increasing the economic feasibility of crop production and noticeable soil-restoring and medium improving effects, new reserves to meet the needs of the modern generation and ensure social justice, while reducing the risks of impoverishment of the environment and limiting the life opportunities of future generations.

   ANALYSIS; MARINE CONSERVATION; PAYMENTS; OPPORTUNITIES
AB There is a growing consensus that current conservation strategies are unable to cope with the acceleration of human-caused environmental degradation. The philosophies that underpin and shape traditional conservation initiatives have begun to shift toward a "people and nature" approach, based on a new and deeper understanding of relational values. With this shift, there is increasing concern about the social impacts of conservation anda need to consider not only the environmental aspects of conservation, but also issues of equity and social justice. This is especially important for marine conservation to avoid repeating the exclusionary and unjust protective measures sometimes seen in traditional terrestrial conservation. Additionally, lack of compliance with management schemes, and failure to consider the social dimensions and realities of local communities have hindered the success of conservation initiatives. Therefore, increasing engagement with social science and a better understanding of humanwildlife and human-nature connections are necessary. Community-based conservation approaches and payment for ecosystem service schemes can provide important insights and lessons for such improved participatory management. Furthermore, the use of social science offers a range of methods and approaches that can be used to improve the consideration of those social dimensions. These include different theoretical frameworks for understanding the relationships between people, society, and nature, innovative participatory methods and more flexible, adaptive systemsbased approaches for understanding complex socio-ecological systems. Increasing and mainstreaming the inclusion of the social dimensions of conservation will also depend on overcoming current institutional barriers such as lack of capacity, time, and funding opportunities especially in the context of marine social science.

AB Purpose
   This study aims to explore the question of whether or not librarians can ethically remain politically neutral in the wake of the 45th administration. The authors take a critical look at the American Library Association's Code of Ethics, as well as the concept of vocational awe, and recommend challenging the "sacredness" of neutrality as a core tenet of the profession. Additionally, the authors describe the history of white privilege within libraries and argue that it is time to actively fight white supremacy and disavow the profession's history of replicating racist social structures.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study is a researched think piece designed to encourage critical thought about long-held idealistic beliefs in the profession.
   Findings
   This study suggests that despite the profession's history of outwardly valuing "neutrality," libraries are not and have never been neutral. Libraries have chosen, time and again, to value white privilege and a white frame of reference to the detriment of librarians and patrons of color. Because many librarians also see the profession as upholding "sacred" ideals like neutrality, we fall into the trap of being unable to criticize our own profession and practices and, therefore, are unable to make much needed changes.
   Originality/value
   This study challenges the long-held assumptions that the profession has taken for granted over the past century. The authors argue that it is good and necessary to question the Code of Ethics, vocational awe and neutrality with the goal of improving the profession in light of the current cultural and political climate.

AB Objective: Social workers can help mitigate the human consequences of global environmental change but need an evidence base for appropriate response strategies. This scoping review assesses the state of empirical social work research on global environmental change to identify an agenda for advancing social work research and practice in this area. Method: We searched 5 electronic databases and selected issues/articles for social work plus a list of global environmental change topics. Inclusion criteria were: (a) published since January 1, 1985; (b) published in a peer-reviewed journal; (c) empirical; (d) is social work research; and (e) examines at least one topic related to global environmental change. From included studies, we extracted publication year, country setting, global environmental change topic(s), explicit/implicit examination of global environmental change, research design, and study focus. We extracted practice/policy implications as a subgroup. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulations were run in SPSS 23. Results: We identified 112 studies for inclusion. About 1/3 of studies examined hurricanes and typhoons, and most were conducted in U.S., Canadian, or Asian contexts. Many described consequences or coping with change, and although more than 1/3 of studies examined a formal response/intervention, rigorous outcomes-focused research is lacking. Conclusions: Scholars should diversify the topics and global settings that they study, and they should proactively engage with populations and systems before a crisis. There is a need for intervention research on global environmental changewith more rigorous methods of outcome measurementby social work scholars.

AB Pacific Island Countries, despite significant variation in levels of exposure and internal adaptive capacities, are often portrayed homogenously as the world's most vulnerable region to climate change. As such over the past few decades, a plethora of projects intended to assist communities across the region adapt to future climate change have been developed, channelled through multilateral and bilateral funding mechanisms and implemented in communities across a range of countries. Whether such adaptation projects have been effective in reducing the vulnerability of targeted groups remains unclear. This paper evaluates a climate change adaptation project focused on food security implemented across two communities on Abaiang Island, Kiribati (central Pacific). The project was independently evaluated using the following criteria: appropriateness, equity, efficacy, impact, and sustainability. Data was gathered from focus groups with recipient community members (n = 84) supplemented by interviews (n = 26) with relevant local stakeholders involved in implementation. Results show that while the project inputs (such as tangible and intangible goods and services) were provided, the outcomes of the project were largely ineffective and unsustained amongst the target communities. The main lesson is that local contextual factors-be they social norms, environmental, or local governance and decision-making structures-must be clearly identified, meaningfully acknowledged, and accounted for when designing and implementing local-level adaptation initiatives. This then raises broader questions about who is currently, and who should be defining "good" adaptation. The answer to this question has ramifications for social justice as well as broader issues for developing effective sustainable responses to the challenges of climate change in such places.

AB The concept of transformation in relation to climate and other global change is increasingly receiving attention. The concept provides important opportunities to help examine how rapid and fundamental change to address contemporary global challenges can be facilitated. This paper contributes to discussions about transformation by providing a social science, arts and humanities perspective to open up discussion and set out a research agenda about what it means to transform and the dimensions, limitations and possibilities for transformation. Key focal areas include: (1) change theories; (2) knowing whether transformation has occurred or is occurring; (3) knowledge production and use; (4) governance; (5) how dimensions of social justice inform transformation; (6) the limits of human nature; (7) the role of the utopian impulse; (8) working with the present to create new futures; and (9) human consciousness. In addition to presenting a set of research questions around these themes the paper highlights that much deeper engagement with complex social processes is required; that there are vast opportunities for social science, humanities and the arts to engage more directly with the climate challenge; that there is a need for a massive upscaling of efforts to understand and shape desired forms of change; and that, in addition to helping answer important questions about how to facilitate change, a key role of the social sciences, humanities and the arts in addressing climate change is to critique current societal patterns and to open up new thinking. Through such critique and by being more explicit about what is meant by transformation, greater opportunities will be provided for opening up a dialogue about change, possible futures and about what it means to re-shape the way in which people live.

AB The legacy of colonial rule has permeated into all aspects of life and contributed to healthcare inequity. In response to the increased interest in social justice, medical educators are thinking of ways to decolonise education and produce doctors who can meet the complex needs of diverse populations. This paper aims to explore decolonising ideas of healing within medical education following recent events including the University College London Medical School's Decolonising the Medical Curriculum public engagement event, the Wellcome Collection's Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian Medicine exhibition and its symposium on Decolonising Health, SOAS University of London's Applying a Decolonial Lens to Research Structures, Norms and Practices in Higher Education Institutions and University College London Anthropology Department's Flourishing Diversity Series. We investigate implications of 'recentring' displaced indigenous healing systems, medical pluralism and highlight the concept of cultural humility in medical training, which while challenging, may benefit patients. From a global health perspective, climate change debates and associated civil protests around the issues resonate with indigenous ideas of planetary health, which focus on the harmonious interconnection of the planet, the environment and human beings. Finally, we look further at its implications in clinical practice, addressing the background of inequality in healthcare among the BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) populations, intersectionality and an increasing recognition of the role of inter-generational trauma originating from the legacy of slavery. By analysing these theories and conversations that challenge the biomedical view of health, we conclude that encouraging healthcare educators and professionals to adopt a 'decolonising attitude' can address the complex power imbalances in health and further improve person-centred care.

AB Work in urban resilience planning recognizes the importance of knowledge diversity to understanding and acting on climate change, but falls short in adequately situating itself within ongoing historical processes that shape uneven urban playing fields in which planning happens. This paper uses insights from environmental feminist and decolonial knowledge politics to challenge knowledge systems analysis to explicitly question and alter structures of power in environmental knowledge making in North American cities. If knowledge systems analysis can investigate and intervene in governance structures through which environmental decision- and policy-making happen, this necessitates reflection on ontological, epistemological and ethical commitments (or `starting points') as these carry material and discursive weight: they open up and foreclose ways in which resilience is practiced. Given increasing recognition that urban resilience needs to consider issues of justice and equity, in this paper we take cues from feminist and decolonial scholarship that has centered these themes for decades and which offer 'starting points' to rethink knowledge systems for resilience. Understanding urbanization as key process in the expansion of relations fundamental to the production of anthropocentric climate change, we argue that changing these relations is crucial if urban resilience planning is to contribute to alternative and socially just urban futures. Against tendencies of depoliticization that solutions-oriented work can sometimes exhibit, feminist and decolonial perspectives locate knowledge-making practices squarely within struggles for social justice in the city. We propose three strategies for those working on knowledge systems for resilience to advance their practice: centering justice and transgression, reflexive research practice, and thinking historically. Ultimately, this paper shows that taking seriously critical social sciences furthers fundamentally new ideas for what transitions to urban resilience could mean.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; POLITICS; REFUGEES; VULNERABILITY
AB Academic, political, and policy debates about the connection between environmental change and human migration have long focused on migration drivers and outcomes, resulting in a limited discussion between the discourses of "desolate climate refugees" and "environmental migrants as agents of adaptation." These perspectives remain dominant, particularly in policy and media circles, despite academic critique and the recent emergence of more diverse approaches. In this intervention, we contribute to the recent turn in environmental migration research by seeking to better ground and pluralize our understanding of how environmental change and human mobility relate. We do so by offering a mobilities perspective that centers on the practices, motives, and experiences of mobility and immobility in the context of environmental change: When and why do people decide to move-or not to move-in response to environmental changes? How do they cope with migration pressures? Where do they move, under what conditions, and who can or must stay behind? This approach attends to the diverse aspirations and differential capabilities that underlie particular practices of movement or nonmovement, reflecting both individual characteristics as well as interconnections with uneven power relations across local, regional, and global scales. A mobilities approach offers a starting point for an expanded research agenda on environmental im/mobilities. This enables academic analysis and policy discussion of the human (im)mobility-environmental change nexus to become better attuned to the actual practice and heterogeneous needs of those affected.

AB Plant-based diets in comparison to diets rich in animal products are more sustainable because they use many fewer natural resources and are less taxing on the environment. Given the global population explosion and increase in wealth, there is an increased demand for foods of animal origin. Environmental data are rapidly accumulating on the unsustainability of current worldwide food consumption practices that are high in meat and dairy products. Natural nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce, and environmental degradation is rapidly increasing. At the current trends of food consumption and environmental changes, food security and food sustainability are on a collision course. Changing course (to avoid the collision) will require extreme downward shifts in meat and dairy consumption by large segments of the world's population. Other approaches such as food waste reduction and precision agriculture and/or other technological advances have to be simultaneously pursued; however, they are insufficient to make the global food system sustainable. For millennia, meatless diets have been advocated on the basis of values, and large segments of the world population have thrived on plant-based diets. "Going back" to plant-based diets worldwide seems to be a reasonable alternative for a sustainable future. Policies in favor of the global adoption of plant-based diets will simultaneously optimize the food supply, health, environmental, and social justice outcomes for the world's population. Implementing such nutrition policy is perhaps one of the most rational and moral paths for a sustainable future of the human race and other living creatures of the biosphere that we share.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and synthesise academic research in environmental accounting and demonstrate its shortcomings. It provokes scholars to rethink their conceptions of "accounts" and "nature", and alongside others in this AAAJ special issue, provides the basis for an agenda for theoretical and empirical research that begins to "ecologise" accounting.
   Design/methodology/approach - Utilising a wide range of thought from accounting, geography, sociology, political ecology, nature writing and social activism, the paper provides an analysis and critique of key themes associated with 40 years research in environmental accounting. It then considers how that broad base of work in social science, particularly pragmatic sociology (e.g. Latour, Boltanksi and Thevenot), could contribute to reimagining an ecologically informed accounting.
   Findings - Environmental accounting research overwhelmingly focuses on economic entities and their inputs and outputs. Conceptually, an "information throughput" model dominates. There is little or no environment in environmental accounting, and certainly no ecology. The papers in this AAAJ special issue contribute to these themes, and alongside social science literature, indicate significant opportunities for research to begin to overcome them.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper outlines and encourages the advancement of ecological accounts and accountabilities drawing on conceptual resources across social sciences, arts and humanities. It identifies areas for research to develop its interdisciplinary potential to contribute to ecological sustainability and social justice.
   Originality/value - How to "ecologise" accounting and conceptualise human and non-human entities has received little attention in accounting research. This paper and AAAJ special issue provides empirical, practical and theoretical material to advance further work.

AB In this study, we empirically examine the relations between trust, fairness, and cooperation within two environmental risk management contexts, one in which the focal issue is of high personal moral importance and the other in which the focal issue is of low moral importance. Using an experimental design embedded in two parallel survey questionnaires, one mailed to residents of Washington State, the other to German-speaking residents of Switzerland, we either manipulated or constructed three factors, issue importance (high/low), procedural fairness (fair/unfair), and policy outcome (risk averse/risk accepting). This design enabled us to compare the predictions of the standard account of procedural fairness, that trust and cooperation are determined by judgments of fairness, with the predictions of an alternative account, that trust and cooperation will be determined by judgments of procedural fairness only when the issue involved is not morally important. Results for the American case showed that under conditions of high issue importance, policy outcome affected judged fairness, trust, and cooperation. Under conditions of low issue importance, policy outcome had no effect on judged fairness or trust but did have a moderate impact on cooperation. Analyses also showed that when issue importance was high, procedural fairness had no effects. When issue importance was low, procedural fairness had moderate effects on judged fairness and trust. Results for the Swiss case replicated the main findings for the American case. Together, these results support the alternative model of the relation between trust and fairness, suggesting that the efficacy of fair procedures is strictly limited.

   Design/methodology/approach As a result, while the president's positions on educational reform are important, the question still remains; can the majority of Whites support an agenda coming from a Black president? Moreover, as a Black man, can the president really be "allowed" to be a "representative" of all of the people? Do many people think that the election of Mr. barna ushered in a "postracial" society; in that he is the living testament that we no longer need to focus on social justice, civil rights, and educational reform, especially for underperforming minority schools? Is race a factor among Whites and Blacks regarding President Obama's approval ratings? How much success can any president expect to have when a significant majority of the population is resistant to his vision of "change?"
   Findings - Based upon these lingering questions, the issue of race has been and will remain a factor in the barna presidency that no other president has had to contend. Obfuscation, control, and fear appear to be the raison d' tre regarding a strategy of resistance toward President barna and his interest in "change." These are the reasons why President Obama's time is significantly spent on negotiating racial obstacles to change.
   Originality/value - The goal of this paper is to provide a sociological and psychological context within a historical framing to understand obstacles to change faced by President Barack Hussein barna.

AB To enhance understanding of the process of climate change adaptation and to facilitate the planning and implementation of socially-just adaptation strategies, deeper consideration of the factors that impede adaptation is required. In response, scholars have increasingly identified barriers to adaptation in the literature. But, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. To further improve understanding of barriers to adaptation and identify gaps in the state-of-the-art knowledge, we undertook a synthesis of empirical literature from sub-Saharan Africa focusing on vulnerable, natural resource-dependent communities and livelihoods. Our review illustrates that: (1) local-level studies that reveal barriers to adaptation are diverse, although there is a propensity for studies on small-holder farmers; (2) many of the studies identify several barriers to adaptation, but appreciation of their interactions and compounded impacts remains scarce; and (3) most of the barriers uncovered relate broadly to biophysical, knowledge, and financial constraints on agricultural production and rural development. More hidden and under-acknowledged political, social, and psychological barriers are rarely mentioned, unless captured in studies that specifically set out to investigate these. We finish our review by highlighting gaps in understanding and by suggesting future research directions, focusing on issues of social justice. We argue that research on barriers needs to start asking why these barriers emerge, how they work together to shape adaptation processes, who they affect most, and what is needed to overcome them.

AB Background: The research of climate change examines social vulnerability by looking at hazard exposure and susceptibility to that hazard; however, disaster-related data are not factored into vulnerability.
   Methods: Using Hazus(R) Hurricane Model, disaster losses are calculated using data from the Houston metropolitan area and the 2008 historical storm event, Hurricane Ike. 2010 U.S. Census indicators quantify socioeconomic factors. GeoDa 1.14 open source software investigates nonrandom spatial clusters with exploratory spatial data analysis local Moran's I score to identify census tracts with high associated disaster losses and vulnerability.
   Results: We demonstrate the importance of adding disaster loss data with the spatial analysis of vulnerability factors, including race, median income, and poverty. A nonrandom spatial component was found within and between these variables, confirming place matters. The average loss rate shows an increase of the number of census tracts that had a higher proportion of loss regardless of income.
   Discussion: Incorporating historical disaster loss data into the model provides a better picture of vulnerable populations in the Houston metropolitan area. Disaster loss data is a crucial performance assessment technique that can effectively assess current approaches and compare the accuracy of other methods for identifying high-risk areas.
   Conclusion: Previous social vulnerability studies in metropolitan areas focus on disaster impacts and recovery operation outcomes or on susceptibility to natural hazards. Our study investigates both vulnerabilities: social and biophysical. This average loss rate shows loss in relation to income, highlighting the importance of standardizing data to compare census tracts that are disproportionately affected.

AB In this paper, the researchers argue that the repercussions of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic are taking a toll on rural women, not as a new phenomenon, but as an amplifier for their historical calamities dovetailed by climate change. The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation ignited widespread pronouncements of national state of disasters in various countries around the globe including Zimbabwe. Subsequently, like other countries, Zimbabwe followed the precautionary measures outlined by the WHO and pronounced its national lockdown to curtail the transmission of the virus. This paper intends to demonstrate how convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change impacts serves as a double injustice for rural women in Nyanga communities, Zimbabwe. The study was qualitative in nature guided by the descriptive research design. Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).

AB The capacity for the concept of climate debt to inform the response to climate change has been underappreciated. International Natural Debt (IND) is a measure of accountability for climate change that straightforwardly and transparently attributes radiative forcing from extant emissions of the two most significant climate active pollutants (CAPs) - carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane-to individual entities such as countries or sectors. Here, we demonstrate how the IND metric readily operationalizes climate debt for a diversity of purposes. We characterize the vast range spanned by the global distribution of IND in total and per capita terms. Then, in a manner akin to carbon intensity, we consider the "efficiency" with which countries have accumulated IND in their pursuit of expanding economic output and diminishing ill-health, revealing priorities and pathways for countries to more effectively convert their future climate debt into income and/or health gains. Next, we forecast the IND consequences from countries achieving the ambitious goal of decreasing their CAP emissions to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050, exposing how the composition of IND, determined by the magnitude and timing of historical emissions, constrains each country's capacity to reduce its climate debt. Lastly, we assess the IND implications from a hypothesized rapid displacement of coal by natural gas for power generation in the United States, identifying the combination of conditions under which such a substitution tilts positive or negative in terms of IND. These applications of IND reveal how the metric can both assess climate debt in comparison to other key metrics and investigate mitigation goals and strategies through scenario exercises. Ultimately, we seek to open an intellectual terrain for climate debt analyses and invite more participatory and inclusive discussions about the consequent political and economic implications of such a multiple CAP and accountability-based perspective.

AB Tropical forests are posited to hold up to one-third of the solution to slow climate change. It is estimated that over two-hundred million "forest peoples"-including indigenous peoples and local communities-live within and depend upon tropical forests. To successfully mitigate climate change, we must find new forms of collaboration that meet the goals of forest-dependent communities for secure land rights, equitable participation in decision-making, and dignified livelihoods in conjunction with meeting commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, 34 subnational governments and 18 indigenous and local community organizations announced their endorsement of the "Guiding Principles for Collaboration between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Local Communities." The Guiding Principles of Collaboration (GPC) are a set of 13 universal tenets which lay out a blueprint for collaboration between subnational state actors, indigenous peoples and local communities to recognize rights, support livelihoods, strengthen participation of forest-dependent communities in decision-making, and protect indigenous and community environmental defenders within the context of joint action for climate change mitigation. Their implementation would advance the integration of climate justice in subnational efforts for forest conservation. Taking the GPC as a point of departure, we explore how jurisdictional approaches to sustainability can protect and enhance the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples (IP) and local communities (LC). We develop and apply a suite of indicators to assess existing conditions across 11 tropical forest jurisdictions toward meeting the commitments described in the GPC. Our findings suggest that while the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities are recognized within national legal frameworks, implementation and security of those rights is uneven across subnational jurisdictions. Participation of IP and LC is not yet formalized as part of jurisdictional climate change mitigation initiatives in most cases, limiting their potential to inform policy outcomes and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Monitoring the implementation of the GPC may foster greater accountability for commitments, as well as collective action and learning to support regional transformations to sustainability.

AB This contribution explores how climate-vulnerable states can effectively use the law to force action in order to address loss and damage from climate change, taking the Pacific Island state of Vanuatu as an example. Vanuatu made headlines when its Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and External Trade, the Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, announced his government's intention to explore legal action as a tool to address climate loss and damage suffered in Vanuatu. Our contribution places this announcement in the context of Vanuatu's own experience with climate loss and damage, and the state's ongoing efforts to secure compensation for loss and damage through the multilateral climate change regime. We then discuss the possibilities for legal action to seek redress for climate loss and damage, focusing on two types of action highlighted in Minister Regenvanu's statement: action against states under international law, and action against fossil fuel companies under domestic law. After concluding that the issue of compensation for climate loss and damage is best addressed at the multilateral level, we offer proposals on how the two processes of litigation and negotiation could interact with each other and inspire more far-reaching action to address loss and damage from climate change. Key policy insights The review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage offers an opportunity to start putting in place a facility for loss and damage finance under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A climate damages tax (CDT) on fossil fuel companies seems a particularly promising option for mobilizing loss and damage finance. Such a CDT could be one revenue stream for a relevant loss and damage facility. Legal action - including cases against foreign states or fossil fuel companies - could bolster the position of climate-vulnerable states in multilateral negotiations on loss and damage finance.

   POVERTY
AB The transition to a low-carbon society will have winners and losers as the costs and benefits of decarbonization fall unevenly on different communities. This potential collateral damage has prompted calls for a "just transition" to a green economy. While the term, "just transition," is increasingly prevalent in the public discourse, it remains under-discussed and poorly defined in legal literature, preventing it from helping catalyze fair decarbonization. This Article seeks to define the term, test its validity, and articulate its relationship with law so the idea can meet its potential.
   The Article is the first to disambiguate and assess two main rhetorical usages of "just transition." I argue that legal scholars should recognize it as a term of art that evolved in the labor movement, first known as a "superfund for workers." In the climate change context, I therefore define a just transition as the principle of easing the burden decarbonization poses to those who depend on high-carbon industries. This definition provides clarity and can help law engage with fields that already recognize just transitions as a labor concept.
   I argue further that the labor-driven just transition concept is both justified and essential in light of today's deep political polarization and "jobs-versus-environment" tensions. First, it can incorporate much-needed economic equity considerations into environmental decisionmaking. Second, it can inform a modernized alternative to the environmental law apparatus, which must evolve to transcend disciplines. Third, it offers an avenue for climate reform through coalition-building between labor and environmental interests. I offer guidance for effectuating the principle by synthesizing instances of its embodiment in law in the Trade Act of 1974 (assisting manufacturing communities), the President's Northwest Forest Plan (assisting timber communities), the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (assisting tobacco farmers), and the POWER Initiative (assisting coal communities), among other examples.

AB Urban population growth is leading to growing concerns about land use change, green infrastructure, and the loss of beneficial ecosystem services. Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3 million to 5.6 million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Recent policy changes highlight the need for citizens to take adaptive actions to reduce flood-related impacts. Here, we argue that these changes represent a wider behavioral turn in flood risk management (FRM). The behavioral turn is based on three fundamental assumptions: first, that the motivations of citizens to take adaptive actions can be well understood so that these motivations can be targeted in the practice of FRM; second, that private adaptive measures and actions are effective in reducing flood risk; and third, that individuals have the capacities to implement such measures. We assess the extent to which the assumptions can be supported by empirical evidence. We do this by engaging with three intellectual catchments. We turn to research by psychologists and other behavioral scientists which focus on the sociopsychological factors which influence individual motivations (Assumption 1). We engage with economists, engineers, and quantitative risk analysts who explore the extent to which individuals can reduce flood related impacts by quantifying the effectiveness and efficiency of household-level adaptive measures (Assumption 2). We converse with human geographers and sociologists who explore the types of capacities households require to adapt to and cope with threatening events (Assumption 3). We believe that an investigation of the behavioral turn is important because if the outlined assumptions do not hold, there is a risk of creating and strengthening inequalities in FRM. Therefore, we outline the current intellectual and empirical knowledge as well as future research needs. Generally, we argue that more collaboration across intellectual catchments is needed, that future research should be more theoretically grounded and become methodologically more rigorous and at the same time focus more explicitly on the normative underpinnings of the behavioral turn.

AB The International Society of Biometeorology (ISB) has covered significant breadth and depth addressing fundamental and applied societal and environmental challenges in the last 60 years. Biometeorology is an interdisciplinary science connecting living organisms to their environment, but there is very little understanding of the existence and placement of this discipline within formal educational systems and institutions. It is thus difficult to project the ability of members of the biometeorological community-especially the biometeorologists of the future-to help solve global challenges. In this paper, we ask: At present, how we are training people to understand and think about biometeorology? We also ask: What are the current tools and opportunities in which biometeorologists might address future challenges? Finally, we connect these two questions by asking: What type of new training and skill development is needed to better educate "biometeorologists of the future" to more effectively address the future challenges? To answer these questions, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence from an educationally focused workshop attended by new professionals in biometeorology. We identify four common themes (thermal comfort and exposures, agricultural productivity, air quality, and urbanization) that biometeorologists are currently studying and that we expect to be important in the future based on their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Review of recent literature within each of these thematic areas highlights a wide array of skill sets and perspectives that biometeorologists are already using. Current and new professionals within the ISB have noted highly varying and largely improvised educational pathways into the field. While variability and improvisation may be assets in promoting flexibility, adaptation, and interdisciplinarity, the lack of formal training in biometeorology raises concerns about the extent to which continuing generations of scholars will identify and engage with the community of scholarship that the ISB has developed over its 60-year history.

AB OBJECTIVE: We examined the distribution of heat risk-related land cover (HRRLC) characteristics across racial/ethnic groups and degrees of residential segregation.
   METHODS: Block group-level tree canopy and impervious surface estimates were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset for densely populated urban areas of the United States and Puerto Rico, and linked to demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census. Racial/ethnic groups in a given block group were considered to live in HRRLC if at least half their population experienced the absence of tree canopy and at least half of the ground was covered by impervious surface (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, roads). Residential segregation was characterized for metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico using the multigroup dissimilarity index.
   RESULTS: After adjustment for ecoregion and precipitation, holding segregation level constant, non-Hispanic blacks were 52% more likely (95% CI: 37%, 69%), non-Hispanic Asians 32% more likely (95% CI: 18%, 47%), and Hispanics 21% more likely (95% CI: 8%, 35%) to live in HRRLC conditions compared with non-Hispanic whites. Within each racial/ethnic group, HRRLC conditions increased with increasing degrees of metropolitan area-level segregation. Further adjustment for home ownership and poverty did not substantially alter these results, but adjustment for population density and metropolitan area population attenuated the segregation effects, suggesting a mediating or confounding role.
   CONCLUSIONS: Land cover was associated with segregation within each racial/ethnic group, which may be explained partly by the concentration of racial/ethnic minorities into densely populated neighborhoods within larger, more segregated cities. In anticipation of greater frequency and duration of extreme heat events, climate change adaptation strategies, such as planting trees in urban areas, should explicitly incorporate an environmental justice framework that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HRRLC.

AB Pollen allergies are one of the most common health problems in the United States and over 20% of Americans are sensitized to the pollen produced by common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L). Despite the importance of allergenic pollen to public health, no research has linked land use and plant populations to spatial heterogeneity in airborne pollen concentrations. In order to quantify these relationships and elucidate the processes which lead to pollen exposure, we surveyed ragweed stem density in Detroit (Michigan, USA) as a function of land use. We then deployed 34 pollen collectors throughout the city and recorded ragweed cover in the immediate vicinity of each pollen collector. We found that ragweed populations were highest in vacant lots, a common land cover type in Detroit. Because ragweed population density was so strongly correlated to vacant lots, for which spatially explicit data were available, we were able to investigate whether observed ragweed pollen concentrations were a function of land use at the spatial scales of 10 m and I km. Both relationships were significant, and the combination of these two variables predicts a large portion of airborne ragweed pollen concentrations (R-2 = 0.48). These results emphasize the important role of pollen production within the urban environment and show that management of allergenic pollen producing plants must be considered at multiple spatial scales. Our findings also demonstrate that there is too much spatial heterogeneity for a pollen collector at any given site to portray the allergenic pollen load experienced by different individuals within the same city. Finally, we discuss how spatial correlations between socio-economic status, vacant lots, and ragweed could help to explain the disproportionate amount of allergies and ragweed sensitization experienced bylaw income and minority populations in Detroit.

AB Historically, energy and climate research have failed to fully integrate research from the social sciences. This is problematic as the development of energy systems and the rapid acceleration of climate change are directly tied to human activity. When the social sciences are incorporated in energy and climate research, their scope is frequently economically oriented. Methodological approaches remain frequently quantitative in nature. While important, these approaches cannot fully capture the nuances of power, inequality, and justice within decisionmaking processes that create and constitute our energy systems and subsequent climate change impacts and outcomes. As energy decisions and policies continue to increasingly shape the extent to which the world is impacted by climate change, we must think precisely about the complexity of identity and who is involved in energy decisions; who benefits from, and who is burdened by particular sets of energy decisions and the impacts of climate change. In addition, we must examine how these burdens and benefits manifest differently based on individual and group identities. To ignore these questions creates a research field where social actors and organizations remain decoupled from their role and responsibilities in the construction of and participation in these energy systems; where the embeddedness of a system is taken for granted, remains unscrutinized and unchallenged, and acts as a path-dependent barrier to the envisioning and building of an alternative energy future. In order to strengthen energy and climate change research and policy we must engage in research methods that can better account for underlying issues of power and justice within the decisionmaking processes across multiple socio-political scales. More specifically in this paper, I argue that using qualitative methodological tools rooted in intersectional feminist theory, such as a multi-sited critical policy ehtnography, are a crucial way to do so.

AB Coastal urban areas have dramatically increased during the last decades, however, coastal research integrating the impacts and challenges facing urban areas is still scarce. To examine research advances and critical gaps, a review of the literature on coastal urban ecology was performed. Articles were selected following a structured decision tree and data were classified into study disciplines, approaches, type of analysis, main research objectives, and Pickett's paradigms in-, of-, and for- the city, among other categories. From a total of 237 publications, results show that most of the research comes from the USA, China, and Australia, and has been carried out mostly in large cities with populations between 1 and 5 million people. Focus has been placed on ecological studies, spatial and quantitative analysis and pollution in coastal urban areas. Most of the studies on urban ecology in coastal zones were developed at nearshore terrestrial environments and only 22.36% included the marine ecosystem. Urban ecological studies in coastal areas have mainly been carried out under the paradigm in the city with a focus on the disciplines of biology and ecology. Results suggest a series of disciplinary, geographical, and approach biases which can present a number of risks. Foremost among these is a lack of knowledge on social dimensions which can impact on sustainability. A key risk relates to the fact that lessons and recommendations of research are mainly from developed countries and large cities which might have different institutional, planning and cultural settings compared to developing and mid-income countries. Scientific research on coastal urban areas needs to diversify toward an ecology of and for the cities, in order to support coastal development in a diversity of countries and settings.

AB The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves due to human-caused climate change puts historically underserved populations in a heightened state of precarity, as studies observe that vulnerable communities-especially those within urban areas in the United States-are disproportionately exposed to extreme heat. Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between "redlining", or the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 degrees C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6 degrees C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.

AB Transboundary collaboration between the United States (US) and Mexico in the Colorado River Basin has heightened in recent years, as climate change, population growth, and overallocation threaten the long-term stability of the region. Through a combination of document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, we examine patterns of change in the governance of the Colorado River, as the US and Mexico navigate socioeconomic, cultural, and political asymmetries to jointly share water over the past two decades. We ask: What key events and environmental agreements have influenced transboundary water governance in the Colorado River over the past 20 years? We draw on the rich scholarship on transboundary water governance, especially around international river basin organizations, to uncover patterns of engagement and collaboration over time. We focus on the binational scale with an eye to study governance at multiple scales including interactions and impacts at the national and subnational scales. Our findings illustrate how Mexico's role has evolved from a narrow one following a strict interpretation of the 1944 Treaty toward a more creative partnership between the US and Mexico demonstrated in binational negotiations and the creation of joint solutions to emerging challenges around water conservation and ecological restoration. We find transboundary water governance in the basin is influenced by both long-term and short-term contextual changes that can inform strategies key actors employ to bolster institutional resilience and take advantage of opportunities for transformative change. Further, we find that the evolution of the binational relationship is reflected in changes in the negotiation process and structure, which highlights the importance of trust and relationship building, transparency, joint fact-finding, and information sharing to foster collaboration. However, we also find uneven institutionalization of stakeholder participation and transparency in engagement patterns that may ultimately, serve to hinder governance and cooperation in the basin.

ID MANAGED RETREAT; POLICIES; HEALTH; VULNERABILITY; FLOODS
AB As climate change accelerates the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, damage to public and private property is also increasing, putting exorbitant strain on governments and communities. Societies across the world are working to adapt to climate change, but climate adaptation is currently inadequate to meet the needs of the people left increasingly vulnerable and the places that risk being irreversibly changed or destroyed. One tactic of climate adaptation is strategic retreat, sometimes referred to as managed retreat. Strategic retreat is the process by which the government or another entity purchases (buys out) developed properties that are at risk of destruction or have been destroyed by natural disasters. The structure is most often demolished, and the land is placed under a permanent easement to prevent future development. What happens next is dependent on the entities involved in the buyouts, and can range from derelict, vacant lots to full restoration of ecosystems and their abilities to mitigate flood damage. Sometimes recreational amenities, such as trails or park infrastructure, are prioritized and funded as well. Conservation organizations can leverage their expertise in conservation planning, land acquisition and restoration, policy advocacy, and partnership development to improve the implementation of strategic retreat so that nature and people can thrive in the long term. In this policy paper, we review ways that conservation organizations have and can continue to engage in buyout processes to ensure positive outcomes for communities and nature. Conservation organizations must also evolve their approaches to climate adaptation to integrate equity and redress historical injustices in land use, and contribute towards improving strategic retreat for a more just and resilient future across disaster-prone communities. This work focuses on the context of disasters and climate adaptation in the USA, though many of the principles presented are applicable around the world.

AB Agricultural and reproductive technologies ostensibly represent opposing poles within discourses on population growth: one aims to 'feed the world,' while the other seeks to limit the number of mouths there are to feed. There is, however, an urgent need to critically interrogate new discourses linking population size with climate change and promoting agricultural and reproductive technologies as a means to address associated problems. This article analyses the specific discourses produced by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in relation to these 'population technologies' and 'climate-smart' agriculture in particular. Drawing on concepts and approaches developed by Black, postcolonial and Marxist feminists including intersectionality, racial capitalism, social reproduction, and reproductive and environmental justice, we explore how within these discourses, the 'geo-populationism' of the BMGF's climate-smart agriculture initiatives, like the 'demo-populationism' of its family planning interventions, mobilises neoliberal notions of empowerment, productivity and innovation. Not only do these populationist discourses reinforce neoliberal framings and policies which extend existing regimes of racialised and gendered socio-spatial inequality, but they also underwrite global capital accumulation through new science and technologies. The BMGF's representations of its climate-smart agriculture initiatives offer the opportunity to understand how threats of climate change are mobilised to reanimate and repackage the Malthusian disequilibrium between human fertility and agricultural productivity. Drawing upon our readings of these discourses, we critically propose the concept of 'necro-populationism' to refer to processes that target racialised and gendered populations for dispossession, toxification, slow death and embodied violence, even while direct accountability for the effects of these changes is dispersed. We also identify a need for further research which will not only trace the ways in which the BMGF's global policies are materialised, spatialised, reproduced and reoriented by multiple actors in local contexts, but will also recognise and affirm the diverse forms through which these 'necro-populationist' processes are disavowed and resisted.

AB Food waste has emerged as one of the world's most critical issues, as record levels of food waste have resulted in negative outcomes for food security, land use, and methane production associated with climate change. As key institutions in the world's food system, retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers have taken steps to reduce food waste. Yet, while food corporations promote their food waste programs as part of their broader green sustainability initiatives, it is unclear how and why they have developed these initiatives. To fill this research gap, this study examines a US company's food waste reduction programs as a case study. To this end, this study utilises interview data of key stakeholders to examine the ways that food waste is produced, regulated, and reused by food corporations. Research findings point to some positive outcomes, such as the transformation of food waste into alternative energy and increased efficiency in food donation systems. Yet, these positive outcomes may be overshadowed by corporate priorities which privilege profitability, brand enhancement, and short-term high-visibility solutions. This research highlights that the broad and somewhat diffuse definition of sustainability may allow corporations to highlight narrow, company-specific technical fixes rather than do the hard work associated with reducing food waste in their supply chains. Moreover, data suggest that many food corporations use the sustainability trope as a way to ensure that they are recognised as legitimate, ethical, and profitable companies. Thus, while some argue that sustainable development institutionalises important environmental practices into the market, evidence from this study suggests that these corporate practices may be evidence of neoliberal environmental governance which is determined by market logics rather than environmental or social justice. In this way, corporate profitability determines how sustainability is defined, when and where sustainability is implemented, and how sustainability is to be measured.

AB The Circular Economy is gaining traction in the European Union and all over the world as a transition away from the extractive and exploitative linear economy. In HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, the cultural value of aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina is a philosophy describing a set of values grounded in a relationship of kinship between people and the environment. Aloha Modified Letter Turned CommaAina structured centuries of sustainability and it has evolved over generations to frame community responses to crucial issues today, such as climate change, oligopolistic markets, and contemporary land management. This paper sits at the intersection of cross-disciplinary collaboration, sustainability, and sustainable development. Participative moderate observations and intentional cross-cultural exchanges of knowledge over five years between scholars and experts in the major fields of indigenous Hawaiian knowledge and industrial ecology inspired the concepts explored in this paper, which address the question of how aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina and the Circular Economy can engage with each other in the collective effort to combat climate change, guide sustainable development efforts, and transition societies toward sustainability. Extensive literature reviews and insight gained through site visits to sustainability projects inform the discussion of best practices from opposite parts of the globe-HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai and Germany-to put into conversation two worldviews and present resulting implications and lessons learned. Essential findings describe the benefits of knowledge exchange between members of global practitioner networks. By shifting expert and participant roles according to which projects are being observed, cross-cultural characteristics can be explored at a deeper level, which allow participants to employ best practices to their respective theories. The Circular Economy's engagement with indigenous knowledge systems is an opportunity to ally and produce solutions to the challenges associated with changing the linear economy while addressing both environmental and social justice issues.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROPOWER; BENEFITS
AB Hydropower is often termed "green energy" and proffered as an alternative to polluting coal-generated electricity for burgeoning cities and energy-insecure rural areas. India is the third largest coal producer in the world; it is projected to be the largest coal consumer by 2050. In the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India, over 450 hydroelectric power schemes are proposed or are under development. Hydropower projects ranging from micro hydro (run-of-the-river systems with generating capacity up to 100 kW) to large reservoirs (storage systems up to 2000 MW) such as the Tehri Dam are in various stages of planning, construction or implementation. Run-of-the-river hydropower projects are being developed in Uttarakhand in order to avoid some of the costs to local communities created by large dams. Stakeholders in this rapid hydropower expansion include multiple actors with often diverging sets of interests. The resulting governance challenges are centered on tradeoffs between local electricity and revenue from the sale of hydropower, on the one hand, and the impacts on small-scale irrigation systems, riparian-corridor ecosystem services, and other natural resource-based livelihoods, on the other. We focus on the Bhilangana river basin, where water dependent livelihoods differentiated by gender include farming, fishing, livestock rearing and fodder collection. We examine the contradictions inherent in hydropower governance based on the interests of local residents and other stakeholders including hydropower developers, urban and other regional electricity users, and state-level policymakers. We use a social justice approach applied to hydropower projects to examine some of the negative impacts, especially by location and gender, of these projects on local communities and then identify strategies that can safeguard or enhance livelihoods of women, youth, and men in areas with hydropower projects, while also maintaining critical ecosystem services. By assessing the Bhilangana basin case, we also offer hydropower-livelihoods-irrigation nexus lessons for headwater regions across the Himalayas and globally.

AB The conventions and ratifications made by the United Nations (UN) have a long history. They were well respected for their ability to unite the world's countries on some issues. The paradigm transformation of UN ratifications to combine both business models and social justice has received both positive and negative responses. While adherents argue that such a transformation is fundamental to boost economic development, opponents assert that the 'so-called paradigm transformation' has benefited the West by victimising the East, which has essentially complicated the global 'sustainability crisis'. This also hinders executing the ESD (education for sustainable development) concept, especially in developing countries. The concept of 'sustainable development' is now the main agenda item of UN conventions. COP21 (United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015, otherwise known as the 21st Conference of the Parties), is an example of the UN's seriousness in addressing the 'global sustainability crisis'. GATT and GATS are the international policies that are, respectively, the 'causer' and 'developer' of the private university sector in emerging market economies. Critics claim that this expanding sector generates an urban sustainability crisis. This study examined the effect of private universities' expansion on urban sustainability, using a qualitative method for assessing primary and secondary data. The indices for night light intensity, heat and greenery served as the essential parameters to calculate the sustainability crisis. Results indicate that while the greenery index has fallen significantly, night light and heat indices have unexpectedly increased, which correlate with the development and expansion of the private university sector. To respond to COP21, a 'carbon neutrality' policy framework for the sector is suggested in an effort to control the sustainability crisis.

AB The provision and administration of high quality urban public green spaces intertwines issues of planning, design, management and maintenance with governance. The benefits of such spaces are often tied to social justice, public health and recreation, biodiversity and-helping cities to deal with climate change. International policies and changes in public administration have encouraged user participation across multiple phases of green space development. Although sceptics towards participation are easily found supporting arguments sometimes stand without critique, not questioning how participation affects the physical quality of green spaces. This literature review surveyed empirical scientific studies seeking to answer the following research question: How does research to date reflect over user participation's contribution to public urban green space quality? The review includes 31 articles from peer-reviewed scientific journals and finds an array of arguments used to support and attribute potential benefits to participation. However, analysing what has been empirically tested in these articles shows an even and general lack of proof for these arguments, implying that many arguments for participation are taken for granted. A particularly large disparity was found between the discussing and testing of many arguments regarding how participation may directly benefit urban green spaces. Rather than assessing the physical outputs of participation, most of the empirical studies tested process benefits to users and administrators. Due to the discovered predominance of these process-driven studies, it remains unclear whether participation actually improves green spaces, or if it is just for the benefit of the people involved. The gap in scientific knowledge found here calls for a re-focus to case level research, empirically testing where the actual benefits of participation lie and how participation processes might best lead to high quality green spaces in practice.

AB Adaptive water governance systems are underpinned by enhanced social learning capacity of the society of actors to understand and adapt to changes properly. Thus, as a first step, it is crucial to assess the learning capacity of water actors in different levels, as human components of a socio-ecological system (SES), to know how to improve the water resources system adaptive capacity. Aiming at practicing assessment of learning capacity in a society of water actors, the present paper focuses on local water users, one the society of farmers using the groundwater resource in Rafsanjan Plain and the other one the society of farmers in Lakes Tashk-Bakhtegan Basin, both situated in the southern Iran. A methodological framework was developed and adopted to assess the learning capacity of water users corresponding to both the process of learning (represented by social justice, perception of interdependency, mutual trust, and interaction among all stakeholders) and the learning outcomes (including width, direction, depth and orientation of learning). The required data were collected using semi-structured interviews. The results showed how the responses of the local water users are affected by the mechanisms which are rooted in the social memory, technology, path dependency, and the degree of access to water. Although most of the researchers have addressed the social learning to have positive and constructive outcomes, the results of this research revealed the process of social learning resulted in neutral and destructive outcomes among water users in the study areas. Assessment of learning capacity in the water associated societies, using the methodological framework developed in this research, can help set off removing learning barriers and enhancing the socio-ecological system adaptive capacity.

AB Urban resilience frameworks and strategies currently taken up in cities around the globe fall short of adequately preparing urban communities for the scale of change that many will face in coming decades. For cities aiming to address the impacts of climate change in a proactive sense as well as post-disaster, urban resilience presents itself as a useful frame, grounded in both ecological systems theory and psychological theory. This chapter tackles the question of where the notion of resilience helps, and where it holds cities back, in terms of urban planning and policy. Resilience in the urban planning and policy context may hold cities back because it lacks normative value in social and political spheres. That is, while concepts such as social justice and sustainable development suggest a normative direction for planning toward the improvement of our communities, resilience thinking does not imply any value-based criteria by which communities might determine how best to "bounce back" or "bounce forward." Additional tools for urban resilience planning are needed, and we suggest and elaborate here upon two: the development path and regenerative sustainability. The notion of the development path originated within the IPCC process and draws upon futures studies, scenario planning and backcasting, in order to understand the social and political change and decision making implications of responding to climate change. The second concept we offer, regenerative sustainability, can be considered as the work of increasing the capacity of the current generation to give back more than we receive. The contribution of these two concepts to the value of urban resilience thinking in political contexts is explained through a discussion of five possible scenarios of urban transformation, which vary in terms of the social and political intentions at work in the strategies needed to build resilience.

AB Scarcity is a dangerous idea and has long been a totalising discourse in resource politics and mainstream economics. A large body of work has critiqued the naturalisation of scarcity in discourses of environmental change, and has highlighted problems in how scarcity is conceptualised and the ways in which scarcities are socially and politically generated. Despite this, the 'scarcity postulate' - an assumed mismatch between infinitely expanding human desires and finite means to realise them remains a powerful concept that continues to be deployed and re-deployed in a host of debates concerning environment and natural resources. From the 'Limits to Growth' debates that influenced environmental movements in the 1970s, discussions concerning the causes and consequences of the overlapping food, fuel and finance crises of the 2000s to debates concerning climate change, environmental security and militarisation in the Anthropocene, the discursive constellation of scarcity seems always at work. The focus of this special issue is the cross-scalar dynamics of what we identify as a 'new politics of scarcity'. This new politics is associated with new framings, contestations and entanglements of scarcity that are associated with new configurations of actors, new political economic relations and new spatialities and geographies of resource control and violence. Building on the empirical cases developed in this special issue, we examine the dynamics and the 'work' of the new cross-scalar scarcity politics in sustaining elite and capitalist power through justifying resource acquisitions and enclosures, large-scale policy reforms in the name of 'austerity' and intensification of extraction whilst politically side-stepping more thorny politics of (re)distribution, mis-appropriation, dispossession and social justice. We conclude by looking at alternative framings and vernacular conceptions of sustainability that challenge dominant scarcity-driven policies and programmes that intensify local exclusions and inequalities.

AB It is becoming clear that increasingly complex global challenges cannot simply be solved by new technology or governments alone. We also need to develop new social practices and encourage a broader cultural shift towards sustainability. Against this background, this paper explores the role of mindfulness in adapting to increasing risk and climate change. Based on a literature review, it assesses current research on 'mindful climate adaptation', and explores how individual mindfulness is linked to climate adaptation. While in practice mindfulness-based approaches to climate adaptation have gained widespread recognition (e.g., by the United Nations), the results show that related research is scarce and fragmented. There is almost no research into the role of mindfulness in climate adaptation. At the same time, new scientific domains are opening up in cognate fields that illuminate the mindfulness-adaptation nexus from certain perspectives. These fields include: (1) disaster management; (2) individual well-being; (3) organisational management; (4) environmental behaviour; (5) social justice; and (6) knowledge production. As new concepts and approaches emerge, they require critical construct validation and empirical testing. The importance of further investigation is supported by a complementary empirical study, which shows that individual mindfulness disposition coincides with increased motivation to take (or support) climate adaptation actions. The paper concludes that mindfulness has the potential to facilitate adaptation at all scales (through cognitive, managerial, structural, ontological, and epistemological change processes) and should, therefore, become a core element in climate and associated sustainability research. Finally, it sketches the conceptual trajectories of the mindfulness-adaptation nexus and presents a pioneering, comprehensive framework for 'mindful climate adaptation'.

AB Evidence shows the importance of food systems for sustainable development: they are at the nexus that links food security, nutrition, and human health, the viability of ecosystems, climate change, and social justice. However, agricultural policies tend to focus on food supply, and sometimes, on mechanisms to address negative externalities. We propose an alternative. Our starting point is that agriculture and food systems' policies should be aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This calls for deep changes in comparison with the paradigms that prevailed when steering the agricultural change in the XXth century. We identify the comprehensive food systems transformation that is needed. It has four parts: first, food systems should enable all people to benefit from nutritious and healthy food. Second, they should reflect sustainable agricultural production and food value chains. Third, they should mitigate climate change and build resilience. Fourth, they should encourage a renaissance of rural territories. The implementation of the transformation relies on (i) suitable metrics to aid decision-making, (ii) synergy of policies through convergence of local and global priorities, and (iii) enhancement of development approaches that focus on territories. We build on the work of the "Milano Group," an informal group of experts convened by the UN Secretary General in Milan in 2015. Backed by a literature review, what emerges is a strategic narrative linking climate, agriculture and food, and calling for a deep transformation of food systems at scale. This is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The narrative highlights the needed consistency between global actions for sustainable development and numerous local-level innovations. It emphasizes the challenge of designing differentiated paths for food systems transformation responding to local and national expectations. Scientific and operational challenges are associated with the alignment and arbitration of local action within the context of global priorities.

AB This paper posits that Pope Francis' 2015 encyclical on environmental climate change, Laudato si' ("Praise be to you, my Lord"), or LS for short, provides a compelling and multi-faceted framework for co-creating a just and sustainable environment. LS includes considerable commentary about how markets and marketing impact the physical and social environment. Additionally, the document provides religion-inspired ethical norms for market conditions, actions, and performance that reflect both (a) the social teachings of the Catholic Church as they have evolved over the past 125 years and, as we will explain, (b) a foundational predicate of macromarketing scholarship - that is, a recognition of market systems as the primary mechanism for effectively and efficiently provisioning goods and services in contemporary society. The intent of this paper is also to harmonize two perspectives of business purpose regarding ecological issues (i.e., ethical efficacy vs. economic efficiency), commonly seen as conflicting and mutually exclusive. Absent that harmonization, those perspectives appear to force a choice between "social values and norms" and "economic incentives and circumstances" - a dichotomy that is neither optimal nor practical. Rather, we recognize that key themes in Laudato si'(LS) - environmental stewardship, concern for social justice, and a "common good" orientation that supersedes economic advantage - also correspond to issues addressed by macromarketing scholars since that sub-discipline emerged. LS is foremost a powerful "Call to Action" for those who care about protecting the ecological environment. However, LS is intentionally vague about specific solutions. It defers to analysts, academics, and policy experts to provide those. This paper outlines how macromarketing researchers are powerfully positioned to suggest the specific market and policy adjustments called for in LS.

We identify the comprehensive food systems transformation that is needed. It has four parts: first, food systems should enable all people to benefit from nutritious and healthy food. Second, they should reflect sustainable agricultural production and food value chains. Third, they should mitigate climate change and build resilience. Fourth, they should encourage a renaissance of rural territories. The implementation of the transformation relies on (i) suitable metrics to aid decision-making, (ii) synergy of policies through convergence of local and global priorities, and (iii) enhancement of development approaches that focus on territories. We build on the work of the "Milano Group," an informal group of experts convened by the UN Secretary General in Milan in 2015. Backed by a literature review, what emerges is a strategic narrative linking climate, agriculture and food, and calling for a deep transformation of food systems at scale. This is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The narrative highlights the needed consistency between global actions for sustainable development and numerous local-level innovations. It emphasizes the challenge of designing differentiated paths for food systems transformation responding to local and national expectations. Scientific and operational challenges are associated with the alignment and arbitration of local action within the context of global priorities.

AB Historically there was a general trend towards infrastructural and physical investment in supply side water related initiatives for the provision of clean drinking water and livelihood needs such as irrigation and agriculture. The critical missing link was the absence of a social/human aspect to water resources and its relation to the human society. Access to water resources revolved predominantly around the health and livelihood needs of the society. Multiple values that a society could derive from its access to water were ignored. This limited focus on access to water coupled with a growing problem of water scarcity gave birth to a new phenomenon of considering water as an 'economic good'. This commoditization of water meant water was provided based on the ability to pay and efficiency of use, thus further alienated the social value of water. Furthermore, the link between water and society can also be viewed from a hazards perspective. With the increasing awareness of climate change and water related hazards, view of water based upon assumption of average normal conditions is no longer tenable. Building resilience and adaptation capacity to address water hazards must involve a fundamental shift towards a planning paradigm that works inwards from extremes rather than outward from means. With this background, the objective of the chapter is to review water research literature through the tri-focal lens of Access, Equity and Hazards and attempt to identify the gaps - when the water resources field is viewed through this tri-focallens. To set the stage, the chapter will first briefly discuss the rationale for the choice of our tri-focal analytical lens before delving into the international academic and policy literature to address the aforementioned objectives.

AB Evidence shows the importance of food systems for sustainable development: they are at the nexus that links food security, nutrition, and human health, the viability of ecosystems, climate change, and social justice. However, agricultural policies tend to focus on food supply, and sometimes, on mechanisms to address negative externalities. We propose an alternative. Our starting point is that agriculture and food systems' policies should be aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This calls for deep changes in comparison with the paradigms that prevailed when steering the agricultural change in the XXth century. We identify the comprehensive food systems transformation that is needed. It has four parts: first, food systems should enable all people to benefit from nutritious and healthy food. Second, they should reflect sustainable agricultural production and food value chains. Third, they should mitigate climate change and build resilience. Fourth, they should encourage a renaissance of rural territories. The implementation of the transformation relies on (i) suitable metrics to aid decision-making, (ii) synergy of policies through convergence of local and global priorities, and (iii) enhancement of development approaches that focus on territories. We build on the work of the "Milano Group," an informal group of experts convened by the UN Secretary General in Milan in 2015. Backed by a literature review, what emerges is a strategic narrative linking climate, agriculture and food, and calling for a deep transformation of food systems at scale. This is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The narrative highlights the needed consistency between global actions for sustainable development and numerous local-level innovations. It emphasizes the challenge of designing differentiated paths for food systems transformation responding to local and national expectations. Scientific and operational challenges are associated with the alignment and arbitration of local action within the context of global priorities.

AB Despite a significant growth in food production over the past half-century, one of the most important challenges facing society today is how to feed an expected population of some nine billion by the middle of the 20th century. To meet the expected demand for food without significant increases in prices, it has been estimated that we need to produce 70-100 per cent more food, in light of the growing impacts of climate change, concerns over energy security, regional dietary shifts and the Millennium Development target of halving world poverty and hunger by 2015. The goal for the agricultural sector is no longer simply to maximize productivity, but to optimize across a far more complex landscape of production, rural development, environmental, social justice and food consumption outcomes. However, there remain significant challenges to developing national and international policies that support the wide emergence of more sustainable forms of land use and efficient agricultural production. The lack of information flow between scientists, practitioners and policy makers is known to exacerbate the difficulties, despite increased emphasis upon evidence-based policy. In this paper, we seek to improve dialogue and understanding between agricultural research and policy by identifying the 100 most important questions for global agriculture. These have been compiled using a horizon-scanning approach with leading experts and representatives of major agricultural organizations worldwide. The aim is to use sound scientific evidence to inform decision making and guide policy makers in the future direction of agricultural research priorities and policy support. If addressed, we anticipate that these questions will have a significant impact on global agricultural practices worldwide, while improving the synergy between agricultural policy, practice and research. This research forms part of the UK Government's Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures project.

TI Achieving zero deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon: What is missing?
SO ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
LA English

ID SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; CONSERVATION; DROUGHT; FUTURE; BEEF
AB Amazon deforestation causes severe climatic and ecological disruptions, with negative consequences for the livelihood of forest-dependent peoples. To avoid further disruptions, Brazil will need to take bold steps to eliminate both illegal and legal Amazon deforestation over the short term. Amazon deforestation declined by 70% between 2005 and 2014 due to drops in commodity prices and interventions by federal and state governments, such as law enforcement campaigns and credit restrictions for landowners who deforest illegally. Despite these impressive achievements, Brazil still deforests 5,000 km(2) of Amazonian forests each year. How then will Brazil eliminate Amazon deforestation altogether if the country is only committed to cut illegal deforestation by 2030-as stated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (iNDC) to the 2015 climate change treaty meeting in Paris? Here we provide an analysis of the major socio-economic-political threats that could constrain Brazil from achieving its current goals. We then propose six fundamental strategies to help Brazil achieve a more ambitious goal to eliminate all major legal and illegal Amazon deforestation. These strategies involve bringing social and environmental safeguards to the infrastructure plans in the region, consolidating and expanding positive incentives for the production of sustainable commodities, establishing a new policy to guarantee the social and environmental sustainability of rural settlements, fully implementing the national legislation protecting forests (the Forest Code), protecting the land rights of indigenous people and traditional communities, and expanding the existing network of protected areas, allocating the 80 million hectares of not designated public forests as protected areas or areas for sustainable use of timber and non-timber forest products. The implementation of these strategies however depends on the formulation of a new development paradigm that promotes economic growth, social justice and productive agriculture, while protecting the fundamentally important ecological services of tropical forests.

AB This study assesses the engagement of academic programs in sport management with global problems by using the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals as a proxy measure of these problems, and gauges the degree to which sport management programs are positioning themselves as providers of knowledge and expertise in the area of sustainable development. To this end, the authors examined the program descriptions, learning outcomes and curricula of 84 graduate programs in sport management or closely related fields at 65 R1 universities in the United States. Using inductive thematic analysis, they identified seven themes that are shared across multiple program curricula. The seven themes were labeled: sport sociology and sport ethics; globalization and economic growth; sport for development and peace; health; climate, environment and sustainability; gender; and inequality, discrimination and social justice. The overall results indicate that the discipline has coalesced around a key set of skills and content areas. This standardization may come at the expense of adaptability and responsiveness to changes in sport and in society. Academic programs are generally unwilling to depart from a twentieth-century model of education built around a supposition that the sport manager's primary responsibilities are revenue generation and liability mitigation. As the unsustainability of late capitalism becomes increasingly difficult to ignore, students and educators will find it correspondingly complicated to reconcile the contradiction between sport-as-business-enterprise and the notion that sport itself can contribute to social or moral development. This long-standing compromising attitude and failure to acknowledge the need for wholesale change will only require much more disruptive and perhaps radical reform in the future. Faced with pressure from various stakeholders, many sport organizations employ sustainability units or departments. Although imperfect, these efforts often exceed those made by academic programs.

   migration; Kalapara; environment; sea level; social justice; development
AB Sea level rise, tropical cyclones, saltwater intrusion, and coastal flooding along with many other natural hazards are increasingly common in many parts of the world, and regions like coastal Bangladesh are at the frontline of these impacts. Due, in part, to the ongoing climate crisis, male members of coastal households in Bangladesh are outmigrating temporarily or permanently. Reduced farm productivity can be blamed on this to a large extent. Men leave female members of their households behind in their coastal villages during the first phase of migration. This creates a new form of social injustice as women are not only exposed to the negative impacts of the climate crisis to a larger extent, but they also face the challenges of maintaining a farming livelihood as they confront patriarchal socio-cultural norms and expectations during the absence of male members of the families. Using the frameworks of critical development and political ecology, this paper unpacks how these farming women who stay in the rural villages in coastal Bangladesh have a higher social vulnerability then men do. More particularly, this paper illustrates the complex nature of social and environmental injustice, experienced by women because of the outmigration of male members of the households. An intersectional approach further explains how, in contrast to usual class / income privileges, religio-cultural norms and prohibitions result in women belonging to the ethno-religious majority being more vulnerable than minority women. This is due to restrictions from interacting alone with men to whom they are not related, which reduces their access to the knowledge and resources that flows though male-dominated social networks. This article contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and the environment, mediated by various social, cultural, and political factors, and provides critical policy insights on inclusive adaptation and long-term sustainability.

AB The challenges of development were addressed in the second half of the 20th century by searching for a comprehensive, endogenous and sustainable model. However, attempts to transfer the resulting proposals into an environmentally sensitive reality with a human face have not borne the fruit expected of them. The scenes one sees in today's globalised world only highlight the vast differences between north and south, which speak of the failure of policies to wipe out hunger and build a lasting peace. The countries and groups which control economy have imposed upon us all an asymmetrical, tremendously unfair type of globalisation that has thrust the world deep into crisis. While it is dangerous for a system based on equality to forget freedom, it is no less dangerous for a system based on freedom to forget equality and justice.
   Development is a human right and an ethical imperative. However, population should participate in the social processes involved as well as in the handling of environmental problems. Our models' lack of sustainability leaps to the eye once we realize that, together with the inconvenient truth about climate change presented by Al Gore, we also have among us another and even more inconvenient truth, that of the way people live, the truth that a large part of the world's population has to strive to survive under truly adverse conditions.
   It was a mistake to have swapped democratic values like social justice, equality and solidarity for the laws of the market, Mending that mistake will require a course change and an urgent decision to fly to the rescue. The time has come for citizen participation, which could change the crisis into a great opportunity. Education undoubtedly plays an important part in this process by contributing to the essential transition of people from their implicit or explicit role as subjects to that of participative citizens.

   justice; Health disparities; Climate change
AB BackgroundInclusion of environmental health (EH) in medical education serves as a catalyst for preparing future physicians to address issues as complex as climate change and health, water pollution and lead contamination. However, previous research has found EH education to be largely lacking in U.S. medical education, putting future physicians at risk of not having the expertise to address patients' environmental illnesses, nor speak to prevention.MethodsEnvironmental health (EH) knowledge and skills were incorporated into the first-year medical school curriculum at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine (Nutley, New Jersey), via a two-hour interactive large group learning module with follow up activities. Students completed the Environmental Health in Med School (EHMS) survey before and after the year 1 EH module. This survey evaluates medical students' attitudes, awareness and professionalism regarding environmental health. In year 2, students completed the Environmental Health Survey II, which measured students' perceptions of preparedness to discuss EH with future patients. The research team created both surveys based upon learning objectives that broadly aligned with the Institute of Medicine six competency-based environmental health learning objectives.Results36year 1 students completed both the pre and post EHMS surveys. McNemar's test was used for paired comparisons. Results identified no statistically significant changes from pre to post surveys, identifying a dramatic ceiling.When comparing year 2, EHS II pre-survey (n=84) and post-survey (n=79) responses, a statistically significant positive change in students' self-reported sense of preparedness to discuss environmental health with their patients following the curriculum intervention was noted.ConclusionsOur conclusion for the EHMS in Year 1 was that the current generation of medical students at this school is already extremely aware of and concerned about the impact of environmental issues on health.Through the EHS II in Year 2, we found that the six-week environmental health module combining didactic and experiential elements significantly increased medical students' self-reported sense of preparedness to discuss environmental health issues, including climate change, with their patients.

AB Urban parks provide multiple ecosystem services to mitigate challenges from climate change and urbanisation. They promote health and well-being by providing space for physical activity and social interaction, which is particularly relevant for vulnerable groups such as children and older people. As a key element, park vegetation creates favourable environments, as it moderates heat, buffers noise and can be enjoyed by citizens. In this paper, we present the results of a multi-method empirical study conducted in the city of Leipzig, Germany, during the summer heat and drought period in July 2018. Visitation patterns were analysed through qualitative observation and structured counting in two differently characterised urban parks - a newly developed urban park on a former railway brownfield and a long-standing, older park with a mature tree population. The results indicate that park design elements are linked to park use activities and park user age groups such as young children, school children and older people. Young children were identified as mostly using playgrounds and natural lawn areas in the old park, while school children and teenagers tended to use the sports areas and semisecluded spaces in the newly developed park to play sports or to meet in groups and socialize. For older people, sedentary activity was exclusively observed on benches, and non-sedentary activity such as jogging was nearly exclusively identified in the larger, more shaded older park. The number of counted park users, particularly numbers of children and older people, significantly declined at the highest temperature of approximately 30 degrees C. Considering the provision and availability of inclusive design elements that support these use behaviours may increase the motivation of all age groups to use green spaces and to benefit from the services they provide. Planning for a more effective and just provision of ecosystem services requires the consideration of age-specific design elements to invite use from all population groups equally and to contribute to distributional justice.

AB This paper introduces a scalable "climate health justice" model for assessing and projecting incidence, treatment costs, and sociospatial disparities for diseases with well-documented climate change linkages. The model is designed to employ low-cost secondary data, and it is rooted in a perspective that merges normative environmental justice concerns with theoretical grounding in health inequalities. Since the model employs International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) disease codes, it is transferable to other contexts, appropriate for use across spatial scales, and suitable for comparative analyses. We demonstrate the utility of the model through analysis of 2008-2010 hospitalization discharge data at state and county levels in Texas (USA). We identified several disease categories (i.e., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, heat-related, and respiratory) associated with climate change, and then selected corresponding ICD-9 codes with the highest hospitalization counts for further analyses. Selected diseases include ischemic heart disease, diarrhea, heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke/syncope, and asthma. Cardiovascular disease ranked first among the general categories of diseases for age-adjusted hospital admission rate (5286.37 per 100,000). In terms of specific selected diseases (per 100,000 population), asthma ranked first (517.51), followed by ischemic heart disease (195.20), diarrhea (75.35), and heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke/syncope (7.81). Charges associated with the selected diseases over the 3-year period amounted to US$5.6 billion. Blacks were disproportionately burdened by the selected diseases in comparison to non-Hispanic whites, while Hispanics were not. Spatial distributions of the selected disease rates revealed geographic zones of disproportionate risk. Based upon a down-scaled regional climate-change projection model, we estimate a >5% increase in the incidence and treatment costs of asthma attributable to climate change between the baseline and 2040-2050 in Texas. Additionally, the inequalities described here will be accentuated, with blacks facing amplified health disparities in the future. These predicted trends raise both intergenerational and distributional climate health justice concerns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change-related hazards and disasters, known to adversely impact physical and mental health outcomes, are also expected to result in human migration above current levels. Environmentally-motivated migration and displacement may lead to the disruption of existing social ties, with potentially adverse consequences for mobile populations as well as their family members who remain in places of origin. We propose that the disruption of social ties is a key mechanism by which climate-related migration may negatively impact mental health, in particular. Existing social ties may provide social and material resources that buffer mental health stressors related to both prolonged and acute climate events. Preparation for such events may also strengthen these same ties and protect mental health. Communities may leverage social ties, first to mitigate climate change, and second, to adapt and rebuild post-disaster in communities of origin. Additionally, social ties can inform migration decisions and destinations. For example, scholars have found that the drought-motivated adaptive migration of West African Fulbe herders only occurred because of the long-term development of social networks between migrants and non-migrants through trade and seasonal grazing. On the other hand, social ties do not always benefit mental health. Some migrants, including those from poor regions or communities with no formal safety net, may face considerable burden to provide financial and emotional resources to family members who remain in countries of origin. In destination communities, migrants often face significant social marginalization. Therefore, policies and programs that aim to maintain ongoing social ties among migrants and their family and community members may be critically important in efforts to enhance population resilience and adaptation to climate change and to improve mental health outcomes. Several online platforms, like Refugee Start Force, serve to integrate refugees by connecting migrants directly to people and services in destination communities. These efforts may increasingly draw upon novel technologies to support and maintain social networks in the context of population mobility due to climatic and other factors.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

DE Consumption; GHG calculations; Cities; Eco-governmentality; Sweden
ID GOVERNMENTALITY; CARBON
AB Sweden has been praised for its sustainability efforts and decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. When nations and urban districts publicize their low GHG emissions, these emissions are often based on a production perspective including only emissions occurring within their geographical boundary. If instead a consumption perspective is applied then all emissions attributable to the inhabitants consumption patterns, no matter where they occur, are included, e.g. from imported goods and air travel. This provides new outlooks on sustainability, from this perspective Swedish emissions have increased rather than decreased in the last decades. Swedish researchers and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency propose that the production perspective should be complemented with a consumption perspective to describe more fairly who is responsible for what emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a consumption perspective on GHG emissions has gained ground in Sweden, specifically in the new Strategic Climate Program of the City of Gothenburg, discussing what municipal strategies and environmental discourses this perspective enhances. Applying actor network theory, we found three common features of importance for Sweden, and the City of Gothenburg, supporting the consumption perspective to gain ground. One is the existence of long-term environmental goals that facilitate this perspective. The other features are the existence of civil servants as drivers and the use of calculations from legitimate "fact builders." We conclude that a consumption perspective strengthens the environmental justice discourse (as it claims to be a more just way of calculating global and local environmental effects) while possibly also increasing an individualized environmental discourse (as many municipal strategies aim to inform and influence the public to make lifestyle changes on their own). We argue that a consumption perspective is necessary in order to fully address environmental problems and to highlight issues of justice and responsibility. At the same time, this kind of eco-governmentality might lead to individualized self-governed climate subjects with outlooks that are too limited to foster change of dominant everyday practices.

AB Urban development can have negative impacts on the environment through various mechanisms. While many air quality studies have been carried out in more developed nations, Eastern Caribbean (EC) countries remain understudied. This study aims to estimate the concentrations of air pollutants in the EC nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Transport, recreation and construction sites were selected randomly using local land use records. Pollutant levels were measured repeatedly for numerous 1-hour intervals in each location between October 2015 and November 2018. Weather trends and land use characteristics were collected concurrent to sampling. Across 27 sites, mean NO2, O-3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 26.61 ppb (range: 0-306 ppb), 11.94 ppb (0-230 ppb), 27.9 ppb (0-700 ppb), 52.9 mu g m(-3) (0-10,400 mu g m(-3)) and 29.8 mu g m(-3) (0-1556 mu g m(-3)), respectively. Pollutants were elevated in high urban areas and generally significantly positively correlated with each other, with the exception of PM10. NO2 levels in construction areas were generally comparable to those in transportation areas and higher than in recreation areas. O-3 levels were lower in construction than recreation and transport areas. SO2 concentrations were lower in construction and recreation compared to transport sites. Construction and recreation PM10 levels exceeded transport sites, while PM2.5 was highest in construction areas. Additional bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to assess whether various meteorological, temporal and land use factors including rain, tour season and urban features explained variability in air pollutant concentrations. Tourist season and specific months, more than any other factors, contributed most to variability in pollutant concentrations. These new measurements of air pollution concentrations in an understudied nation may have important implications for health outcomes among exposed EC residents, and provide critical data for future exposure and epidemiologic research and environmental policy.

TI FROM THE GREENHOUSE TO THE POORHOUSE: CARBON-EMISSIONS CONTROL AND THE
   RULES OF LEGISLATIVE JOINDER
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; FEDERAL-RULES; CRITIQUE; PARTIES; MARKET; FAIR
AB Climate change is no ordinary policy problem. Its regulation certainly is no ordinary policy initiative. No one should be surprised, therefore, that reaching principled choices about its substantive scope requires more than routine policy analysis. A purely political calculus will likely result in legislation that ignores urgent human needs while providing environmentally counterproductive subsidies to current polluters.
   Pending legislation to address carbon-emissions includes large subsidies for existing emitters. These subsidies make little sense economically or politically. Worse, they divert resources needed to address two crucial issues that the proposed legislation largely ignores: the impact of raising carbon costs on low-income people and the effects of the pending legislation on the massive structural federal deficit.
   A carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would substantially increase costs not only for transportation but also for food and housing. With poverty levels rising even before the current economic downturn, the consequences of these price increases could be dire. Even without the pending legislation, the structural deficit will require deflationary tax increases or spending cuts. Combining carbon regulation with these measures could do severe damage.
   Although few challenge their merits, these proposals may nonetheless fail if a consensus emerges that they are extraneous to climate change legislation. Overly complex legislation often bogs down, and we lack coherent normative principles for "issue joinder" in public policy debates. Such principles can be derived and can counsel how we address both low-income subsidies and deficit reduction as part of climate change legislation.
   Another challenge is finding efficient means to deliver subsidies without disrupting incentives to conserve. Energy companies are likely to divert proposed allocations for this purpose to writing off bad debt. Funding energy-assistance programs will similarly crowd out existing resources. Prior piecemeal efforts to address high energy costs provide invaluable lessons on designing a system that offsets rising carbon costs without distorting consumers' incentives. The large majority of proceeds not needed for low-income subsidies should be reserved for deficit reduction.

AB People from across the Caylloma Province of Peru are adapting to social-ecological changes, such as decreasing water supplies and rapidly retreating glaciers, in different and unequal ways. In this study, we show how this inequality is intersectional; identities like gender and age compound and interact with systems of power to shape how people adapt to these changes at the individual, household, and district scales. We draw from 130 semi-structured interviews with agricultural actors and participant observations in district and regional meetings across four districts, to demonstrate how intersectionality shapes adaptation to social-ecological change. Our results show (1) what social-ecological changes are perceived and experienced, (2) how individuals, households, and groups within the agricultural sector adapt to these changes in private (at the individual and household scale) and public adaptation spaces (institutions where people adapt collectively within each district), and (3) how intersectionality shapes adaptive capacity to these changes. Specifically, we found that 'unskilled' women diversified their income through day-labor in agriculture, while 'unskilled' men had more options for income diversification. Migrants who are also renters had access to water; however, migrants who lived in informal settlements lacked water access. Pastoralists over 50 faced more difficulties pursuing income diversification and labor migration than younger populations with similar livelihoods. Public adaptation spaces, including irrigation commissions, were largely designed for Spanish-speaking men who own land, which caused additional barriers for Quechua speakers, women, and migrants who used this space to contribute to adaptation for themselves, their household, and for the broader district. Together, these results expand scholarship on differential adaptation to social-ecological change within globally marginalized, yet locally heterogenous, communities. In particular, this study brings to light how intersecting identities, along with the social, political and economic structures in which they are situated, can lead to unequal adaptation opportunities within heterogeneous communities.

AB In the face of climate change, achieving resilience of desirable aspects of food-energy-water (FEW) systems already strained by competing multi-scalar social objectives requires interdisciplinary approaches. This study is part of a larger effort exploring "Innovations in the Food-Energy-Water Nexus (INFEWS)" in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) through coordinated modeling and simulated management scenarios. Here, we focus on a case study and conceptual mapping of the Yakima River Basin (YRB), a sub-basin of the CRB. Previous research on FEW system management and resilience includes some attention to social dynamics (e.g., economic and governance systems); however, more attention to social drivers and outcomes is needed. Our goals are to identify several underutilized ways to incorporate social science perspectives into FEW nexus research and to explore how this interdisciplinary endeavor alters how we assess innovations and resilience in FEW systems. First, we investigate insights on FEW nexus resilience from the social sciences. Next, we delineate strategies for further incorporation of social considerations into FEW nexus research, including the use of social science perspectives and frameworks such as socio-ecological resilience and community capitals. Then, we examine a case study of the YRB, focusing on the historical development of the FEW nexus and innovations. We find that a resilience focus applied to the FEW nexus can inadvertently emphasize a status quo imposed by those already in power. Incorporating perspectives from the social sciences, which highlight issues related to inequality, power, and social justice, can address these shortcomings and inform future innovations. Finally, we use causal loop diagrams to explore the role of the social in the FEW nexus, and we suggest ways to incorporate social aspects into an existing stock and flow object-oriented modeling system. This project represents a starting point for a continued research agenda that incorporates social dynamics into FEW system resilience modeling and management in the CRB.

AB An effective response to climate change demands rapid replacement of fossil carbon energy sources. This must occur concurrently with an ongoing rise in total global energy consumption. While many modelled scenarios have been published claiming to show that a 100% renewable electricity system is achievable, there is no empirical or historical evidence that demonstrates that such systems are in fact feasible. Of the studies published to date, 24 have forecast regional, national or global energy requirements at sufficient detail to be considered potentially credible. We critically review these studies using four novel feasibility criteria for reliable electricity systems needed to meet electricity demand this century. These criteria are: (1) consistency with mainstream energy-demand forecasts; (2) simulating supply to meet demand reliably at hourly, half-hourly, and five-minute timescales, with resilience to extreme climate events; (3) identifying necessary transmission and distribution requirements; and (4) maintaining the provision of essential ancillary services. Evaluated against these objective criteria, none of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. Eight of 24 scenarios (33%) provided no form of system simulation. Twelve (50%) relied on unrealistic forecasts of energy demand. While four studies (17%; all regional) articulated transmission requirements, only two scenarios drawn from the same study addressed ancillary-service requirements. In addition to feasibility issues, the heavy reliance on exploitation of hydroelectricity and biomass raises concerns regarding environmental sustainability and social justice. Strong empirical evidence of feasibility must be demonstrated for any study that attempts to construct or model a low-carbon energy future based on any combination of low-carbon technology. On the basis of this review, efforts to date seem to have substantially underestimated the challenge and delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways.

AB Ensuring adequate food availability to an increasing world population constitutes one of the biggest challenges faced by humankind. Scientific and technological advances in food production during the last century enabled agriculture to cope with the concomitant increase in food demand. For example, cereal yields have more than doubled from a global average of 1.5 metric tons per hectare in the 1960s up to 3.2 metric tons per hectare in 2018. This was made possible by the work in different research fields such as agronomy, engineering, and plant sciences, showing that an inter and multidisciplinary approach is indispensable for significant progress. This manuscript is aimed at generating reflexion and analysis about the challenges that agriculture faces at present to satisfy projected food demands, which implies a further doubling of food production by 2050, according to the latest estimates. Relevant issues related to food production (climate change, pollution of water and soils by pesticides and fertilizers, loss of germplasm and biodiversity) are discussed and potential solutions to achieve food security in quantity and quality are reviewed, mainly from the plant breeding and crop-production perspectives, always associated with environmental health preservation and improvement. A broad transdisciplinary effort is needed to increase the impact of science and technology to provide more people with healthier and safer food, produced in a sustainable way. Nonetheless, science and technology alone will not succeed to meet those challenges. Education and knowledge transfer strategies are needed to guarantee responsible production and consumption everywhere, therefore allowing the benefits of scientific and technological progress reach the world population. Simultaneously, adequate action by regulatory authorities and governments concerted at international level, with thorough application of the Precautionary Principle, and aiming at environmental and social justice are imperatively required to meet the challenge and achieve the goal.

AB Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomorphology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical innovations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the landscape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing development of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomorphological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of climate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science - a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity.

AB The goal of this paper is to analyze how and with what results place-based climate service coproduction may be enacted within a community for whom climate change is not a locally salient concern. Aiming to initiate a climate-centered dialogue, a hybrid team of scientists and artists collected local narratives within the Kerourien neighbourhood, in the city of Brest in Brittany, France. Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture.
   The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhood's 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment - thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that "place-based climate service co-production for action" may require questioning the nature of the "services" rendered, questioning the nature of "place," and questioning what "action" entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice.

   PATHWAYS; LIMITS; PERSPECTIVE; POLITICS; RIGHTS
AB As observed and predicted losses and damages from climate change impacts grow increasingly severe, calls for transformation as a response to long-term climate change have become more frequent. Transformational approaches have also been integrated into the global climate change regime under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of the workplan of the Executive Committee guiding the implementation of the Warsaw international mechanism, the oversight body on loss and damage. However, there has as yet been no attempt to define what is meant by transformation in the context of loss and damage. This paper attempts to clarify the burgeoning academic and policy literature by positing three types of transformation as a response to loss and damage: transformation as adaptation (an intensification of dominant socio-ecological relationships), transformation as extension (when the limits of established adaptive capacity are reached) and transformation as liberation (adopting development pathways that address the root causes of vulnerability). Transformation as liberation is proposed as a deeper change to social-technological systems to avoid and minimize loss and damage in ways that enhance social justice and sustainability. To provide the kind of information decision makers need to plan and implement transformation as liberation, more research is needed on how to plan in a way that ensures the most equitable outcomes. Key policy insights Loss and Damage is an opportunity to scrutinize and address the root causes of vulnerability. Framing climate change as a development crisis will allow opportunities for transformation as liberation to emerge. Transformation as liberation to address the root causes of vulnerability requires meaningful engagement with processes at all levels. A new model of global governance is needed in which global equity is a moral imperative. The transition to transformation as liberation must be just, which requires leadership, inclusive and participatory decision making and building alliances. The global Loss and Damage agenda could open up space for a broader discussion on how transformation as liberation can be facilitated to address inequalities both between and within countries.

AB Extensive research underscores that we interpret the world through metaphors; moreover, common metaphors are a useful means to enhance the pursuit of personal and collective goals. In the context of planetary health-defined as the interdependent vitality of all natural and anthropogenic ecosystems (social, political and otherwise)-one enduring metaphor can be found in the concept of "Spaceship Earth". Although not without criticism, the term "Spaceship Earth" has been useful to highlight both resource limitations and the beauty and fragility of delicate ecosystems that sustain life. Rene Dubos, who helped popularize the term, underscored the need for an exposome perspective, one that examines the total accumulated environmental exposures (both detrimental and beneficial) that predict the biological responses of the "total organism to the total environment" over time. In other words, how large-scale environmental changes affect us all personally, albeit in individualized ways. This commentary focuses the ways in which microbes, as an essential part of all ecosystems, provide a vital link between personal and planetary systems, and mediate the biopsychosocial aspects of our individualized experience-and thus health-over our life course journey. A more fine-grained understanding of these dynamics and our power to change them, personally and collectively, lies at the core of restoring "ecosystems balance" for person, place and planet. In particular, restoring human connectedness to the natural world, sense of community and shared purpose must occur in tandem with technological solutions, and will enhance individual empowerment for personal well-being, as well as our collective potential to overcome our grand challenges. Such knowledge can help shape the use of metaphor and re-imagine solutions and novel ways for restoration or rewilding of ecosystems, and the values, behaviors and attitudes to light the path toward exiting the Anthropocene.

TI Education quality, and teaching and learning in the post-2015 education
   agenda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Teaching; Learning; Education quality; UNESCO; Development; Post-2015
AB At present, there is an intense and wide-ranging debate on the future of global development. This debate occurs in a context of increasing global inequality, global economic recession, conflict, and climate change. Discussions about the post-2015 education and development agenda in this context ambitiously seek to eradicate poverty, promote social and economic inclusion, tackle climate change, promote equity, and access to quality education. While the exact goals are not yet agreed and the shape of the final post-2015 development is still to be settled, there is a widespread consensus that education is priority and that equitable and quality education is core to the agenda. In this context, this paper discusses the continuities and discontinuities in the proposed post-2015 quality agenda through a textual analysis of UNESCO consultations on Education for All (EFA). In particular, this article focuses on the UNESCO post-2015 position paper and the Muscat Global Education meeting agreement in April 2015. They are significant policy texts as they evidence the current global education discourse on education and the development agenda and reflect the broad consultations and thinking reflected in the thematic consultations. They also are important as they seek to clarify and secure the focus on the Education for All goals within a future post-2015 development agenda. The analysis of these texts pays particular attention to how quality is conceptualised in these texts, how it is translated into targets and how teachers are located in the global education quality discourse. The paper argues that while potentially broad conceptualisations of quality emerge from these texts, quality is still being defined as literacy and numeracy and still being constrained by what can be measured. While teachers are identified as crucial to the quality agenda, there is still a failure to engage more broadly with teaching and learning as well as the diverse contexts of teaching and learning. The article argues that what is needed is a continued foregrounding of quality as a dynamic, process oriented social justice endeavour to give effect to a holistic and comprehensive approach to the broad quality agenda.

AB Green spaces (GS) have many functions that can moderate the climate change impact and help prevent disease and thus alleviate public health expenses in a context of aging societies. However, several socioeconomic, demographic and geographic processes may render the access to GS challenging. Moreover, it is often critical to know what type of GS service to develop at a specific place. Also, measurements accuracy issues could be critical for planning and decision making. As an example of what could happen in many other cities of different sizes, we modeled and compared the access to GS, including several of their specific functions, in the Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) of Montreal and Quebec City in Canada. We used the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) (average of 3 million people per year over 1996-2011) to measure over time, the proximity of each individual to the closest GS boundary using travel costs and spatial interaction models. ANOVA models and their corresponding base regressions were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the relationship of GS distances and surface to density, deprivation, gender and age, including interaction terms. The spatial clustering of the reduction of distances to GS was evaluated on a chronological basis. Unlike the larger CMA of Montreal, Quebec City CMA showed greater equity in access to GS, largely due to the specific geographic insertion of linear GS. The CMA of Montreal showed an improvement in the access to GS which benefits the wealthy in the densest areas on the island of Montreal. Everything happens as if a green gentrification process affects the access to GS in Montreal. Our results suggest that for the promotion of GS as an important element of primary prevention in public health, both the quality or functions of GS and the geographic determinants of their access are of higher importance than a simple consideration of total GS surface per capita as often used by decision makers or public health promoters. They also underline the limits of standard measurements of attraction and accessibility and the complexity for large cities to promote environmental justice, given the complexity of their socio-demographic processes.

AB In 2015, the United Nation (UN) launched 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as part of an Agenda to be achieved by 2030. The target is having a global plan of action, aiming at universal peace and social and environmental justice. For this, 169 goals were drawn. The objective of this research is to discuss the congruence between mining activity and the SDG, starting from experiences of the scientific literature and the observation of one mining activity. For this purpose, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were used, with the keywords "sustainable development goals" and "mining". The Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) Portal was used to search papers that relate each one of the SDG to mining. Visits were made to three crushed stone mining industries, located in Monsenhor Gil, Piaui, Brazil, in order to follow the production process of the diabase mineral. From the research in the literature, it was possible to verify that there are several possibilities of reaching the 17 SDG in the mining sector, such as in the promotion of jobs (SDG 8), contributing to the reduction of poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2), among others. From the visits, it was observed that the compliance with SDG related to the promotion of jobs, the improvement of income for community's residents, and the infrastructure of the environment are common to all mining or business activities that reach remote and poor areas. This is clear when identifying mining regions that have lost their economic importance once the local development ceases. If the visited industries left the place, it would cause great loss to the residents that depend on them for their jobs. There is a small number of women on the staff, setting up disrespect for SDG 5 regarding the achievement of gender equality. The nature of the activity itself does not justify the asymmetry that possibly happened under the influence of a sexist culture that imposes what is a man's job or a woman's job. Another point is the lack of investment in inclusive education for employees and for residents of the region. In addition, these industries do not recover the degraded areas, compromising the achievement of SDG 13, in regard to combat climate change and its impacts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID EMOTIONAL DOG; CONSERVATIVES; CULTURE
AB Can't we all disagree more constructively? Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in political partisanship: the 2013 shutdown of the US government as well as an ever more divided political landscape in Europe illustrate that citizens and representatives of developed nations fundamentally disagree over virtually every significant issue of public policy, from immigration to health care, from the regulation of financial markets to climate change, from drug policies to medical procedures (Koleva et al. Journal of Research in Personality 46:184-194, 2012). The emerging field of political psychology brings the tools of moral psychology to bear on this issue. It suggests that the main conflict shaping politics today can be explained in terms of people's moral foundations (Graham et al. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 96(5):1029-1046, 2009; Haidt 2012; Graham et al. PLOS One 7(12):1-13, (2012); cf. also Rai and Fiske Psychological Review 118:57-75, 2011): progressive liberals, it is argued, view society as consisting of separate individuals with differing values and life plans, whereas conservatives rely on a thicker notion of political morality that includes traditions, communities, and values of purity (Haidt and Graham Social Justice Research 20:98-116, 2007). In this paper, I explore the normative implications of this theory. In particular, I will argue that its proponents take it to support an asymmetry of understanding: if deep political disagreements reflect differences in people's moral foundations, and these disagreements cannot be rationally resolved, then overcoming them makes it necessary to acknowledge the moral foundations of the other side's political outlook. But conservatives, the theory suggests, already do acknowledge all of the liberal moral foundations, and not vice versa. To overcome partisanship and the resulting political deadlock, then, it seems to be up to liberals to move closer towards the conservative side, and not vice versa. I wish to analyze what the argument for this asymmetry is and whether it holds up. In the end, I shall argue that the available evidence does support an asymmetry, but that it is the opposite of what Moral Foundations theorists think it is. There is such an asymmetry - but its burden falls on the conservative side.

TI Local stakeholders' assessment of community-based forest management and

AB The Philippines is one of the pioneers to adopt participatory approach in forest management, as embodied in. its national strategy for sustainable forest management and social justice in the uplands, called Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM). The program's almost three decades of implementation saw positive impacts on the livelihood assets of local communities. CBFM has evolved to tackle global concerns as well, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, international climate change negotiations have drawn a means to provide financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD Plus). This mechanism hopes to bring "triple benefits", namely: emission reduction, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. Given their parallel goals, CBFM sites are promising candidates for implementing REDD Plus, and the latter is expected to have important implications on the process and potential outcomes of CBFM. This paper looks into the local stakeholders' assessment of the impacts of CBFM on the livelihood assets of local communities and the potentials of REDD Plus implementation in the future. The literature is replete with examples emphasizing the importance of local stakeholder's participation in REDD Plus, yet their perception particularly on the added value it gives remained unclear. Results of the study revealed that CBFM implementation contributed largely to building the capital assets of people organization (PO) members, especially the human, social, natural and physical capitals. Full positive effects have yet to be realized though for the financial capital. PO members and the local institutions (DENR, LGU, NGO) expressed optimism, though with varied levels, on REDD Plus further enhancing the above capital assets. This optimism, however, does not translate to confidence in achieving the triple-benefits, as risks are also perceived by PO members posed by the likely creation of forest enclosures that could limit areas for livelihood activities. If realized, improved economic conditions could also encourage in-migration that would increase pressure to the forests. Caution should therefore be exercised in implementing REDD Plus to ensure that the intended goals are achieved in the context of views and aspirations of local stakeholders.

TI Climate capacity: the measurement for adaptation to climate change
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; climate capacity; adaptation; development; climate
   change economics
AB This article proposed the concept of "climate capacity" as a way of measuring human's adaptiveness to climate change. This article also focused on the related concepts like ecological carrying capacity, water resources carrying capacity, land carrying capacity as well as population carrying capacity. The concept of climate capacity was articulated against a background of global climate and environmental change. Essentially, China's efforts to adapt to climate change was a matter of improving climate capacity, which is the ecosystem as well as the frequency, the intensity and the scale of human's social activities that the climatic resources of a particular geographic area were supposed to support. The climate capacity has two components. One is the natural climate capacity, which includes temperature, sunlight, precipitation, extreme climatic events, etc. The other is the derived climate capacity, which includes water resources, land resources, ecological systems, climatic risks, etc. The climate capacity can be developed or be transferred between regions by taking engineering, technology or regime-based adaptive measures. However, these adaptive measures must be implemented under the principle of economic rationalism, ecological integrity, climate protection, and social justice. It is expected that by combining the climate capacity and its threshold value with the assessment of climate change risks, we are able to predict the optimal population carrying capacity and the scale of socioeconomic development, and furthermore, provide policy support for the socioeconomic development strategy and adaptive planning. In the regions with high climate capacity, there is a symbiotic relationship between adaptation and socioeconomic development. But, in the regions with limited climate capacity, irrational development may further damage the environment. Taking the Yangtze River delta, a region with high climate capacity, and a region of Ningxia, a region with limited climate capacity, as illustrative examples, the authors of this article analyzed the policy implications of climate capacity and further made suggestions on the problems of capacitylimited adaptation and development-driven adaptation. This article argued that the concept of climate capacity can not only be used as an analytical instrument of climate change economics, but also it can provide research support for planning regional adaptation and development with climate change impact and risk assessments.

SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

DE Agroecological practices; Animal production practices; Food system;
   Sustainable cropping practices; Organic farming
ID FOOD; MOVEMENT; ECOLOGY
AB There is ongoing debate among stakeholders about the future development of agricultural and food systems to meet the global challenges of food supply, biological and cultural diversity, climate change, and social justice. Among other options, agroecology and organic agriculture are discussed. Both have similar goals and use a systems approach; however, they are recognised and received differently by stakeholders. Here we review and compare principles and practices defined and described in EU organic agriculture regulations, International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movement (IFOAM) norms, and agroecology scientific literature. The main finding are as follows: (1) Regarding principles, EU organic regulations mainly focus on appropriate design and management of biological processes based on ecological systems, restriction of external inputs, and strict limitation of chemical inputs. IFOAM principles are very broad and more complete, and include a holistic and systemic vision of sustainability. Agroecology has a defined set of principles for the ecological management of agri-food systems, which also includes some socio-economic principles. (2) Many proposed cropping practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology, e.g. soil tillage, soil fertility and fertilisation, crop and cultivar choice, crop rotation, as well as pest, disease and weed management. In contrast, the origin and quantity of products potentially used for soil fertilisation and pest, disease, and weed management are different. Additionally, some practices are only mentioned for one of the three sources. (3) In animal production, only a few proposed practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology. These include integration of cropping and animal systems and breed choice. In contrast, practices for animal management, prevention methods in animal health, animal housing, animal welfare, animal nutrition, and veterinary management are defined or described differently. (4) Related to food systems, organic agriculture focusses on technical aspects, such as food processing, while in agroecology there is a prominent debate between a transformative and conformative agenda. Both agroecology and organic agriculture offer promising contributions for the future development of sustainable agricultural production and food systems, especially if their principles and practices converge to a transformative approach and that impedes the conventionalisation of agro-food systems.

AB Over the past decade, a series of controversies has arisen about equity and justice in the rooibos industry, centred both on the biological resource and on the traditional use and knowledge that fostered the growth of this lucrative trade. Accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have-taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. Claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous San and Khoi have also launched demands-to date unmet-for a stake in rooibos benefits. Meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. All remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the South African apartheid system.
   The melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as "the mother" and "testing ground" of so-called access and benefit sharing. Such approaches stem in part from the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. With growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry.
   Drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. Through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach.

AB The metamorphosis of the world is about the hidden emancipatory side effect of global risk. This article argues that the talk about bads produces common goods'. As such, the argument goes beyond what has been at the heart of the world risk society theory so far: it is not about the negative side effects of goods but the positive side effects of bads. They are producing normative horizons of common goods. This is what the author defines as emancipatory catastrophism'. Emancipatory catastrophism can be seen and analysed by using three conceptual lenses: first, the anticipation of global catastrophe violates sacred (unwritten) norms of human existence and civilization; second, thereby it causes an anthropological shock, and, third, a social catharsis.
   Resume La metamorphose du monde est induite par les effets emancipateurs et caches du risque mondial. Cet article soutient que le debat sur les maux produit des << biens communs >>. L'argument va au-dela de ce qui est au coeur de la theorie de la societe mondiale du risque ; il ne s'agit pas des effets secondaires negatifs des biens, mais des effets secondaires positifs des maux. Ils produisent des horizons normatifs pour les biens communs. C'est ce que j'appelle le << catastrophisme emancipateur >>. Le catastrophisme emancipateur peut etre vu et analyse en utilisant trois cadres conceptuels : premierement, l'anticipation d'une catastrophe mondiale transgresse les normes tacites de l'existence humaine ; deuxiemement, il engendre un choc anthropologique et troisiemement une catharsis sociale.
   Resumen La metamorfosis del mundo trata del oculto efecto secundario emancipatorio del riesgo global. Este trabajo sostiene que la charla sobre los males produce bienes comunes'. Como tal, el argumento va mas alla de lo que ha estado en el corazon de la teoria de la sociedad del riesgo mundial hasta el momento: no se trata de los efectos secundarios negativos de los bienes, sino de los efectos secundarios positivos de males. Estan produciendo horizontes normativos de los bienes comunes. Esto es lo que defino como catastrofismo emancipador'. El catastrofismo emancipador puede ser visto y analizado por el uso de tres lentes conceptuales: en primer lugar, la anticipacion de la catastrofe global viola las normas sagradas (no escritas) de la existencia humana y la civilizacion; segundo, por lo tanto, se provoca un shock antropologico, y, en tercer lugar, una catarsis social.

AB Alaskan wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe, but very little is known regarding exposure to wildfire smoke, a risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. We estimated long-term, present-day and future exposure to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across Alaska for the general population and subpopulations to assess vulnerability using observed data for the present day (1997-2010), modelled estimates for the present day (1997-2001), and modelled estimates for the future (2047-2051). First, we assessed wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure by estimating monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels across 1997-2010 for 158 Alaskan census tracts, using atmospheric transport modelling based on observed area-burned data. Second, we estimated changes in future (2047-2051) wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure compared to the present-day (1997-2001) by estimating the monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels for 29 boroughs/census areas (county-equivalent areas), under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario from an ensemble of 13 climate models. Subpopulation risks for present and future exposure levels were estimated by summing area-weighted exposure levels utilizing the 2000 Census and State of Alaska's population projections. We assessed vulnerability by several subpopulation characteristics (e.g. race/ethnicity, urbanicity). Wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure levels during 1997-2010 were highest in interior Alaska during July. Among subpopulations, average summer (June-August) exposure levels for urban dwellers and African-American/Blacks were highest at 9.1 mu g m(-3)and 10 mu g m(-3), respectively. Estimated wildfire-PM(2.5)varied by Native American tribe, ranging from average summer levels of 2.4 mu g m(-3)to 13 mu g m(-3)for Tlingit-Haida and Alaskan Athabascan tribes, respectively. Estimates indicate that by the mid-21st century, under climate change, almost all of Alaska could be exposed to increases of 100% or more in levels of wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels. Exposure to wildfire-PM(2.5)likely presents a substantial public health burden in the present day for Alaska communities, with different impacts by subpopulation. Under climate change, wildfire smoke could pose an even greater public health risks for most Alaskans.

AB Background: We are at a historical juncture that is punctuated by the rise of white nationalism, an exacerbation of racial divisions and tensions, an uptick in hate crimes, and bullying increasingly targeting immigrant youth, all of which, in the current political and cultural climate, have often been legitimized through a recourse to "alternative facts." However, the current historical moment in the United States is also marked by a postmodern ethos, which is often taken up by the public in a fragmentary manner, highlighted by a general sense of incredulity regarding any form of knowledge. At the same time, the fuller, ethical context of post-modernism complicates how educators may pedagogically address and respond to the tensions and conflict that filter over into the university classroom from the social strife and injustices evident in the society at large. The ethical context of postmodernism warns against changing hearts and minds with a proliferation of the "right' . "facts assumed to be devoid of attachments of value. It also warns us to be vigilant against the foreclosures, reductions, and exclusions that occur when one draws on metanarratives and universals to mobilize against injustice.
   Purpose: We explore what it means pedagogically, for teacher educators in predominantly white institutions, to be situated at a historical juncture that calls out for some form. of social advocacy on their part to combat the rise in the politicization of truth and xenophobic and racist sentiment, but are simultaneously compelled to keep in mind the ethical lessons of postmodernism.
   Research Design: We utilize critical phenomenological analysis intertwined with a narrative accounting of both authors' classroom. experiences as they attempt to engage college students at a predominantly white university with issues of racism, white privilege, and marginalization. We analyze and reflect on the mixed reactions of our students to a presentation on teaching in a diverse world, given by one of the authors to the other author's class of pre-service teachers.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: For teaching that may facilitate white students' ability to become reflective of their positionality as structured through whiteness and its attendant privilegrs, it is important to envision pedagogical work taking place within environments that can address not only students' cognitive capacities but also the white body schema, which operates at a pre-reflective level. Educators may refrain from reducing white students to reified categories of whiteness by cultivating a disposition of wonder that may allow them to understand whiteness through the lens of emergent realities rather than substantive, ontological forces.

AB Climate variability and changing cropping patterns are two main factors directly influencing catchment hydrological processes and agricultural productivity. Assessing the response of hydrological processes and agricultural production to the combined impacts is of great importance for enhancing water resources management, water productivity and agriculture sustainability. SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) models embedded with 2007 and 2018 land use were built for the San Joaquin watershed (SJWS) in California?s Central Valley. Global sensitivity analysis were conducted to select parameters that have the largest influence on evapotranspiration (ET) processes. The model was calibrated and validated produced good agreement for monthly ET from remote sensing and yield of 8 major crops using county level reported yields during the periods of 2001?2009 and 2010?2018. Based on the outputs of the calibrated SJWS SWAT model, regional ET showed a significant increase, which was caused by rises in temperature and changing cropping patterns associated with increase in area under nut crop production. Seven major crop yields increased excluding alfalfa, implying that the impacts of increasing temperature and small decreases in precipitation were not dominant factors in explaining observed changes in yield. From periods 2001?2009?2010?2018, total water productivity (WP) increased slightly from 2.11 to 2.15 kg/m3, associated with more water-intensive permanent crop production systems. Total economic water productivity (EWP) increased significantly by 111% from 0.55 to 1.16 US$/m3, which also indicated the substantial economic benefit brought to the SJWS by expanding the land area under high-EWP crops such as nut crops and vegetables. Nutritional water productivity (NWP) for energy, protein and fat were reduced from 1211 kcal/m3, 183 g/m3 and 105 g/m3 to 1141 kcal/m3, 111 g/m3 and 88 g/m3 during the period 2010?2018 mostly due to high water use. Total NWP for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg/m3, respectively. This study provides initial insights into the response of WP, EWP and NWP to the changing cropping patterns and climate variability for major crops in the SJWS, which could be used by a wide range of stakeholders including farmers, commodity boards, irrigation districts, groundwater sustainability basins, environmental justice groups and policy makers to optimize water resources planning and management. We recommend creating a comprehensive index that incorporates WP, EWP and NWP for making sustainable water resources planning and management decisions.

AB Various sectors of stakeholders (urban, agricultural, policymakers, etc.) are frequently engaged in participatory research projects aimed at improving water resources' sustainability. However, a process for comprehensive and integrative identification, classification, and engagement of all types of water stakeholders for a region or river basin, especially in a transboundary context, is missing for water resources research projects. Our objective was to develop a systematic approach to identifying and classifying water stakeholders, and engage them in a discussion of water futures, as a foundation for a participatory modeling research project to address the wicked water resource problems of the Middle Rio Grande basin on the U.S./Mexico border. This part of the Rio Grande basin can be characterized as having limited and dwindling supplies of water, increasing demands for water from multiple sectors, and a segmented governance system spanning two U.S. states and two countries. These challenges are being exacerbated by climate change; a transitioning agriculture to more water demanding, high value crops; urbanization; and growing demand for environmental services. Moving forward, a core question for this region is how can water be managed so that the three competing sectors-agricultural, urban, and environmental-can realize a sustainable future in this challenged water system? We identified the major water-using sectors who represent competing demands as including agricultural, municipal, self-supplied industrial users, environmental, and a sector we labeled "social justice", comprised of individuals who lack access to potable water, or who represent groups who advocate for access to water. We included stakeholders from both the U.S. and Mexico, which is seldom done, who share transboundary water resources in the region. We hosted a series of stakeholder dialogues and obtained results that identified and described their vision for the future of water; challenges to be overcome; and important research questions that could be addressed using participatory modeling approaches. Four broad themes common to multiple sectors emerged: (1) quantity, drought, and scarcity; (2) quality/salinization; (3) urbanization; and (4) conservation and sustainability. Each sector expressed distinctive views regarding the future of water. Agricultural stakeholders, in particular, had strong feelings of ownership of water rights as part of land ownership and a concomitant sense of threat to those water rights emanating from dwindling supplies and competing demands. The contribution of this work is a methodology for identifying, classifying, and engaging all types of stakeholders in the context of a research project, enabling us to compare and contrast views of different types of stakeholders. Heretofore, this has been accomplished in "bits and pieces", but never comprehensively and holistically.

AB The Introduction sets the tone for the book by outlining the main concepts, debates and applications illustrated by the various contributions in this volume. The theme of Local Food Systems (LFS) is a complex one, and therefore a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary effort, drawing on a myriad of research concepts and frameworks. The chapter begins by embedding the food debate within the broader sustainability discussion. It highlights issues around future demand and supply scenarios, current production and consumption patterns, and the challenges of addressing some of these issues in the context of climate change. The chapter also provides a review of some of the responses so far to counter the current unsustainability of the global agri-food system. Initiatives and concepts such as local food systems, localisation, food security and sovereignty are discussed, drawing on examples from both the Global North and South. Since the volume is about socio-metabolic approaches to agri-food systems, the chapter also introduces the conceptual and methodological underpinnings of this approach, and how this relates to political ecology, social conflicts and environmental justice. The chapter ends with an introduction to the various contributions in this volume that discuss the following cross-cutting issues: the necessity to consider local cases as nested in regional, national and global scales, including the debate on what might be an optimal scale for food regionalisation or sovereignty; the agenda of re-localisation and its political and ideological background in relation to biophysical/socio-metabolic insights with respect to LFS; the inclusion of trade in the methodological and ideological framework of LFS studies; the multi-functionality of agriculture and various related metrics of efficiency in agriculture (including the energy efficiency/EROI variables); the biophysical performance of other, more sustainability-focused, production regimes; the land-sparing versus land-sharing debate in connection to the biodiversity and landscape multi-functionality of both historical and existing agri-food systems; the role of livestock in various agri-food systems, and the related issue of meat consumption and dietary transition as part of a broader metabolic transition happening in many parts of the world; the issue of labour in terms of efficiency, and also in broader social and economic contexts; the political underpinnings of peasant livelihoods, existing social conflicts and uneven ecological exchange related to food; the issue of democratisation of food systems, access to means of production for fulfilling basic needs, and the agenda of food sovereignty. The contributors to this volume all ask the following two questions: Which local food systems or their particular characteristics can serve as the best practice examples for maintaining and designing more sustainable agri-food systems in the future? Which scientific and policy relevant insights can the socio-metabolic approach offer with respect to studying the sustainability of local food systems?

AB Mercury (Hg) emissions pose a global problem that requires global cooperation for a solution. However, neither emissions nor regulations are uniform world-wide, and hence the impacts of regulations are also likely to vary regionally. We report here an approach to model the effectiveness of regulations at different scales (local, regional, global) in reducing Hg deposition and fish Hg concentrations in the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL) region. The potential effects of global change on deposition are also modeled. We focus on one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, an Indigenous tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) with a high fish consumption rate. For the GL region, elements of global change (climate, biomass burning, land use) are projected to have modest impacts (<5% change from the year 2000) on Hg deposition. For this region, our estimate of the effects of elimination of anthropogenic emissions is a 70% decrease in deposition, while our minimal regulation scenario increases emissions by 35%. Existing policies have the potential to reduce deposition by 20% with most of the reduction attributable to U.S. policies. Local policies within the Great Lakes region show little effect, and global policy as embedded in the Minamata Convention is projected to decrease deposition by approximately 2.8%. Even within the GL region, effects of policy are not uniform; areas close to emission sources (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania) experience larger decreases in deposition than other areas including Michigan's UP. The UP landscape is highly sensitive to Hg deposition, with nearly 80% of lakes estimated to be impaired. Sensitivity to mercury is caused primarily by the region's abundant wetlands. None of the modeled policy scenarios are projected to reduce fish Hg concentrations to the target that would be safe for the local tribe. Regions like Michigan's UP that are highly sensitive to mercury deposition and that will see little reduction in deposition due to regulations require more aggressive policies to reduce emissions to achieve recovery. We highlight scientific uncertainties that continue to limit our ability to accurately predict fish Hg changes over time.
   Environmental significance
   Here, we project the responses within the Great Lakes region of rates of atmospheric deposition and fish mercury concentrations to changes in policy at multiple jurisdictional scales and to global change. We demonstrate that even within this region, responses to policy and global change drivers vary spatially with the largest reductions in deposition occurring in closer proximity to major Hg emission sources. Projected responses to atmospheric deposition are greater for U.S. policies than for either local or global Hg control policies. We focus further on the environmental justice implications of policy changes for fish mercury contamination facing one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, a tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with a high fish consumption rate. The Upper Peninsula is shown to be a highly sensitive landscape that readily converts atmospherically deposited Hg to bioaccumulated methylmercury, but one that will respond little to any of the policies evaluated. Thoughtful and more aggressive policy changes would be required to alleviate the existing environmental injustice.

DT Article
DE #FeesMustFall; Post-apartheid; Post-colonialism; radical politics;
   student protest; South African universities
AB This article concerns the wave of student protests that swept across South African universities during 2015 and 2016. The phenomenon of student protest at universities is approached and analysed against the backdrop of several macro political trends that are currently emerging in the South African context. It is argued that the most pronounced of these emergent trends is the radicalisation of South African politics and society. Widespread dissatisfaction with service delivery and the rendering of public goods by government have intensified calls for quicker and more radical political solutions to perceived socio-economic hardships. In this regard, the culture of service delivery protest stands out as a significant barometer of social dissatisfaction, despite the strides that have been made since 1994 in the improvement of basic quality of life in South Africa. Furthermore, and related to the aforementioned trend of radicalisation, there has occurred a clear burgeoning of the political left in South African politics. As social dissatisfaction has escalated over the last three to four years, new progressive and radical political actors have emerged in the landscape of institutionalised politics in order to capitalise on the prevalent alienation among citizens. Concurrently, established political parties have also adopted more progressive, and in some cases radical, policy and ideological positions. Together, these developments point towards a political playing field that is "shifting to the left", as it were. Furthermore, the aforementioned developments have taken place during an epochal change in the South African psyche, namely the expiration of the period known as "post-apartheid". The guiding values of tolerance, reconciliation and "rainbow nationalism" that characterised the post-apartheid period and political engagement are now conspicuously absent in South African politics. Instead, racial and economic class tensions have re-emerged and the political climate has become more confrontational and militant. Whereas the post-apartheid period was premised on forgiving the transgressions of apartheid and adopting a prospective orientation of future consolidation, South African society is now engaged in a retrospective re-interrogation of its colonialist past. Because of the confluence of these trends and circumstances, this article argues that it is possible to speak of the emergence of a post-colonial epoch in South Africa's historical trajectory. The notion of post-colonial South Africa is premised on numerous aspects which exist in a dialectical relationship with the history of the state and society. Among the most significant manifestations of this dialectic is the manner in which the post-colonial society engages critically with its institutions in an attempt to change and transform. Thus, as universities have become increasingly subject to such critical engagement by society, but spegfically by students, instability and conflict have arisen in the process of change and transformation. Various possible outcomes of such instability and change are considered in the article as universities, and formerly Afrikaans universities in particular, are faced with the challenges of responding to the demands of post-colonial politics and society. These demands include that universities become activist institutions that promote social justice, Africanisation and indigenisation, and the decolonisation of knowledge.
   In the process, it appears that the utility and value of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction and institutional language is disparaged with the purpose of annihilation, and furthermore that universities may increasingly become domains of ideological, and not intellectual, contestation. The article concludes by positing that the future of the university in a post-colonial local context will require a commensurate reconceptualisation of the role and functions of a university.

AB "Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive." When Sir Walter Scott penned these words, he probably did not have diversity or universities on his mind. Those of us that are genuinely engaged in diversity, inclusion, equity, social justice, and/or multicultural education work can ruminate on his words and think of how university campuses tout their diversity initiatives and sometimes brag about being the "most diverse" are in actuality deceiving themselves and the constituents they serve. Even though diversity awareness has become an important topic in academe in recent years, so many campuses have largely failed to address it in any substantive way, thus creating an environment where students and even employees sometimes become disengaged. Davies (2007) argues that "university leaders who claim openness to diversity do not acknowledge the presence or participation of Others in activities that are characteristic of a free and democratic society" (p. 154).
   Many institutions of higher learning honestly believe that in showcasing a campus program based around food, festival, or fun, they can check the diversity box. Yet, when diversity practitioners push the campus in becoming multicultural competent by addressing diversity outside the proverbial realm of "race," questions like, "Why are they doing this?" arise. The struggle to sustain a comprehensive and meaningful campus diversity program is real for many agents for change. In order for diversity advocates to have a seat at the table, the campus attitude and practice of "diversity need not apply" cannot continue to exist.
   Leaders within academia must be cognizant of their campus culture, which governs the law of the land. More importantly, it is vital to understand that sometimes your campus culture may not be receptive to cultural differences, although university verbiage may state, "We will promote diversity and maintain an environment that celebrates and values the many perspectives, cultures, and [...]" Institutions of higher learning in this new millennium (twenty-first century) are deeply entrenched in organizational culture that has become its cornerstone over time, and is resistant to change.
   Campus culture is real. Stewart and Dottolo (2005) state that universities should strive to ensure that any groups that fall outside of the traditional culture do not encounter an unwelcoming and threatening institutional environment. However, not every university strives or desires to create a campus climate where diversity is welcomed, celebrated, and/or embraced. It is paramount that educational institutions that serve diverse populations strive to become proficient in multiculturalism (Roach, 2004). Institutions of higher education are socially obligated to provide a learning environment for students with varied backgrounds (Bridges et al., 2008). It is essential that universities take a very close look at how they can contribute to the greater good of society by instilling a sense of worth in all students, regardless of ethnicity and other features of student identities. Williams and Swail (2005) argue that "attending college can be a liberating, developmentally powerful experience with the potential to increase individual productivity and, to some degree, the quality of life of the larger society" (p. 222). This can only occur if or when all aspects of diversity can apply and become an integral part of the university.

AB The Anthropocene refers to a geological epoch dominated by humans. Within this epoch atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biospheric and other earth systemic processes change due to human activity and can no longer only be ascribed to nature. The far-reaching effects of human activity lead to vulnerability of the earth system. One of the consequences of human activity that has a profound impact in the Anthropocene and that acts as a catalyst of vulnerability, is waste. In fact, Hecht (2018:111) has described the Anthropocene as the "apotheosis of waste ".
   Within the context of the Anthropocene this article explores Martha Fineman's vulnerability theory and Louis Kotze 's related and extended framework of earth systemic vulnerability. Both Fineman and Kotze argue for a destabilisation of traditional legal subjectivity Their point of departure is not the Western, liberal autonomous subject, but rather the universal vulnerable subject that demands a responsive state. A responsive state should produce sources of resilience to counteract universal vulnerability. Kotze 's theoretical extension of Fineman universal vulnerability to earth system vulnerability is in step with the nonhuman turn, a movement associated with the late twentieth century, and set on the decentering of humans. Instead, the movement accentuates the agency of nonhumans. By extending the universal vulnerable subject to be more inclusive and encompass the nonhuman subject as well, the vulnerability of other elements of the earth system can also be highlighted.
   Fineman's response to traditional notions of subjectivity emerged as a critique of formal equality. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the notion of the universal vulnerable subject is relevant in the South African context. The latter is characterised by a human rights approach advocating substantive equality. Although the South African approach to human rights therefore differs from the American one, Kotze highlights other shortcomings of human rights in the Anthropocene. They create space for vulnerability theory to enhance approaches to complex problems associated with the epoch. The concept of the universal vulnerable subject can, for instance, be utilised to question the anthropocentric approach to subjectivity.
   After establishing that vulnerability theory and earth system vulnerability can contribute to the South African socio-legal discourse on the Anthropocene, the authors explore earth systemic vulnerability of vulnerable subjects in the context of landfills. These vulnerabilities, cautions Kohn (2014:27), are not innate to the vulnerable subject but are produced by relationships between the subjects and their environments. Building on this proviso, the article demonstrates that earth systemic vulnerability is caused by relationships between vulnerable human and nonhuman subjects and the landfill environment on both micro- and macroecological levels. It traces personal, relational and institutional vulnerabilities of both nonhuman and human entities. The article traces nonhuman and human vulnerabilities related to microecological bacterial relationships in the context of waste decomposition in landfills, personal and relational vulnerabilities caused by relationships between waste pickers, other stakeholders and their environment, and eventually global relationships that expose personal, relational and institutional vulnerability of macroecologies.
   By introducing a broad and expansive universal vulnerable subject inclusive of nonhuman entities, the authors endeavour to contribute to the legal theoretical foundation of waste management by advocating a progressive approach to waste theory. This analysis is analogous to similar work done within the context of climate change. Within the Anthropocene there is room for theoretical work using a wider lens that not only concentrates on the local context, but rather highlights the vulnerability of micro- and macroecologies. Due to scope considerations two other aspects of the vulnerability analysis will be considered in a forthcoming article, in which we will consider how vulnerable subjects use sources of resilience to counter earth system vulnerability and investigate the role of the responsive state in the creation of sources of resilience.

AB The article offers an overview of language policy review at the University of the Free State (UFS), from the inception of the university council's 2003 language policy up to the adoption of an entirely new policy in March 2016. This overview is undertaken against the background of theoretical insights about the role of the evaluation of effective policy implementation in policy review at higher education institutions. Several studies as well as some institutional reports since then have suggested that the UFS language policy needed to be reconsidered in view of drastically changing demographics in particular The underlying question that is considered in terms of relevant documentation available in the public space is therefore why the UFS did not respond earlier to warnings about the inappropriateness of a policy that had been implemented under completely different conditions back in 2003. Departing from international studies on policy review, the study specifically looks at the role of regulative factors in policy review. This is done in terms of an analysis of external core reports that, as far back as 2006 already, recorded shortcomings requiring corrective actions by the UFS. The role of specifically two reports published during 2008, namely the Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) institutional audit report and the Ministerial Committee's report on transformation and social cohesion and the elimination of discrimination in public higher education institutions (the so-called Soudien report), are considered. Incidentally, they are also foregrounded in a transformation report issued by the UFS towards the end of 2014, which turns out to have provided a basis for reinventing language problems that could eventually be used as a rationale for changing the UFS language policy.
   As these reports have identified a range of shortcomings in the 2003 language policy, the study was specifically interested in how the mentioned transformation report presented these findings and how the UFS responded aspects the transformation report omits. From publicly available documents, it is clear that the UFS has indeed responded appropriately and even revised aspects of implementing the existing language policy. With the changeover to a new leadership during 2009, these measures were not followed through and not even mentioned at all after 2010. Among others, the study finds that the UFS nevertheless did attempt language policy revisions in 2010 and 2012, which led to instilling a more pragmatic approach to language policy implementation. After the 2010 review, the notion was adopted of a university that (still) used English and Afrikaans as media of instruction, but not necessarily within a framework of absolute parallel-medium teaching and where English was used as a kind of mediating language within multicultural situations. Other policies were revised to reflect this new approach, among them the policy on the UFS's branding identity, employment equity and integration in hostels. After the 2012 revision, the notion was adopted that parallel-medium education will be offered where possible and practicable and that the use of Southern Sotho within the teaching and learning environment will be increased. These measures partly responded to the dwindling number of Afrikaans students that still opted for Afrikaans classes (by 2012 already below 30% of all students). The changes resulting from these two reviews notably went further than the corrective actions undertaken before 2010 under the former management. They were nevertheless not mentioned in the UFS's transformation report, nor did they feature in the 2015 review process.
   In order to reconstruct the entire 2015 language review process (which is the actual focus of the study), the run-up to the surprising announcement about a language policy review is studied in some detail. Neither the 2014 annual institutional report nor the UFS's 2015-2020 strategic plan (finalised towards the end of 2014) mentions any of the kind of concerns about the institutional language policy that were raised during 2015. On the contrary, this strategic plan in particular still reaffirms the status quo position regarding language. One therefore has to assume that consistent pressure from the Department of Higher Education and Training by means of the mechanisms envisaged by the 2008 Soudien report, the role of the Director of the UFS's Institute for Reconciliation and Social Justice and the increased demand for transformation from student quarters as a by-product of the #RhodesMustFall campaign, have all contributed to a change of heart by the university management regarding the language issue. In stark contrast with the position adopted towards the end of 2014, it was subsequently argued that the 2003 language policy was found to be inappropriate to promote "transformation at the institution", a phrase that began to be propagated in official announcements and press releases.
   The article concludes that, because of a degree of neglect to execute actual language policy revisions (and thereby aligning revisions made in other policies) the university's management was eventually caught off guard by increased demands for transformation from all quarters. By inadvertently creating a hostile intellectual climate about the position of Afrikaans, the leadership could probably succeed without any policy revision to remove the existing bilingual language policy and replace it with a predominantly monolingual language policy. One therefore wonders whether Afrikaans became the culprit for the lack of proper and regular evaluation of a range of measures that were implemented at different stages in an attempt to realign the 2003 language policy with the changing circumstances at the UFS. In the end, this case demonstrates the importance of a meta-policy that helps to steer a university such as the UFS through troubled waters within an overall unstable higher education environment.

TI Direct violence and distributive conflicts about water.The evolution of
   analytical debate and the proposal of a new approach
SO RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Water; social distributive conflict; direct violence; intervention;
   governance
AB The article pursues two objectives: a) to comparatively trace the debates on the relationship between armed conflicts or direct violence and situations of stress / water shortage or distributive confrontations (resources or shared basins, for example) surrounding water, and in doing so add to the systematization of recent approaches; and b) based on the results of the aforementioned, propose new tools for the analysis and intervention in these conflicts, taking advantage, by way of example and not of detailed analysis, of ten current and heterogeneous cases of distributive conflicts over water.
   This issue became popular in the nineties of the twentieth century with striking statements that proclaimed: "the next wars would not be for oil or mineral resources but for access to drinking water" In this sense, the current paper focuses on examining the debate between 1985 and 1995, where the dominant issue was on whether water scarcity or water competition could be a direct causal factor of violent conflicts, or if it was simply a multiplier or accelerating factor linked to other causes. These contributions, while previously dominated by the omnipresence of approaches and texts based on security studies and the then so called "ecological security", are now based on contributions from studies of the analysis, resolution and transformation of conflicts. Meanwhile, new epistemological reflections respectful of cultural and gender bias are also present, along with non-western-centric approaches.
   Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, factual changes, new narratives, and novel guidelines for analysis have urged scholars to revisit the debate on the present and future relationships between armed conflict -or direct violence- and the scarcity or competition for water resources. I have just mentioned factual changes, among which I will highlight the following: significant ongoing changes in geopolitics and geo-economics; changes in the location and nature of direct violence, given that 80% of homicide deaths in the world are not related to direct violence of a clearly political nature (that is, armed conflict and terrorism), something that is linked with the strong growth of private security actors (legal and illegal) and a partial loss of the state's monopoly on the massive instruments of violence; ongoing mutations in the nature and spread of power; a progressive de-westernization of the international system and of the ways of analyzing it (international theory); the emergence of climate change and the climate emergency agenda and, in addition, the pandemics linked to recurrent zoonosis processes; and, to close this list, and returning to the topic being studies in this issue of the journal, the central position that water occupies in the 2030 agenda and in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, we need new tools that allow us to analyze and better understand these conflicts related to water, in general, and also their occurrences in the major geopolitical areas of the world in the coming decades (Asia,Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean).
   Regarding the new narratives and analysis guidelines, the paper focuses on the new approaches in the area of analysis, resolution and transformation of conflicts that have emerged from the consensus on liberal peace, along with contributions from political ecology specialized in distributive environmental conflicts and environmental justice. Taking into account these new epistemological reflections, including those related to identity, is important as it allows one to focus on causality, and the tools that facilitate its analysis
   In addition to its introduction and conclusions, this article has three sections.The first establishes a factual starting point, summarizing the data related to fresh drinking water. Through a succinct description of ten conflicts, both intra and international, and from various continents and regions, this establishes a central thesis: the most significant conflict causation factor is not so much the lack of water, but the management and governance of water in general and its shortages. Secondly, it summarizes the analysis and the results of the debate on water conflicts, in particular on the causation links between water use and scarcity and direct violence from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s of the last century.The third section presents new perspectives, based not on security studies or ecological security, as before, but on the consolidated works of peace research, and studies on conflict analysis and transformation. Specifically, the main contributions and findings are displayed, and, also, a seminal framework to apply them to water conflicts, through three assumptions and seven theses. Finally, the conclusions insist on the need to treat these conflicts as social conflicts, showing that their specificity is linked to the management and governance of the resource rather than the scarcity itself.
   In the concluding remarks, the paper highlights that the most pertinent features of any analysis and intervention in environmental conflicts, especially those that are persistent and difficult to resolve (what American literature usually calls "intractable" conflicts) do not reside in the adjective "environmental", or "hydric", as the mainstream suggested in the first half of the 1990s. What is really meaningful is that they are social conflicts, basically distributive conflicts, and linked to the search for fairer solutions; that is, related to the allocation, use and / or management of environmental goods.
   The specificity provided by the adjective "environmental" or "hydric" exists, of course, beyond its growing importance for the contextual reasons already mentioned -such as demographic pressure, climate change or pollution and destruction of resources. However, this does not justify a differentiated treatment for these conflicts, as was the case previously. They are social conflicts, and therefore marked by cultural and contextual differences. Therefore, this means that they must be analyzed and intervened upon, in order to manage, resolve and transform them, with the same tools and techniques used for all the social distributive conflicts.We can call them "environmental", or"hydric" if that is the case, but only if this means that we do not stop dealing with them as social conflicts. And moreover, we must not forget that like most of these conflicts, it is necessary to apply "analytical filters" to them based on knowledge of the logic of collective action, public goods and collective goods
   Finally, the paper argues that these conflicts and the new analytical and resolutions framework force us to modify the famous formula of "thinking globally, acting locally".Today, to tackle them, you also have to think in a multidimensional way, and, in many cases, act globally. In doing so, the paper emphasizes the governance and governance challenges that need to be addressed.

TI Solidarity and the problem of structural injustice in healthcare
SO BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE healthcare; justice; solidarity
ID JUSTICE
AB The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and equality by advocating 'standing with' or aiding fellow community members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake, when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks, personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles. Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity, or indeed, any use of the term that posits an 'other' against which solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely, structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity needs to show how it is connected to justice.
   It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts, but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely. They advance the following definition: 'Solidarity is an enacted commitment to carry "costs" (financial, social, emotional, or otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature, it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states. Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a 'civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of that European model in their understanding (though their conception is supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity).
   Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing 'costs' with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term 'costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity, one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked by assistance for others who are perceived as 'different' from oneself, rather than as being 'similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect, inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of what is perceived as 'similar' and what counts as 'a relevant respect,' remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such as these and also explicate what counts as 'similar in a relevant respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental reciprocity or 'tit for tat' reciprocity.
   In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity. This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine. But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle. Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use. This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged. Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside these groups' borders.
   Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational relationships take a networked form and involve relations to 'outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is explicitly understood as 'weak solidarity,' namely, 'the willingness to take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the requirement 'to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic of 'strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and 'caring for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated with the motto of the three musketeers: 'One for all and all for one,' but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as involving a clear awareness of a 'we' or 'us'. Although some sense of a 'we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see.
   In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as 'similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing 'we' in the context of collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an instance of what I have elsewhere called 'common activities,' the norms go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed 'equal positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency, no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them. In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents requires a set of conditions, both material and social.
   Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals' fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely, but also can be said to constitute 'the other side of justice' (in Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals. The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further, the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics. Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it. These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but may also include networking to help alleviate suffering.
   As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged, we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals) undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then, we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The 'we' in the case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination, oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the 'we' should remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states.
   Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups, if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice. That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor. Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.) More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the existing housing stock.
   According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people as a result of structural processes in which many people participate.
   These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure, Young argues, turns our attention to 'how the institutions of a society work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which people stand give rise to what she calls a 'forward looking' sense of political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather, some have substantial control over the processes to which others are subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if the solidarity actions are to be effective.
   For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the impacts of the structural features of political economy and the injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor. In such cases, effective action must not only support workers individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that simply 'incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice, these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development and for participating in processes of collective self-determination. This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g., among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global, justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated within these movements themselves.
   I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective about these effects of the structural context in which they function, and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and various political and economic transformations are also needed. But solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system). Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice.
   There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice, rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the 'power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society, which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law. Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities. Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required. Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
   They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in various locales across the United States, including rural areas and those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been important for understanding and addressing the social and economic factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters, e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes. Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African Americans made up 80% of the people in flooded low-lying communities, sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than 1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where there were radically insufficient medical supplies available.
   In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75% of Haiti's healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian authorities, and over 90% of the aid money went to international actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid, too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017. This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti, we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts, but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S. government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects, establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would be necessary for the social transformative changes required.
   Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017. Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty. Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself, we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org, among many others. In the international context, mention should also be made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the 'White Helmets' operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case, since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis, Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the use of these databases.
   For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed, one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek, as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data. Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they would decide against contributing their own information, despite assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the very existence and continuation of these structural background conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice, if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these databases and they argue that only 'broad consent' is needed for the use of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal health data for use in medical databases.
   This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and their openness to corporate use of the included health information in the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social, technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks. This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use the qualification 'quasi' here to indicate that the input in question may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for formal rights of participation on governance boards by some representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of 'personalized medicine' or 'precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson.
   The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender, race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted. Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input. This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies, a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice.

INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation. More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for 'standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group with 'networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare, discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of solidarity in view.

AB Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years 2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as 'good medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran. Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9% for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001). Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion: Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases. The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of 'unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95 had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166 patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by 7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A search equation using the following MeSH terms 'big data, data mining, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice, electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian. Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods: HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and 0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients, patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations, barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group. Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12 patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention. Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures. GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared. Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change. Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another. Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.

AB When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice.
   A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc.
   ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'.
   Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice.
   Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics.
   After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world.
   In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP.
   As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects.
   We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health.
   European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making.
   In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place.
   On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action.
   Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.
